1,To anyone reading these reviews who is confused by the massive swings between positive and negativeyou need to know one thing Darkest Dungeon is an emotional game To people just starting outit can seem bafflingunfairand deliberately obscure To people who have been playing since Early Accessand who have seen favourite party compositions and strategies rendered obsoletethe Steam reviews page is more of an extension of Reddit than anything else  a place to air grievances legitimate or otherwise over a game that they have dedicated a lot of time toI would say the following the core gameplay is rock solid At its heartDarkest Dungeon has taken a minimalistturnbasedfourman combat system and imbued it with massive potential for tactical thought and personal flair Figuring out the best role for each of your heroes chosen from a fairly generous pool of classes and suddenly realising a unique way of getting them to synergise is immensely gratifying Unlike a lot of gamesit doesnt feel like there is a a ringfenced area of correctvanilla play that only the very highlevel players can get past insteadyou are encouraged and rewarded for coming up with your own strategies from the get go The central combat system is smartit pushes you to experimentand there is a lot of room to come up with a playstyle that feels like your ownunique creationit would be a neat tabletbased distractionbut ultimately sterile It is the stuff that comes layered on top of it that is the source of its intrigue  and also the source of a lot of the frustration youll see directed at it As a typical RPG playeryou naturally do everything you can to guarantee the safety and efficacy of your charactersand it feels inherently uncomfortable to work in a game environment that leaves you perpetually on your toes and at risk of failure DD refuses to let you settle into a comfortable routineand a massive enemy critical attackan ambush in pitchdark while campingor a series of misses on your part can topple you from a seeminglyunassailable position to a very desperate one The potential for a failcascade is what turns off many new playersand even drives experienced ones to the occasional ragereviewbut it is also vital to the fundamental riskreward balance of the gamewhich is designed to punish complacency and encourage the utmost thought on your partyou constantly need to balance a dwindling supply of lightfoodsanity and health although they can be restored in some wayswhile also trying to complete objectives and collect muchneeded loot with limited backpack space Usuallythis is the sort of gameplay I dislike feeling that there is a timelimitthat I cant plough through something at my own speed in relative safetyis an uncomfortable experience after most games Howeverthe actual result is some very effective tension In a normal RPG say Diablothe steady drip of everincreasing numbers is satisfying in a functional sort of waybut in DD the stakes are so high that getting a critical hit or dodging a huge attack always feels like a i moment i rather than just a nice bonussince most gamers are hardwired to see a hero death which is permanenta catastrophic turnaroundor a tactical retreat as a failure Likewisethe element of randomness can make it feel like your hard work and smart play has not been rewardedlike youre just a random collection of atoms buzzing around in a meaningless void where there is no God or higher authority to dispense justice or distinguish right or wrong It takes time to realise that you were never i meant i to have it easythat its i always i been a gambleand you cant expect a perfect S ranking  all you can do is make the best play you can with the information you have It takes time to realise that the game is pushing you to accept loss and difficulty as part of the gamerather than a failurebecauseas I saidDarkest Dungeon is an emotional game You invest real time and fake money in your group of heroesthe odds are massively stacked in the Houses favournone of your guys is going to come out unscarredyou are going to face some serious setbacksbut you return because actually making itactually landing that last hit at the last possible momentrealising youve scraped through againis always a surpriseand an amazing one at thatRemind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killerThe stress mechanics in game affects you in real life6 hours into the game and I write this review because Ive read people mentioning the most simple and constant fact about this game that it is brutal Dont expect to always winor that everyone will always survive Somebody will eventually diesomebody will eventually go insaneand after that theres just more of that This games throws whatever it can to make you loseand even if you win the biggest of fights you wont always be able to win in the end Why Because this game takes planning and thinking forward to the extremeand it will trick you into overextending in some way just so that you will die And thats greatbeing an RPGhas many stats and many mechanics that interact in one way or another with everything else Then why draw a point to it Because you must NEVEREVER underestimate or overestimate those values The fact that an attack has 8 of hit chance vs a 95 hit chance is huge in the early levelsand as you go up in difficulty those rifts keep getting bigger and biggerspecially when you can find enemies in the early levels with evasion as high as 25 It means you need to plan for it The fact that an enemy can inflict stress damage to your partythat it can protect another enemyand that it has particular resistances to certain status can change drastically your aproach to each encounterand the fact that depending on where youre going you will be facing a specific group of enemies plus some more generic ones It means you need to plan for it The fact that you can specialize certain classes to be more oriented towards a particular role most of the time and that you have only so much money at hand to do soand that you need to divide it between thatbuying better gear so that they wont die and further specialize them and keeping them sane It means you need to plan for it If nothing elsethis game is a game about planning as carefully as you canletting as little to chance as you can Because the more you leave up to chancethe higher the chances something will wipe you outor that youll drive yourself into a corner you may not want to go intoas many other reviewers have saidthe game gets too hard if you care too much about all of your characters Having to take care of a roster of up to 26 somewayoranother twisted people can only get you so farand you wont always be able to keep them safe or have enought money to do so It is ultimately your choice if you wish to stop caring about everyone but the ones you like the mostor if you wish to go as far a you can trying to veil for both your interests and your whole partys safetyyou must learn about everything anything in the game can doand plan accordingly to thatALWAYS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT WHAT HAPPENS IF EVERYTHING GOES WRONG If you knows there are enemies that arent weak to a specific kind of ailmentdont take too many characters that rely on that kind of ailment to do their stuff If you know an enemy can heal or deal more damage than anotherpriotize getting rid of either it or the next biggest threat there is besides it If you know your characters have quirks or traits that affect them in certain scenariostake those too into account when choosing your party and where to goif not also how much stuff to take to that mission If youre trying to kill a enemy that is quite devastating but it can evade everything you throw at himdont always try to kill it with everything if you are leaving more vulnerable targets that you can kill with less effort stacking up bits of damage against you Every actionevery healthevery missevery hitevery fight and every event inside the dungeons can make a huge difference when stacked So try to always think over whats the optimal way of doing stuff andif you dont want to get everyone killedwhen youre far enough gone that your only reasonable option is to run away Luck can be in your favorbut never try to abuse itif luck screws you overor if you try to do more than you can But if you really want to apreciate ityou must deal with every loss and every deathevery failed resolve check and every lossand learn from it Try to learn how much is too muchhow little is too littlewhat corners can be cut and what corners cannot Learn what works with what and what doesnt And if you really dont want to losedont feel bad if you need to go to the wikia to check on what will be expecting you on your next mission Knowledgeand knowing how to use it properlyis the only thing you can rely on this gameand if you dont want the frustrating trialanderror you need to get itno shame in getting it from someone else Its not as if it tells you everythingbut starting from it as a basis and then piling up experience will get you to know the gameto really feel when things will go wrongand if you can deal with a particular situationDarkest Dungeon is really hardbut it can be a rewarding experience It is opressive by designsince thats how Red Hook wanted it to feel likejust so that every little victory you get is ever the sweetestand every failureif you learn from ita word on caution and the knowledge on how lessen the chances of it repeating itself Only get it if you think you can deal with stuff not always going according to planno matter how well crafted if may beand getting crushed by letting minuscule things piling up Those are the bread and butter of the game until you start to get the hang of how to manage those situationsand the real enjoyment of the game besides maybe a bit of masochism can only be gotten after iteven if luck can screw you overbut all of them add something interesting enough to the gamehbuDisclaimeru There is an ongoing issue with the Korean translation In response to thatmany players are leaving a negative review to stick it to the developer In my humble opinionthe game itself is good My level of information concerning the translation éclat is very superficialbut I must stress that before you believe any statementsplease do the educated thing and research this topic a bit Thanks for staying objective herenow on to the actual reviewbhI have come to appreciate more challenging games like the Dark Souls Series It always takes a bit of an effortbecause if you want to succeed in such gamesyou need to deal with the mechanics and principles behind the gameplay and deepen your knowledge My philosophy with Dark Souls was always that it was not hard in itself as long as you listened to the games messages and acted accordinglyyour heroes will refuse to go on low level missions once they have earned their wings The conclusion is that planning is key You need to get a mental grip on the game really fast and then plan the development of your hamlet along with the development of your heroes And once you have accepted that the heroes are expendablethe world wont look so grim anymoreeach of which comes with 4 active skills and their current equipment You go on a mission with a clear goal and with limited resources that cost you gold for each piece you chose to take along In combatyou have a maximum of 4v4 scenario with turn based combat The outcomes are influenced by chanceeg your damage range might be 5  which would make a  lucky and a 5 unlucky In that regardit is very much like a classical RPG when it comes to statsabilities and chancethe area and the game in generalyou can plan ahead and even prevail if RNG is trying to rattle you It happens that you get wreckedbut if you learn from that experienceyou wil know what to improve for the next tryId say the bdifficultyb remains challenging and taxing even as you get stronger There are basically 3 tiers of enemy strengthsand once your heroes reach a higher levelthey need to go on higher tier missionsas previously pointed out Gold and resources for the developtment of your hamlet are limited and you need to manage your playstyle in a way that does not leave you bankrupt after a few missions Chosing which heroes to improve and which to let go is a part of that Your heroes get positive and negative quirks attribute modifiers which can be healed or lockedas well as maladies Its not always worth to spend your hard earned moola on a hero who has taken a wrong turn So againan appropriate reaction is keyyou can use higher level heroes for lower level missions Yayso dont expect a cheerful tuneso I cant comment on them But the changes to the core game that came with the DLC seem to be reasonable The devs have their vision of Darkest Dungeon and so they do not allow cheesingwhich is fine by me So if other reviews put that down as a negative pointthen id wager they were too lazy to play the game the way it was intended and are now out of their depths with what they have leftI would like to thank you for taking your time to read my thoughts There is more to the game than I have written down herebut I dont need to make a dissertation out of it and I have faith that you get the idea of the game by looking at the pictures and watching the videos provided by the dev I can really recommend Darkest Dungeonprovided that you can manage the above mentioned hurdles Its not a game to relax and it can drive you up the wallsso dont play when youre already salty I can really really recommend the game Slime Rancher for that Its too cutespoilerFor all the old DD players out there Darkest Dungeon is a digitally enhanced and massively prolonged interpretation of Tomb of Horrorsdepressing art designmassive content and very polished turnbased partyoffour battleslack of equipmentlack of torches and pretty much lack of anything you would ever need to succeed in your missionsoh noRNG screws you over Bad game is badbut will when they get hit for 4 crits in a row They wont care when they dodge 6 timesbut will when the enemy dodges 6 times The game is about minimalizing the RNGJust note that the RNG will still be there  It is also about minimalizing the affect of a bad situation if things start going south You can retreat from combat You do not need to fight it out Start a campaignGameplay GoodThe sin is not in being outmatchedbut in failing to recognize itand victory will comestrategyand turnbased combat It is being hotfixed and getting adjustments to certant things regularly by the developers to make it a better experienceI may have thought that the game was unfair too Howeverafter watching multiple other people play this game modless on all difficultiesit is clear that skill is involved and you can improve So with that in mindI will continue on to improve as wellgetting me interested in this gameand jealous of all the gold you aquired Hey Red Hookcredit goes to her Give her a button for buying your game when she is offlinegiving tips on how to playand making Torchless look easyI renamed all the heroes with my friends name and it didnt take long before everyone I loved had died An abusive relationshipiRemind Yourself That Overconfidence Is A Slow And Insidious KilleriI feel like I have to post a new review because all of the reviews that are preDecembersite problems that have been addressed Red Hook released a huge bug fix and ease of use patch that was specifically designed so that players who dislike certain mechanics like the stress for delaying a fight can just turn them off Red Hook is a company that does pay attention to the player basethe problem is that the player base is greatly divided There is also an extremely vocal minority running a massive smear campaign on the internetgoing so far as creating new steam accounts for the sole purpose of going through every positive comment and marking them unhelpful While I dont want to get into thatif you wantyou can absolutely find information about ityou may have seen a certain top reviewI urge you to look at his time played in the last two weeks which includes the time since the game was actually releasedand notice that he has not played the game since the releasewhich means he cannot say whether or not the content has improved He has been attacking the game for monthsand was as far as I can tell initially enraged by the fact that the devs were not interested in incorporating his opinion into their artistic visionplease keep this in mind when considering your purchaseand Ive been playing since early summer It has come incredibly farand anyone who says otherwise is making snap judgementsor flat out lying Darkest Dungeon has XCOM levels of difficulty It has XCOM level WTF moments Occasionally you will miss 99 chance to hit attacksand occasionally enemies will get nigh impossible critical strings But just like XCOMthrough base building and experienceyou can minimize risk and become a force to be reckoned withbut not nearly as hard as most negative reviews would lead you to believe Most of them say things like The devs have been trying to remove every winning strategy or the game is antifun nowbut in realityI havent met any players new to the game that have problems with it This leads me to believe that throughout the development of the gameplayers found certain strategies that were drastically overpowered which is why in the discussion boardsthere are players that rant about the game being too easyand the devs introduced changes which reduced the efficacy of these imbalanced strategies which in any other game would be considered a balance patchbut apparently in this gamepeople think it is intended to be funkilling One of these strategies early on was to get 4 of the same classand use the exact same attack every turn until you won everything This is no longer possible This seems like a reasonable balance patch to meyou might not get that much time out of itbut for contextout of the current 3 difficulty tiers of dungeonsI didnt hit level 2 until 8ish hours I really hope you give this game a chanceI would like to make something clearthis game is not XCOM It does not have XCOMs production value or qualityand it is not worth 6 dollars It is certainly worth its current price tagand buying it on sale is a no brainerI can say that the devs really came throughthey added a huge number of improvements and content with the final release I recommend this game and it will only get better from hereas there are free content updates scheduled for the next few monthsThis is not one of those games for perfectionists Your monument to success here is built atop a mountain of failures And that mountain will be staggering Your characters will dieeither going down swinging valiantly or from something extremely stupid because the entire world was out to get them at that particular moment Learn to cut and run and use the resources you gained to upgrade your various systems in town to better maintain the next batch of troops Sometimes youre just using recruits as stepping stones to get more upgrades to maintain your main fighting forcewho are still traumatized from their last incursion or who are getting their negative traits tortured out of them in a medieval sanitarium The game is designed around thisit expects you to do thisand it will passiveaggressively chide you for doing it You burn through more recruits than a standard game of XCOM UFO Defenseand thats an accomplishmentis the game good Extremely It is remarkably complexdifficult and addicting You will almost never have an ideal scenarioso you have to learn to adapt to every scenariolearn who or what is worth investing inand work towards that as your goal Another body in the ground is another cobblestone on your road to successand expect the ground to be littered with more corpses of adventurers than you will remember To you it was the most important day in your life when you saw your companions die from a heart attackbleed to deathand get mangled by a buzzsawbut for meit was Tuesdayand soon enoughit will be Tuesday for you as wellUm Yesyoure going to suffer in some way or anotheryoure going to be annoyed because its too hard or unfairyoure going to love it because its actually challenging and funyoure going to hate it if you hate turnbased partybased gamesuntil i got into the final dungeonmore ways to trymore ways to dieto sounds and overall gameplay But do consider starting on the easiest difficulty  its a tiny bit more forgiving but that makes the game more tolerable Unless you like to torture yourselfthen do whateverYou say you like hard games  Youve played Dark Soulsand thats your jam  Youre looking through steam titles for something new to tryand this game shows up  Let me tell you  THIS IS NOT DARK SOULSyou like hard games which rely on perfect timings and knowledge of the individual frames each move takes up  This isnt that sort of game  Its difficultbut its strategically difficult  You will always have time to think over your decisions before you make them  This also means that in order to prevent there always being one perfect movethere is an element of RNG in this game  Some people enjoy itsome people hate itsome people use it as an excuse for losing  I hate to break it to youbut if youre losing youre probably making poor decisions  Just because you lowrolled an occultist heal and that caused a character to die doesnt mean you lost to RNG  Maybe you went for damage instead of throwing out a stun  Maybe you didnt bring any stuns  There are many decisions that go into every consequence in this gameand although you might think you are playing perfectlyyoure probably not  I know I make mistakes quite oftengive it a try  Remember an element of RNG does not mean your decisions dont matter  If youre playing correctlyyoull pull through  But you will lose characters  You will be forced to explore in the darkas your gold runs out and stresses run highrecall these wise words  Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killerThe negative reviews are over a translation  This game is phenomenalWhatever that can go wrong in this gamebwill go wrongb in this gamewhy is there so many hentai mods for this game
1,Im really enjoying the challenge Im 68 years old and havent done much gamingOnce i got the hang of how to play its a good game Im in my 6s and dont play a lot of games but i like this oneThis game changed my outlook on cleaning At first I was likeI dont clean in real lifewhy would I want to ever do it in a game Then I tried itand it was overwhelmingly theraputic Day after I bought itI tackled my room Piece by piece I broke it down into a flow chart and did it piece by piece like I did in game Now my bed is made and my closet has space 11 the feeling of achievement translated into the real worldOnly thing this game needs is WORKSHOPplease let comunity mod this gameIm going to start my review by saying that Ive had this game during beta and it has come a long waybut as with most games out there there are also bad thingsit works nicely and after getting some perks you will see all the dirt is so its quicker to cleanthis can be a deal breaker for some as after that its just buying and flipping housessome have nuclear bunkersbut most of them are just the same style house and roughly the same shapes and sizesthere is no lawn mowingno outdoor gardening all you can do is change the panels outsidebut only on a single storeythere is no way to panel a second story currentlyand a lot of it is datedthere are also no kitchen wall cabinetsand Im not talking about the cockroachesim talking about game bugs One that Ive noticed is that the more lights you have on the less frames you will get Ive only noticed this on the highest graphic setting but its still a bugthe devs are working on it stilland it has a lot of potentialI love this gameoddly satisfying and great attention to detail But Devs please put customizable controlsIm a disabled gamer and use a MMO mouse to play every game I have adapted so far but it means I cant be as effecient enough and that frustrates me If you had them I will play this to death 117 would recommendI love this game I play with my Mom We each buy a house on Saturdays and then we renovate and decorateand do the garden during the week Then on Saturdays we have a little showandtell We do the Garden Competition and then put the house on auction So we kinda do our own version of The Block TV showmy Mom is a retired 6 something grandmaPLS MAKE IT COOP OR MULTIPLAYERMy daughter bought this game for me as I had shown a passing interest in it whilst watching her playso I guess you could say it worked out to be quite an expensive game DIm now at 1 hours played Garden Flipper gave it the much needed boost to keep me interested  For a whilebut these improvements are coming out few and far between VR may be a great improvementbut not for a lot of peoplelike mewho dont have a VR headset HonestlyI think more people would have been happy if the store items had been greatly increased  Yeah okweve had things addedbut players have been asked more than once for ideasbut our suggestions have largely gone ignored  We still only have the same 3 original coloured carpets How difficult can it be to make a different colour Red or pink for exampleonly time will tell EventuallyI play a lot less than I used to and sometimes find myself exiting the game mere minutes after loading itit was still worth the money that my daughter paid for the base game and the money I spent on the garden dlcIm going to start my review by saying that Ive had this game during beta and it has come a long waybut as with most games out there there are also bad thingsit works nicely and after getting some perks you will see all the dirt is so its quicker

to cooperate with some furniture corpslike IKEAso as to introduce their furniture MeanwhileI wish you can develop a function to let us freely design the house layoutthus I am able to design my new apartment in your softwareand this will be a fantastic room designing simulator as wellI really didnt want to give this a thumbs down I really didnt I am a big supporter of indy games and i have nothing against this one personallyIve completed all 2 missionsrenovated all 2 homes 7K in the bankbut this is the only way to save this game unless the DEVs plan on working like mad to make new homesitemsand missions16 GB ramCore i7 7th Gen and I lagged like crazy whenever I turned on the lightsyou can forget about changing all of its color or siding You can reach some of it but not all of itso many items to purchase if they only allowed this You can tell their art team is pretty limited too as most of the homes are the same exact house type but just a little bigdifferent shapeetcchances are you lost your progress And this game does have a tendancy to crash here and thereI dont think they are shadey or liars or anything like that you may see in negative reviews I just do not think its worth the 2 bucks based on the state of the gameand add some more mission then its worth it Playing an open ended type of building management game and being done in 2 days is unexcusable really I hope they improve this gameI would wait 6 months If they allow a community of mods then give it a few weeks There just isnt any content to justify the priceHouse Flipper is a fantasticaddictive gamethere are many days when I feel a twinge of guilt cleaning a virtual home while neglecting the home I live in I find it soothing to paint walls and pick up trashplace tiles and pull weedsmow grass and chop down trees There are no time limits and no NPCs to bother me while I play Just mea belt full of toolsand a house to flip 11BSatisfying Cleaning Simulator™BuMultiplayer or Coopu would be sickFor people who loved the buildingcreating part of The Sims but hated the people partthis game is 11  you DIFFICULTY There just needs to be more jobs to dowellmore things to do in general fun game for what it isi just would like to play it more but in order to have that happen there needs to be morelikeGood game Fixes mentally ill braini love this game but you need to add more houses to flipfun game to kill time maybe there should be a career ladder campaign work your way up buying bigger offices  till you have enough money to buy your own hire a team to help you out of diff contracts
1,I wont try to convince youbut let me tell you how my 5th playthrough wentI can eat for a week moneywait for the fighting to die downthen I sneak insteal some of the lootand capture someone to sell

skimmersgiant insects that hide in ambush under the sand They tear us limb from limbthen leave us to diewho then come to feast on us while were alive I get eaten limb from limband eventually bleed to deathnot figuratively Seethis whole time I was playing an unofficial version of the gamedue to my huge skepticism over the whole thing and the awful graphics This extended demo easily convinced me to

trying to figure out what the hell was I supposed to do The UI was uglythe graphics were horridthe learning curve was more like a learning canyon I hated it I put it down and never picked it back up for a monthsbeaten into e pulp and forced back into the cage I think I spent something like 0 hours of game play trying to escape but always got caughtstealing food and hiding it where I could find it easily By then I was pretty good with locksso why not trying to free as many slaves as possible We were discovered of courseso we ran We ran like hell but of the 1 slaves I freed only me and two

full of things to huntfightgroweatkillexplorebuysell and occasionally have a chat within the midst of THE most beautiful and surprising videogame landscape Ive ever seen in thirty years of gaming This is your gamestill eating up way more of my life than can possibly be a good ideaI remember when I first got this gameback in summer of 13 I had started out with nothing but the clothes on my backsome cashand a rusty swordand so I went to the nearest town In a tavern I met a short bald man though we were all bald back then His name was Dirtand this was my new best friend Dirt and I did some pretty bad things thenluring guards to get killed by starving banditsand then stealing all of the gear This changed when we both got a little close one fightand got chased by bandits all the way into the entrance of town There werent enough men to hold them all backso I went into a tavern to see if anyone could help I found a huge mannamed Vedi Vedi was willing to help for a priceand after paying him he went out there with a rusty sword and killed 3 of the bandits before he passed out from blood losseffectively saving the townlong time We killed many a cannibal and a banditand soon enough came upon the idea to make our own outposta safe haven to keep us secure and resupply when the going got tough There was a town nearbyso all we had to do was get a few materials here and there and after a week maybe it would be set By this time all three of us were pretty decked outmyself having a good long coatVedi with a huge cleaverand Dirt with a tricorn hat Most cannibals were either afraid of us by this pointor deadthere wasnt much worry of our safety by nowwith Vedi and I working on some some constructionso it was Dirts turn to go get the materials We had both finished our constructionand so had waited for Dirt to come back A day had gone bywe were starting to get worried By noon the next dayVedi and I had decided to risk it and leave the baseto go see where Dirt had gone The next town over must surely know where he wentlaying on the groundand there were two dead bandits next to him Incisions and cuts were all across his bodybones broken and blood everywhere Vedi criedI stared for a good long timebefore getting his hat and sword I walked to the nearest bandit encampmentwhich some members looked woundedand slaughtered them all with Vediafter he finally caught upand the small base we had thought of originally is now a bustling townwith nearly eight residents thereall dressed and ready to defend their home These people are the best I could have asked forand I still keep the tricorn hat as a symbol of officewith Vedi forgoeing his cleaver for that swordas his symbol of guard captain But as much as I love these peopleand would die for themthey will never be that man whom Vedi and I came to know as our best friendI enslaved the dictator of a nation hell bent on the destruction of all robots Once enslavedI systematically removed his limbs and replaced them with robot

throughAfter a certain African warlord made a video review for this gameI decided to buy it Of the many possible startsthe one where you begin enslaved intrigued me the most SoI created a husbandwife pair and began Heres how that wentstripped of all possessions except for simple pants and shirtand shackled Then they were promptly put to work mining stone After experimenting with the controlsI discovered they could attempt to pick the lock on their shackles Unfortunatelythe guards didnt like that The pair were beaten and put back in cages I decided to wait until nightfall before trying again This timethe two could attempt to pick the locks on their shackles as much as they pleased This was a good thing because they initially sucked at lockpickingthey could reliably unlock both their shackles and their cages Next up was exploring time Nights were then used to scout out the quarry of Rebirth the quarry where they were enslaved to try and find an ideal escape route Sadlythe guards werent idiots Every way in and out of the quarry that didnt require either a billygoats dexterity or mountaineering gear was blocked by a checkpoint with at least three heavily armed guards at all timesand starting to believe I had made a mistakeI began looking through the skills menu to try and find some way out of this Thats when I discovered that the sneak skill also influences how successful you will be at using disguises A plan began to hatch in my mind The next nightI had the dynamic duo of enslaved lovers escape their bonds once more and creep up to the nearest sleeping guard Sure enougha menu appeared when I rightclicked on the dozing sentry that offered the chance toamong other thingsloot or stealth knockout I figured that the victim in question would be far less likely to notice looting if he was unconsciousso I went for the latter optionbrazenly ignoring the 0 success chance What followed was another beating and back into the cages the pair went HoweverI had just found their new nightly hobbythey both improved to the point where they could reliably knock out sleeping guards Once that was accomplishedI would usually have them put their victims into cages before looting themjust in case Apparentlyonce an individual is in a cagethe other guards will automatically treat them as freshly captured slavesEVEN IF THEY WERE DRESSED HEAD TO FOOT IN GUARDSMAN ATTIRE That was mildly amusingbut I was focused on making stockpiles of guard uniforms for future escape attemptsI believed the two were capable enough to risk a true escape attempt I dressed them both in guard uniforms and had them raid every house in the quarry I found barely enough food for one of themlet alone two I decided to take a greater risk and raid the guardhouses Both were instantly caught upon taking the first article of food within the barrack tower and fiercely beatenstrippedand put back in cages I tried several more times before I figured out that a walking character is less likely to wake a sleeping guardsman than a sprinting one EventuallyI believed the two had enough food to get to the nearest town and disappear Checking the mapI noticed that the areas all around the quarry were all named after the deity the guards wouldnt stop preaching about That isall except the region to the north labeled Hidden Forestso I had the pair don their guard uniformsgather their stolen foodstuffsand wait until nightfall by the gate I sent the man through the checkpoint first during a changing of the guard when only three would be on guard instead of five becauseif the worst were to occurhe was the faster sprinter The worst both did and did not occur Only one guard realized I was an imposter and began to chase me For milesand milesand miles Eventually I reached a different biome and this dude was still on my trailoccasionally taking a swing at me with a ridiculously sized sword Eventuallymy character played dead of his own accord and that seemed to work I waited until the guard started walking back to the quarry before applying on the bandages I had stolenI sent the woman through at full sprintthinking to get a head start The guards didnt even bat an eye She even passed the guy who had chased her husband all the way down the mountain and he just calmly let her pass I was shocked and bewilderedbut both emotions were outshone by pure elation After quick look at the HUD 134 days I had escaped Both characters were out of the quarry and not under pursuit After breaking out of countless shackles and cagesafter sneaking around for dozens of nightsafter gathering as many resources as they couldand even after a failed prison riot that went so poorly it isnt even worth mentioning turns out most prisoners either f right off after being freed or refuse to runmy lovely duo were free Malnourishedbeatenand probably lostbut freecontinuing on down the trailthe two discovered what seemed to be an abandoned house full of foodclothingand weapons I had the pair rest and bandage themselvesthen grab as much food as they could carry I examined the other garments but none seemed better than the stolen guard uniforms they wore Once both were fully healed and no longer hungry hunger decreases gradually even after eating I had them set out once again Some of the garments found in the house were labeled as belonging to priests of the nation that had enslaved the husband and wifeso I wasnt too keen on having the two of them stick around and risk recapture after all that work Perhaps it was a waystation for traveling preacherssoon after reaching the part of the map labeled Hidden Forest I was notified of a discovered village IntriguedI had the pair investigate Upon arrival at the villageboth were promptly shot full of arrows by individuals labeled Flotsam Ninjas BewilderedI decided to check the wiki Apparently the newly found faction is comprised mostly of Holy Nation the enslaving one malcontents and fellow escaped slaves Given that my duo were dressed as holy nation guardsI began to see the colossal error I had madeWeird gamedoesnt look gooda bit clunky in all regards500 hours in and countingits magnitudes better than it looksKenshi is a game where you start off feeling smallincapableand alone From the get goyou are basically a nobody just another face in the crowdanother cog in the machineanother meatbag for the grinder  but its not what you arebut what you would rather beand how you get there that makes this game enjoyable The journey to the ultimate destination of your own choosing is where the fun lies Will you be a lone traderlooking to accrue the greatest mountain of wealth the post apocalyptic world has ever seen Or a wandering swordsman who hides their true strength to dispatch armies with relative ease Perhaps a general at the head of your own personal body guard Or the mayor of a little tiny village just beyond the next dune Regardless of what your goal isit is exactly that  yoursthe one thing that first struck me was the graphics Relatively blockyand a bit funny to look at in some casesie buildings clipping in a sand duneor walls built at unreasonable angles ButI dont play a game for graphics to me thats just a secondary benefit What Im after is the gameplayand what I was in store for really put a smile on my faceand figured that Id walk there after exploring this little fortress in the sky Did I mention that the towns are more like fortresses I didnt Wellimagine a town surrounded by walls taller that the highest ingame buildingwith a group of 0 or so very heavily armed and skilled guards for its protection Thats what constitutes a town in Kenshi Relative safetybut Ill get to that in a minuteI noticed that a group of bandits had started charging up the hill at me I thoughtA group of bandits Looks like funlets try out the combat and to my astonishmentI was obliterated Beaten to within an inch of deathbleeding out in the beating sununconscious My stomach had taken massive damageand one of my arms was pretty much useless I had been surroundedbeaten upand left for dead And my assailants Took off to raid the town Luckilythe city guard switfly dispatched thembut I was left on the hill Sofast forward about half an ingame dayand I limp back to town of courseI looted those bandits that attacked me and left ithemi for dead take that After patching myself up sufficientlyI take to luring bandits to town to enjoy the fighting with the guards and levelling myself upspeaking of levelling upskills are sorted into multiple sections dexteritystrengththe various weapon skillsjust to name a few You gain proficiency by performing the tasks You get stronger by carrying heavy objects aroundnot by killing a few rats like some other gamesbut not like theres anything wrong with them You develop your character through hard work and dedication Want to become better at running Take off your heavy equipment and do a few laps Dont know how to swing your weapon Engage a training dummy or another person for all that matters Even your ability to widthstand pain can be increased How By losing Thats rightyou are rewarded for losing Those bandits didnt kill you when they had the chance Sucks to be thembecause now not only are you angrybut youre also more accustomed to the pain The next time you see themthey may well be on the losing side of the fighting Kenshi rewards you for survival and practicemuch like the saying whatever doesnt kill you only makes you strongerI tried luring a group of bandits back to the town only to my surprise  the guards at the gate werent there Either they left on a patrolor were fighting another battle elsewhereI had no time to check The bandits were hot on my tailand the only chance I had of survival was to either lead them away from townor take refuge and hope to escape while they killed all the civilians And in that momentI saw a few brave men  shop guards  rush from the protection of their wallsand stop the bandits in their tracks A bandit or two slipped byand I gave chase Unfortunately while I spent a good while fighting onethe other slayed an innocent civilianand I was happy to see that the population count in the town had actually dropped Protecting the towns actually has an incentive  no population  no trading The bandits dispatchedthe guards returnedand I resigned to head off towards that other town in the distanceas I could see the townit didnt seem far PlusI had enough gold to recruit a new person to my little gang of righteous corpse theives With some new equipmenta little bit of extra knowledge of how the world works and a new companionI set out for the town I travelled for at least two in game days iTwoi I saw the sun riseand setthen rise and set again Such is the scale of Kenshi  the world is an open sandbox quite literally at this point  no grassjust sand and rocksand things that look far off in the distance iarei far off And as I mentioned beforezooming out  I became a speck in the desert The only that that kept my position known was the damn name tag floating above my headbut if you enjoy a bit of realismand quite a bit of freedomit may be worth it Its still early accesswhich means that there are quite a lot of glitchesissuesbugs and crashes I havent encountered anything severe howeveryou may want to pass the game until its more stable and developed decendant comes about What appeals to me the most is actually two things oneyou are rewarded for winningand are rewarded for trying So long as you arent deadthe game isnt over It makes for one heck of a story if you keep little notes about what happens to your character when you play The second thing is the scale and immersion of the game Beyond the glitches sometimes breaking the immersionI actually felt like a lone survivor in a desolate worldwhere people preyed upon the weakand civilization may take days to reach on foot Since I just recently bought the gameI cant say much about the developerexcept that from reading what their vision isit really is a grand one and has a lot of potential Kenshi has lots of potentialbut it also has lots of work left to be done So pass it if youre looking for a more fleshed out gamebut definitely get it if anything in this review has a major appeal to you As for meIll be wandering the desert with my small group of companions trying to make a living in a world where death can come from even a small group of illtrainedillequipped people Afterallyou may know how to fightbut if a knife cuts youyoull still bleedWhen I first loaded up KenshiI thought I had made a mistakebut I didnt realize just how jank the visuals actually were until I saw them  Worsethe game was pushing my aging laptop to the brink of overheatingand the game wasdespite the seemingly lowtech visualsnot running well  The interface was one of the ugliest Id ever seenand was totally obtuse  I had no idea what I was doing or where I was supposed to be going  The games spartan tutorial suggested mining outside of townso I went with that  It was slow  So painfully slow  I increased the game speed and promptly got attacked by about ten bandits with clubs  As the games weakest enemy beat me to a bloody pulpI considered refunding the gamebut the games tutorial brought up another window  I wasnt deadhe had started with a first aid kitand he bandaged his wounds and limped back to the tiny town with only one shop  As he restedI checked his stats to see what went wrong in that fight  His stats were all 1swith the exception of his Toughnesswhich was now a 6  That was just the beginning of my understanding of Kenshithere is no generic pool of Experience that you get that you can just dump in to whatever stat you want  You cant go out and fight bandits for experience and dump the experience points into your mining skill  If you want to get better and miningyou have to mine  You have to mine a lot  The same goes for any skill  If you want to fightmake weaponsgrow cropsor sneak aroundyou have to give your character time to be terrible at it  And once you learn this systemyou can learn how to exploit ithis Martial Arts skills are going up too  If he beats youhell head of the hills and youll be starting from scratch with a new sparring partnerand you wont get better fighting an unskilled opponentpick up said friend and carry him around  Walk back and forth in town for as long as you want  Your character actually bulks up visually as you gain strengthyou dont have to learn to fight if you dont want to  Why not build a base in the Holy Nationand start farming  You can make tons of money cooking advanced foods and selling to the surrounding towns  You can do this forever if you want  Youll have to fight or flee from the occaisional animal or bandit attackand youll have to deal with Prayer Day the best day  Dont like Prayer Day  Feel free to go live somewhere else more dangerous  Each area has its own features and hazardsfrom rampaging slavers to acid rain and giant dinosaur death machines  You can look up each area onlinebut in my opinionlearning where you should and shouldnt go from experience is a huge part of the funevery statpointevery brick that made up his shoddy looking base was earned  The game didnt magically dump them on me in some plot event or through some levelup perk  He trainedhe laboredhe scavengedhe seized opportunities  He started his own faction and they ran from danger until they got tired of runningand built an impregnable fortress a few hundred yards from the starting townand barely scratched the surface of the gamemods  A Dark Mode interface mod to make the UI easier to look at  A graphics mod to reduce ground clutter for my ancient laptopimproving performance several times over  You can get mods that change the way the world behavesadd new weapons and itemsand even new locations to explorebut just remember that like your character in the gameyou have to play by its rules to enjoy it  If you cant get past the graphics or the cumbersome interfacegive this one a pass  If you want a power fantasy where your character can take on an armywellyou can get therebut its a grind  If you want a sandbox that rewards experimentation and exploitation of the gameworld and the rulesthis is your game  Just remember that it can take awhile to get used toSome kind of African warlord on youtube recommended me this game I wasnt let down How about that A game reviewer actually making me want to buy a game and not the other way aroundI decided to start out as a onearmed naked man in the middle of a desert Found the nearest towntried stealing some clothes Got tossed in prisontried stealing clothes again Got tossed in prison againwas sold into slavery Forced to work in rock mineIusing the high lockpicking skill I had acquired from being in cages for daysproceeded to free 10 other slaves from their shackles and attempt an escape In other wordsI used the 10 other slaves as a distraction for the guards while I ran for my life Once the guards had stopped chasing meI started heading towards another town Managed to find some clothes on a dead body outside the town to hide my slavelike appearance Began putting my mining skills to use gathering copper outside of the town Began building my funds while waiting for my slavehood status to be forgottenI stumbled into someone whose wife had been taken by the same slavers who had captured me He decided to join me so we can eventually wipe out the slaver scum My slave status expires I realize that I have a decently large bounty on my headand have my newfound companion turn me into the authorities for the bounty I then break out of prison and hide away in a small shack I had purchased within the townand I acquire a dog and a weird llamalike creature for carrying cargo Once I finish packing supplies to make a trek across the wildernessI have my companion carry me out of the city so the guards dont notice me We then make our way across the vast desertnarrowly escaping death by weird buglike creatures and capture by slaversand build a shack in a decent location to start our own town of sortsthe tax men show up looking for money I spent all my money on my escape They say I have 3 days to payor there will be trouble I am now panic mining copper with my buddy while mehimour dogand our llama starve to death Need to make a trek to the closest town to sell the copper before the tax men come for me Please send helpMy first experience of Kenshi I spawned in the desert town of ShoBattaia thousand credits to my namea few rags for clothes and a pocket full of marijuana My name is Eddie The randomise button on the character creation screen had randomised me into a dishevelled version of formula ones Eddie Jordan so my name was set ShoBattai looks like something out of Mad Max  Post apocalyptic types wander around going about their businessa guy casually walks past with a body slung over his shoulder etc I make my way toward the nearest public toilet Its a small shack made from poor quality wood and corrugated iron sheets but an NPC beats me to it He sits there smugly with the door open taking a dump I decide to wait for him but hes obviously enjoying himself or skiving from work because he takes ages I give up and leaveso I head there The bar is pretty busy with various shady characters sat about I hover my mouse cursor over the most interesting looking ones and it changes to a speech bubble as it graces the head of a particularly dodgy looking bloke I saunter over and awkwardly start a conversation Turns out hes a fence and hes pretty open about it I wasnt planning to be a thief but its good to know where the local buyer of knock off goods hangs out Making my way to the bar I have a look at what they have to offer They sell various alcoholic beverages as well as an appetising sounding food called nutrition block In the end I purchase myself a water jug and a few rations of dried meat because thats what I would have done IRL I check out a few more vendors in town Theres a guy who specialises in crossbows another in swords and a general store It dawns on me that im poor as I see rusty s
1,Wassup KOGI mean players Concerns that if not fixedwill make you lose your player baseenjoyso when they release new characters you wantyou will be forced to use VP to buy more character slotsmaking the game phase much much slower and a lot harder in the processthe same idea with the forgedungeon pets dont really give MP anymoreonly Gatcha ones I guess Why So you buy VP of course 😉30and 40 to 040and 60 Why So you buy VP missions1000 VP to reset 1 skillbut 100 VP to reset the whole skill tree Who is going to buy the 1000 VP one Nice try KOGnice tryit says finish Partusay Champion mode  timesbut it really doesnt need to be in CMetcso youll buy more VPaccessoryand weapon anymore Its all together Why So you dont have the option to choose what you want and have less luck getting the things you want000 GP or coins in the Heroic Shop Nowthe only way is thru 1000 attendance points  days orof coursethrough VPplayers can only play up to Ascencion Thanatos It feels like an early access game although its a game released a decade ago with only 4 starting charactersbut I think I got my message acrossKOG ripping people off harder this time than its first releasepeople know when theyre being ripped offdo yourself a favorand learn from your past mistakessadlythey dont get the point People love the game due to private servers owners who also loveespecially for those communities who really love the game and not just helping them at all coz youre only after peoples moneyWPiDont let this nostalgia hit distract you of KoGs track record And with that out of the waya little piece of my mind before talking about the current standing of the gamegame constantly updating and it was a novelty back then Up to the point of around 010 the game had started to age poorly with higher tech and higher polish games appearing along the wayGrandChase really didnt make much of a success as in BrazilSouth America One of the main cash cows KoG hadthey chose to cut costs and started to focus their development on Elswordour local publisher even offered to buy GrandChases rights to keep offering service and maybe even continue its development back thenincreasing dissatisfaction of the games system and how KoG doesnt seem to care much about FPs around there with KurtzPel flopping as hard as it could and having the same issues with FPits safe to have an educated opinion on how this will just be a cash grab for those who are feeling nostalgic about this poorly aged nostalgic blast from the past that people used to play while in middle school and the only other contenders really were mostly other kind of games MMORPGs like Perfect WorldRagnarok Onlineetc especially for the folks here in Braziland it definitely was when I played it back then The thing is It has aged veryvery poorly and KoG reallyreally does not have a good track record of listening to players and making changes that actually matter and arent controversial Dont get me wrongthere will always be people complaining about updates or lack thereof But reallyif they follow what theyve been doing in Elswordit has the same snapshot it had before the servers were closed Polished for higher resolutions and minimal technical fixesthe game stands almost exactly the same as it was before Very few things were touchedchanged even from the Beta to the launch itselfa lot of the same old bugs are in the game most of them are harmless while a few others are easily used to exploit fights whether in PvE or PvP It seems to be that KoG is around trying to punish players who deliberately abuse of those instead of fixing legacy codewhich honestly is a daunting task to do without remaking the spaghetti that keeps this game togetherliterally ask anyone who has worked with legacy code Its a slow and costly process and KoG would most likely not be inclined to do soseparate inventoriesstarting to ask for money for extra character slots Pets being locked for each characterthe refining system itselfthe new rewards system and set bonuses that will get you a huge advantagethe drop system that was changed four times on the games history as far as I can remember so you dont even have the GP Gold Points armor and weapons in the store anymoreyou need to grind the hell out of it and it isnt even guaranteed for your character with the current system Of course you have the dailyhourly challenge to eventually buy Phoenix set but whos gonna do that after theyre near level 8and want to make sure to have a 10 weapon for PvPrightas the way the game was worked out is inheretly flawed Systems such as the Beserk Elesis counters to projectiles or MP Beserk Arme counters to projectiles are just a way of saying hey Ive tried making projectiles less unfair for others in PvP but it didnt work much haha sorry I dont wanna change how those characters work That would be a problem to keep as is and would be a problem to change them because people would complainso KoG chose the former and not spend a single dime on actually balancing a bunch of stuff for PvPreallythe most popular ones JhinAzimRyan on his 4th classand anyone who has better input handling than someone thats god awful at it One good example would be trying to do anything with Lires first class compared to those mentioned because of the very clunky and weird action system hellliterally play Elsword for a couple hours and try playing GrandChase again You will notice the huge differencethere are no input buffers and you will need to get the timing down of combos and cancels as best as you can This could be used as ahso you just need to get goodright Wellyessort of If you really know how to playit will easily shine through but the chances of you being mistaken for those who are macroing is veryvery high because of the tight inputs you really need to do to actually do something that isnt a 3second animation lockI have mentioned Lire and Arme a few times here and good luck trying to PvP with them Their normal movement and combo kit is so piss poor that they resort to cheap skills most of times Armes MP1 Petrify is a good exemple and culturally South AmericaBrazil you WILL be kicked out of the PvP lobby as soon as you switch to those charactersgood luck getting your weapons up to the refining grade you want because you will need either a lot of patience or a lot of moneywithout the proper information on how your character works You will most likely be flattened down by enemies who have almost all times poorlydesigned cheap tatics to kill you One time favorite of KoGs is to spam super armor frames on almost all attacksfill the room with those monsters and call it a day Another one is big AoEsanything that can stunlock you or CC you out or your mind You better get that Mari LaGeas 4th class going and a whole bag full of potions to clear some content if youre not geared enough for itwhich is an easy way to pad and proxy people to come back to their game as if it was a wow its a launch of a new character Meanwhile some people in the beta glitched and could create characters that werent the first intended threewhich is enough to say that they do have the characters in the game alreadyits just really timegated under their own roadmapif its even fair to call it thatI feel its again safe to say that we all just really wished for a GrandChase  Elswords combo system but better and all the old characters and story we love but we got none of that Just pretty much a private server thats being oficially hosted by the developer itself Helleven the private servers that were around had a lot better balancing and actual care put into the damn gamethere are a few outcomesbasically to be able to say it isnt in maintenance modewith KoG just cashing out on it and letting a few serversGrandChase is real and Elsword is deadGame keeps crashing like back in the good old days 1010Black Desert Genshin Impact what do you mean anon Its year 008 Open your pc and lets grind for our thanatos setThe game is fundont get me wrong It just has the wrong developerslike unlocking all skill trees for FP playersbut with their good steps forward comes their self destructive steps backwardsfor the most partFPs can rival PW with balanced PvPa system that gives you permanent stats across all characters for progressing with other characters is a nice addition and gives some reason to try someone new90 of the characters have been temporarily removed for rebalancingtwo of the games continents for PvE are missingcertain features from the original release are missingpopping visuals of beforethere were no celebratory events to coincide with the launch like most gamesmeaning the developers may have a harder time implementing any new contentbut only time will tellgame goes from

its former selfthe PvE is probably going to be the most enjoyable aspectbut a bad company reputation sort of overshadows this games fate They didnt have to bring this game backbut they didregardless the game still needs a lot of work if its going to live up to players expectationsand KoG Please remove the Megaphone system Its only being used to promote hacks and twitch streamsit is no longer the endearing global chat system it was back in the day Not that youll hear thisit is rather unlikelyAdd 6h from the betaeverything good changed and everything bad keptarmor cant be bought with game currencyGPyou cant quickswitch charactersturned off chat still pingsthe menu is somehow worse than it was 10 years agoand so onsome of the worst parts of the game stayed for some reason Limited PER

inventoryGACHA Nojust stop Stop trying to wring out money from nostalgia At least work for it and deliver a decent producti cant recommend the game AT ALL Youre more likely to be disappointed than relive happy times The company DOES NOT CARE about you or the gameEdit Each update just makes the game worse and worse WL hours changed Fuck Kog seriouslyvery sadugly fonts and misaligned boxes3 bar skills do very little damage and you cant buy MP potions with GP anymore to use lots of skillsno MP potionsno dodgeawful skillsand bad monster balancingthe game is extremely hard late gameso when they release new characters you wantyou will be forced to use VP to buy more character slots30 and 40 to 040 and 60 Why So you buy VP missions1000 VP to reset 1 skillbut 100 VP to reset the whole skill tree Who is going to buy the 1000 VP onend part of the 3rd job says complete The Crucible  timesbut really the mission is to complete Kamikis Castle  timeseven GC club is not shared across characters If you get a gacha pet it can only be used on one character too Why So you buy more VP to get more inventory slotswarehouse slotsGC clubsthe same gacha etcaccessory and weapon anymore Its all together Why So you dont have the option to choose what you wantand have less luck getting the things you want000 GP Now the only way is 1000 attendance points  days or VPbut its a clear cash grab Everything has been redesigned in a way to make you pay more money Please dont spend Overall one of the worst rereleases in historySaveGrandChasethe Brazilian Grand Chase community would like toas the largest player base in Grand Chaserequest improvements and positioning in relation to recent attitudes and current issuesand include a ping meter during matchesto better visualize the connectionadopting a policy of greater transparency towards the communitysuch as character classesitemschallenges dungeonseventsmissionsgraphics improvement of missions and characters and continuity of the story within Grand Chase Classicincluding an increase in the max level limit of charactersas we practically filled up 10 servers at the games launch We really want to support Grand Chase and KOG in this comebackbut its been extremely difficult under current conditionsOh boy where do we startwhile it holds a small spot in my heart ill hold off to nostalgia and try to talk about its problems Expect a wall of text deetailing issues and what i a veteran player think of the current state of the gamelike mission screen where new animated characters can be seenGranted  Half of that is dedicated to SAmerica and rest is finely split between Asia and NAmericamaking simple task of adding a friend needlessly hardGame crashescant join serversthe game has few keys for items hardcoded meaning if you put a potion in same spot and try to quickly use your skillIT will drink you potion and you cant change thisthe in game art is lowres and not updatedtheir Jobs class changes still dont have Extra skillsmeaning you will mostly stick to your first job as its one you can customize mostand even tho this is the case there are QUESTS that force you to use certain skills that you may not even have in order to finish themyou cant buy weapons and armornor can you buy the important items such as Champion Tickets like you used to witch are used to play in champion versions of missions where most people farmed for itemspets and gear They are limited reward from a mission like 3 of them and in order to finish some quests for your characters promotionYOU NEED to play in champion mode like 6 timesdo you see the problembut you cant have all the skills so you will have to gamble before you know what to build the game does have a Practice mode you can access to test all those skillsbut its only for pvp modeand skills work differently on monsters For example Poison arrow in pvp stops Mp Regen In pve it does MINORTiny amount of dmg over timei had to gamble and spend my skillpoints before i realized its a bad skill and i just wasted SP so you will still be in the darkdont worrythe connectivity is a mess and you will crash half the time as you enter the combatyou no longer have One large inventory that you expand as you play the game and where all your resources are stashedrather each character has its own inventory  and any items or rare materials you find will be stuck with that character Ofcourse Warehouse is still a thing and you can move items thereBut Again most items Like actual PetsRare materialsSome weapons and armors and TrinketsAccessories and items are unable to be moved to Warehousemaking it virtually uselesssome of you might remember thatyou could grow fruits and power up trough various buffsThat has been scrappedand you will need that glory because Cruicible and other hero dungeons are unbeatable Game claims that levels 4080 can combat it but iv been in there multiple times with lvl 60 parties and you can fight normal enemies fine but the boss will wipe out your party in a moment On old exploit i remember was running the dungeon naked with only a weaponit made enemies easier to deal withthat has been fixedeffectively nerfing players ability to fight and gain even ground while making the dungeon near impossible And this lack of balance extends to rest of the dungeons as wellseeing that you can buy various crafting items and armors with actuall moneyand issue is that even if you are a pay to win you will struggle because the expensive crafting items you get to boost the power if your weapons still have a chance to failand in this kind of gamethat can DESTROY echanting stones and waste all your money If im PAYING for something it should never be a Maybe If i give you money i should get the item i want Free to plays can only upgrade up to a limit before the game gives them a ¯\ツ¯𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐛𝐮𝐠𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐡𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐛With very small changes and a lot of content cut The game was grindy before but but its far worse due to lack of shared inventorymissions and unique quests being locked to higher levels and behind extreamly dificult challanges While i can understand Clasic aspect of it a reason to keep things like they werethey still found ways to do very little while taking away so muchi am also nostalgic for the game and i have played it for 3 days nowgiving it an honest shot and trying to document changes and see what is differentthis is 01these style of games have long since been outdated and there is a good reason nobody uses that anymore While the game is nostalgic gateway to those old timesit still has issues that it had even back thenand i fear it wont survive this climate if it doesnt adapt and modernizeand if this poorbuggyunbalanceduncustomizable and overblown launch is any indication of how KOG treats their gameit will quickly fail like it did so many years ago And this saddens meactually introducing proper content and pushing the game beyond what it once wasBut knowing KOGs reputationseeing their past actions and seeing how underwhelming and poor this release was i dont have high hopeseither way ill hope for the bestprepare for the worstPretty dogsht game if Im honestwhich would be ok if this game wasnt dead on arrivalbut if I get a Boss CrestPet Manualor a Sealbreaker petI can only bind it to ONE of my characters There is nothing worth purchasing in the GP shop because you cant buy any armor sets or weapons anymore Pray to the mercy of RNG that the dungeon gives you an upgrade and since there is no good reroll system because the property scrolls are cash only AND random resets meaning you cant pick which substats you getyou will most likely be stuck with useless armor Its a very similar notion to artifact farming in Genshin Impact Potions are ridiculously expensive You can easily spend millions of GP on them and youll probably have to because everything hits way harder than it used to No current way to purchase Champion Mode tickets because for some damn reasonthey cost VP now Why would you gate harder content behind points or real life currency Are you dumb bSirius Whats next Sellion without the characters people like to play is honestly a spit in everyones face Its not even the good kind of Sealbreaker sets either because its just skins with stats when they used to be Relic Armor sets The only thing going for this system is that you cant get dupes like you can in Elsword with Ice Burnerswhich isnt an incredibly high bar Think our expectations for you were lowbut HOLY FCK Ohand remember how the old Sealbreaker Armor sets had some sort of pity system where you spend a certain amount to get the entire set Yeahno This coordi gacha version is a straight up zero pity system Ive heard people varying from spending 10300 USD for ONE set 10 being more expensive than Ive ever paid for a lv 80 Sealbreaker Armor set in old GrandChase before they changed all of the sets to purely skins with stats WAY too expensive for what it is If I wanted to play a money sink gamecatch me on Genshin Impactyoull realize that your time is better spent playing Toontown Rewritten Drop the copium heres a personal fck you to KoGIve played additional hours since my last review to test out the new patchmaking you miss most of the damage in her laser beam A lot of her 3MP moves are weakerincluding both support and fighting If you want a support who does damageplay Alchemist YesAmy is THAT badanother popular Sealbreaker Gacha setOrdo Squad I hear Sellions coming out next Yall are that desperate for moneyhuh Maybe instead of releasing skins you have to pay 160 USD foryou should focus on bug fixesQOL patchesand perhaps fundamental game design changes The reason I stopped playing GC was because your account went from feeling cohesive to dividedgiving all of your characters their own inventory and progress in the world Anything you got with your own money could now only be used for one of your characters On top of thatall the cash items you spent were immediately powercrept by the new system Its one thing to piss off your FP players but when you piss off your whales and they leavethe game no longer gets the funding it needs to keep running KOGyou seem to be headed in the same direction as you were in years prior Please explain to me why most of the player base would even feel attracted to spend 160 on skins I would gladly shell out 160 per character if it meant I got armor that lasted me through endgamethey are selling Single Property reset scrolls where you can spend a whopping 8K points to pick 1 stat to reroll of your choosing on any item you want Relic Armor if memory serves me righthave 4 stats Imagine spending  per equip at worst if all your rolls are sht Youre spending 00  whatever  for Sealbreaker you buy because only tryhards would minmax the game in its current awful statenot a single person joined any of my rooms This game is truly dead Shame theyve nerfed characters for teamplay aspect but NOBODY is even online to playI b went back for the Nostalgia bbut bI was left with Disappointment bwhen I would come back from schoolthe first thing was to turn on my noisy PC and spending the rest of my evening playing with my friendseither doing the same mission over and overor getting my ass kicked on PvPIt built a nice memory Despite being almost the same game as beforeit didn’t reach my expectations with this relaunchnot because of the mechanicsbut a few things that I’ll get in depth through this review…but here we arewith a greed releaselooking like the only goal is to milk this game until the last drop leftthey didn’t change anythingand it’s bad Nothing seems to work as it shouldnoticeable delayeasy to develop cheats and filled with bugs that even raised a movement called SaveGrandChaseremoving the armor and weapons with ingame currencylimiting your inventory space behind a paywallgiving advantage with Cash equipmentand not implementing Regional Pricing for Brazil If you are not willing to payyour progression will get severely affectedmaking you play absurd amount of time for the same reward… b A shameless Cash grab by Kog byou are able to level every 1 or  missions you playbut by the time you reach level 60 and preparing to get 4th classmight take you days to get itwith just a lot of repetitionforcing you to play the same mission so many times Imagine the same scenario with every characterit’s frustrating getting so much delay for a PvP matchnot only to fall against cheaters from time to timeand Cashers have a real good advantage with this systemall these issues didn’t make me miss PvP at allbut once againI feel like I’m witnessing the death of Grand Chaseonly for Kog to earn all the money they can The game also leaves much space for toxicitymoderation is completely abandoned here in Brazilpeople can advertise their cheats or even be racist without any consequencesnot to mention the largest player basedo not have Regional Pricing…it was fun but also a frustrating experience I really tried to get investedbut without my friends and so many issuesI just don’t find the will to play with more than one characterbeing most of them lockedto be released over time b All things consideredb I’ll not recommend this game to new playersjust for people that seek to fulfill their Nostalgia as I didyou will definitely have a few good momentsGrand Chase still the same as beforeStep 1 Take a finished gameThere is nothing classic about thisthey have just time gated the content they had already releasedthey DO NOT listen to community feedback They have given us no possible way of voicing our concerns and there are no in game GMs like the old daysgive it nothingIm not your cow anymore that you can always milk Stop this fking milking and just bring the whole system and everything from the old one In this state you just ruined your own fking game AGAIN welp not surprised because its KOG LMAOyou never learn have you Trust me if you just still doing this shtthis game is gonna dead for sure this timebut the DeveloperPublisher is born to be AH0IEits not even 1 month yet but the game is already dead Congratulation KOG keep doing b1tchng on money kay I swear you are the worst online game developer and publisher of all timePeople are giving Positive reviews because they are afraid that KOG will close the game againdespite knowing all the absurd flawsinstead of criticising so KOG makes the game better and more people keep playingthey prefer to defend and attack the playersafterwards when no ones playing and KOG without understanding why no ones playing they will just close the game againlike the menus are really clunkythe UI is really outdated and impracticaland its worse than ever nowits the individual inventoryand individual pets and collectionspecially the pet partbecause the decent ones are REALLY expensive and they are a pain to lvland now you just have to get 0 of each you like instead of one like it was before they killed the game its the same for a tons of other items that before you just game to every character you ownedand now its waaaay more expensive to upgrade itthey actually made it worse than the first individual invetory somehow01 and they are randomizing the loot that already has a really low drop ratethat became really outdated with the passing of the years  Its the same insanely fun game that it was back thenThe game is amazing but I will always hate this damn companyfirst because of their stupid attitude of closing the game to focus on that shit called elswordand now because I lost my youtube channel with a lot of good memories of grand chase because of copyrights of this cursed developers dumbasses that cant even hug the public that loves the game and wanted to keep alive in videos to always be rememberednow I know how cancer this company isI wont spend a cent with this grand chase unless they sell this beautiful game and probably the unique thing that they did great in life to a company which cares for the players and community in general Long live the chase and short live the cancers who closed the game and stroke the youtube channelsGrand Chase is one of my favorite gamesIve played ElswordKurtzpeland Grand Chase Dimensional Chasers the mobile game and Ive had many great memories made along the waya rerelease of the original gameand let me just sayb this release is an insult to the Grand Chase community bwe were already forced to deal with what would be only the start of a seemingly endless supply bugsglitchesneglectgreedand overall poor designmanagement choicesmyself includedwere unable to access the game for approximately 3 hours after the initial release due http errorsand a Korean error message that read The connection to the login server failed Exit the program Once I finally managed to open the gameI was only able to make it as far as the server listas KOG was severely unprepared for the plethora of players roughly 7000 that were trying to play their game There were very few seversall of which were fullbut plenty of other games have had similar issues on launchand I can understand why companies would prefer to see how many players they will have i before i spending the money to upgradeadd more servers to their gameI was finally able to make it into the actual game and create a characterwhich is when I learned that there are only four characters in the game ElesisLireArmeand Lass KOG stated that they plan on adding the other characters in future updates in order of original release For most of uswho are returning playersit is in my opinion a bad choice to not allow us access to most of the characters who we either mainedor simply enjoyed playing and switching between This choice is especially weird considering I would later find out that you can still get gear for characters that arent in the game yet I can only imagine how long the process will be for all of the characters to be rereleasedmade a characterand began playing the game During my time playingI experienced great amounts of lagfreezinghaving my cursor turn invisiblegame crashesinability to turn in questsinfinite loading screensteleporting enemiesinvisible enemiesbeing kicked out to the server menuand much more It should also be noted that none of the maps have any difficulty after Normal besides Championof which you are unable to purchase champion tickets for in order to access unless you want to spend real moneywhereas you were able to purchase champion tickets in the old game for 00000 GP each in the GP shopat least for English speakersas there are four main audience types South American and Asian the majorityNorth American and European Some things are just straight up untranslated and in Koreanwhereas a lot of other things are in broken English Interestingly howeverdespite most of their audience being from South AmericaIve seen a lot of people complain about VP a currency bought with real money pricing not displaying in South American currency for South American playersI also noticed that almost nothing is shared between them Inventorygoldpetsand even GC ClubPremium GC Club are not shared Each character is almost like their own accountwith the exception of certain items that can be put in the warehouse and transferred between charactersand VPnone of them have any skill trees beyond their 1st jobs skill treeand even then it feels as if the 1st jobs skill trees are missing some skills although I could just be remembering incorrectly All of the jobs beyond the 1st only have their base skillstheir ultimate skill if you unlock itand the shared skills between all jobs This means that despite there only being four characters to playthey are all missing the majority of their skills and passives despite the fact that you can unlock all of their jobs Players also now only have 1 life in dungeons as opposed to 3 There was a time where we only had 1 lifebut this was due to the addition of a dodge skill that was implemented into most characters skill treeswhich is not currently present despite the fact that we only have 1 lifethat most if not all of the bugsproblems that were present in the CBT Closed Beta Test are still in the currently released version of the game The one exception to this seems to be the VP pricing on the items in the Item Mallwhich they actually i raised i from what they were in the CBTthe GP shop is very limited while the VP shop or Item Mall contains exceedingly overpriced items There is also a Seal Breaker Gachawhich on average seems to require about 18000 USD if you want the full setwhich is an unreal amount to spend on something like thatespecially considering that the current Gacha isnt even for an actual set of gearits for a coordicostume set which has fairly low stats and a pet Even the Seal Breakers that we had in the original game for i actual gear i with really good stats didnt cost that muchmeaning that there is a lot of missing content from the gamedespite the fact that you can still level up to 8 This makes it so you can get stuck on a character granted you level them up enoughas there isnt content high enough level for certain quests like the ones where you are required to kill monsters that are within  levels of yourself You also get epic orange gear very easily from doing questsremoving the sense of progression you used to get from farming for good gear in dungeons Even stillyou can be in a full set of epic gear with good property rolls and the enemies in dungeons still feel impossibly tankystrong even though the difficulty is only on Normalwho

1,Got my controller working and the game is SO DAMN GOODclick the cog on the right hand sidebuThis will be completely spoiler freeubI have done most subquests and I wanted to share my thoughts on this game I have also posted this same review on Reddit Many people here in the Steam reviews have barely played the game to give any valid opinions about the gameso here we gomultiple Final Fantasy gamesXenogearsChrono TriggerYs and many others I am not going to compare games or rank them I want to share my thoughts about this game that might be interesting for others whether or not to buy this gamethe very first moment you start this game it was a big wow for me Unreal Engine on a Tales game Everything looks amazingfun battle mechanicsinteresting story to start with Absolutely amazingI think the story was ok It is not great but it is also not bad I think the story definitely had a lot of potentialhowever the second half of the game managed to lower my initial impression on this game I dont want to go into specifics or spoiler territory They had great ideas for the story at the startbut in the end it felt like a missed chance in terms of story writing and execution for meit looks very good Nice looking environments Nice looking skits and anime cutscenes For a Tales gameit is absolutely amazingnot that big of a dealit is very clear where to go and what to do NPCs also have the checkmark above their head to indicate that you have already talked to them before There is the fast travelwaypoint system so you dont have to walk The game really rewards you to do exploration for good gear and items I managed to get some very awesome items by exploring as much as I could in each map The game also has an interesting cooking system that gives a lot of good buffs and a campfire to restore HPCP Fishing was also a fun activity to do while exploring the maps For meexploration was very well doneand it turns out this monster is lv 3which is basically impossible for you to complete right now In my opinion a recommended level would be very much appreciated here Overall the questing is funhas good rewardsbut the system has some flawsespecially in the second half of the game where the monster HP was a lot higher at moderate difficultyI had to look at which monster my party member was attacking and attack the same monster The biggest problem is when the HP pools of certain monsters were very high and they push you against 3 elite monstersand because of the lack of control over your party membersthis made the fights more difficult than it should be Also they could die easily when facing big attacks from bosses If I could at least control that they attack the same monsterthis would have been a much better experience for mefun battle system but just this small thing of having no control will be annoying for many playersespecially at difficulties higher than normaland for me it was not that big of a dealjust a minor thing Howeverthe biggest flaw for meis that at some moments they decide to disable the fast travelso that you have to walk all the way back And of course the big HP pools elites have returneda little bit of advertising on the right side during a campfire was not a big deal to me I did not feel forced to buy any DLCnor did I need DLC to get money in the game The game is perfectly playable without buying ANY DLC Sure there are some people that think it is absolutely unforgivable to have any kind of DLC or advertisementhowever I dont want to have any discussion about this It is as it is I believe for many players it wont be that big of a dealbut if it is for youthen now you know that there are ads and DLC in this gameit would be either a 75 or  depending on my mood and how much weight I place in certain aspects but it has some flaws that diminish the initial first impressionI bought it 25 hours agoand i have 24 hours played Its Goodimagine a AAARPG game in 221 wo game breaking bugsyou can buy Galdboost itemsstraight up level ups etci personally do not care if a game has those buyable options or not HOWEVER when you constantly get it shoved in your face its suuuuper annoyingstart up the game symbol on the main menuleading to yes the steam storeif this would be the only encounter id still be fine with it but it isntrest on bonfires and you have yet another icon with the  symbol trying to get you to buy any of the boosters or outfits or whatnotsoundtrackgraphicsVAscutscenes etc however the MTX ads in the game that remind me more of the hey click this approach of mobile games is horribleshould have kept it in the main menu but keep it out of my actual gameplayGame is goodits no FF7 or Chrono Triggerbut they gotta let it go and realize that 1 thats a pretty high bar to overcome and 2 it took years for people to realize how amazing those stories were and even more years for them to feel nostalgic about I say this as a guy who literally spent hours making FF7 shrinkydinks in middle schoolbut still didnt think it was the best game Ive ever played at the timebut thats just because Im an old man Alsocoincidentallybecause Im an old manIm used to Japan throwing some weird crap at me in their fantastic RPGsyou spoony bardThis review was written after the game was 1 completed and does not contain any heavy storyrelated spoilersso the overall presentation is mindblowingly miles away from its predecessors Im familiar with all PS1 and PC Tales Of titlesalong with recent BANDAI NAMCO action jRPGs like SCARLET NEXUS and CODE VEINso you wont be spoiling yourselfthe game was advertised to have an Atmospheric Shader and I would say that along with image sharpening the results are impressive All areas of the game have respectable backdrops that are often screenshot worthyand this level of quality persists throughout most of the game Previous games suffered badly from the dungeon design cheapnessand that feeling persisted throughout the whole journeythe more mechanics are unlockedso I wouldnt recommend grinding in the same spot Since the mechanics are unlocked graduallythe player gets enough breathing room to practice Each main party member can be controlled at any timeso you can pick your favourite fighting styleneedlessly prolonging the grind Arise does 1° and keeps the battles intensewhile not making progress tedious Ive played the game from the beginning till the end on the highest available NG difficultywhich would be Hard Chaos can be unlocked by the time youre at the end of the storybut sweet If you have a history with the seriesthen youll likely be positively surprisedas the levels of fanservice are rather high I actually liked it more than the final areas of the story Once you finish the storytwo subquests will appear Its the one that is located in the earlier part of the gameand the rewards are worth ittherefore the quests themselves do not feel like a pointless chore for completion looking at you SCARLET NEXUSbut still a gigantic QoL improvement for those that like to perfect their boss battlesbut not too often The soundtrack does fit the general atmosphere of the gamebut after two weeks of not playing the game I could not recall a single melodyexcept the licensed opening theme I hate to admit itbut the main games soundtrack misses the mark of being memorable SCARLET NEXUS was the surprise title of this year that did a better job at having memorable trackssomething that I can call an example of a more old school video game soundtrack approach With all of this in mindI do not dislike Tales of Arises soundtrack and I do find it engaging Some tracks gave me FROM SOFTWARE vibeswith epic orchestral compositions and dramatic chanting It was a grand and unforgettable feeling Favourite track Theme of Ganath HarosI didnt find any particular main cast members that I would specifically like All the characters are quirkyas evident in the skitsbut none of them were charming or memorable enough to switch to them and main themit was a fun and satisfying way of playing the games Ive found out about Arises lack of CoOp particularly lateand I was rather disappointed by such decision I can play Tales Of games solo without any issuesbut the series allowed simultaneous character control ever since the first instalmentand thats one of the franchises signature features Local coop might be a very niche feature in jRPG space to begin withand thats exactly what made these games special I dont believe for a second that it was impossible to make local coop work in Ariseeven with the SCARLET NEXUSesque mechanic of calling your teammates for an attackI know that dying teammates is nothing new in Tales Of gamesbut that doesnt mean that it cant be improved The AI has zero awareness of hazard zones and will stand in a danger zonetrying to perfect dodge through attack instead of just taking one step to avoid it altogether to begin with AI perfect dodges are not guaranteed and are often failedso because of this behaviour battles against a formidable foe are like a coin flip within the same scenario and conditions the party can get wiped out right in the beginning or survive through almost the whole thing When the fights turn uglythe whole combat experience ends up being an AI revival and babysitting simulatortheir level gets bumped uptheir attack have a different element to thembut its still the same thing This has been a thing in the seriesbut it especially stands out in Arise Bosses have variety Weapon designs have some variety Yet here were are whacking recoloured crabsSteam Beta was patched to fix the issuebut for some it still persists To me it looks like the developers tried to have a fancy gamepad support that backfired instead Having regular XInput and DInput at least as a rollback option wouldve prevented these issues altogetherso the overall performance is fair On a GTX 17 at 144pthe maxed out game runs at 6 FPS with dips during heavy alpha transparencies like lots of trees or arte effects right in front of the camerasome settings are stupid resolution scaling can be changed by increments of 5 instead of something reasonable like 5 One thing people might point out is that this game has a rather aggressive level of detail managementso youll likely notice object details popping inhoweverI did cause one in main menu while hooking OBS Studio The game saves frequentlyso progress loss is unlikelyunless you dont do any occasional manual saveswhile also having fun The world is gorgeous and the motion captured animations of the characters really help with the immersion The cast might not be the most distinct in the seriesbut the games skit system is well executed The overall experience makes this one of the best Tales Of titlesId like to see more classic Tales Of games ported to PC and would suggest not to abandon local coop for the future Tales Of titlesThe game itself is amazing so farthis is the state of the game you getI can live with certain parts being a little grindybut i dont accept to miss out on build options just because the publisher decides to cut quite important pieces out of a finished game to sell them separatelyBewarethis game does NOT have coop like the previous Tales gamesIt feels like Im 11 years old playing Tales of Symphonia for the first time in my grandmothers basement all over againWorks almost perfectly in ProtonGreat gamebut it didnt do everything right Stillthis is likely my favorite from this seriescombos and flashy movesweapons and feel unique to playtheres a good amount of grammar errorscompared to the restthat you are forced to play as Alphen till you get a full partythere is a boss fight in secret endgame dungeon where your AI will just keep dying to the boss over and overdoesnt matter what level they are or what gear they useyou will always use those ispecial team movesi to finish off enemiesit could get pretty oldendgame battles can feel daunting Especially if theres 3 different types of enemies you need to break armor for onestop the arte casting of another and stop the dodging of yet another And somehow the devs were unable to make the AI do at least SOME of that So what happens is you target oneuse skilltarget anotheruse skilltarget another bla bla And FINALLY you target the enemy that you want to attack The cycling between each enemy type back and forth is very annoying in this gamebut most of them require you to gather 5 bear assesbut stillless targetingcan wipe all enemieswhile those ispecial team movesi in Arisesometimes dont even kill allbut better side questsA Friend gave me the Game as an Gift and im really thankful he did that Tales of Arise is such an Bang for meThe actual game is pretty okay so farbut until they remove the ads from the camp screenIll be leaving a negative reviewPort Tales of the Abyss to PC you cowardsGreat Game Dont buy the DLCsTales of Arise is probably the best Tales game Ive played thus far but buying the standard edition of the game causes Namco to spit in your facethe experience points used to buy new abilities and improve gameplay mechanics like crit damageperfect dodgesI frames etc These are used in the title systemof which every character has 15 gained through basic gameplay and side quests 1 technically but thats 2 Each title is basically a mini skill tree with a permanent stat boost at the end  SP is painfully slow to gain during regular gameplay and there isnt a way to farm them quicklysome of the things they are used to purchase are basically required for progression and each character needs a total around 355k to unlock everything Quests and Gigant monsters give nearly 25 battles worth but unless SP generation ramps up past the second half of the game I doubt ill be able to unlock everything SP is the only base resource that cant be bought individually in dlc and comes in small amounts in most of the dlcs The exception is the dlc artifact that doubles SP gained from battlebuffsand abilities to completely break the game balance on the hardest difficultyCheck out my full review on this with pics on urlhttpswwwsinicalanimenetworkcomposttalesofarisereview Sinical Anime Networkurlbut I felt this game deserves it as Ive finished getting every achievement now without buying any shortcut DLC perks and maxed out all my endgame weapon stats So lets get down to itwith Renans in control and enslaving the all the Dahnas You get to control a group which consists of both Dahnas and Renans to defeat the five Renan Lords and free all the Dahnas from slaveryespecially since each of them comes from pretty distinctive backgrounds Each of them gets their spotlight to shine and all in all making me actually care about each of the group members Overall I think the story was nicely doneso the default control layout didnt make sense as the attack button was R1the three Artes attacks was trianglesquare and Xand the jumping button was circle It wasnt a problem since I was able to edit them all in the settings I changed the Artes attacks to L1R1and triangle respectivelyregular attacks to squarejumping to X and initiating conversations with circle After thatit felt much better as if Im playing a classic action game during combatthe game is pretty straightforward on progressing through the story Its not as true openworld as I initially thought at firstbut many of the areas are big enough that sometimes I forget that its a narrow path to the next destinationarmorand an accessory You cannot modify your weapons or gear in any way which may be offputting to some You can however customize your accessory by leveling them up to 5 with modified stats via materialseach of them plays rather differently which keeps battles fresh For exampleI find myself controlling Shionne the most during battles as I prefer ranged gun attacks Rinwell would come second as I love casting powerful AOE attacks that just pleasing to look at when the high damage numbers show the animation studio thats behind the ever so popular Demon Slayer and much of the Fate series That alone speaks volumes for itselfeven so that sometimes I found myself just stopped from moving around just so I could listen to the music playingthe second anime op song comes in and that one was a lot more to my liking than the first It has a much more serious tone to itwhich makes the viewers know that the story going forward just got real P  The ending song at the end was also nice and fitting Battle theme is just meh75 for Soundand some of them are nice and expanding some can only be done postgame So I feel thats a plenty amount and can be done at any time No pressure in getting to them before you finish the gameequipmentArtes etc given that you find the appropriate artifacts first Can be done post game if you prefer Nextthis game is pretty linear in a sense An example for that is with some JRPGstheres different romance options or choices that can alter the dialogue and change the outcome of the game like the Persona or Legend of Heroes games Sadly there is no such feature here which to me is a bummer It could have added major replayability value given the amount of party members But the redeeming factor is that this game does have a healthy amount of challenging bosses and with the Chaos difficulty mode that can be unlockedit certainly adds some replay valueas Im now clocking in at over 1 hours now and am willing to write this review  This game can be an entry point for newcomers whove never played another Tales game The story here is self contained The polished visuals that I saw in the trailers in the beginning of the year are what got me to preorder this game months in advance And now that Ive done everything I could ingame I can happily say that it was my money well spentand I can say I very much enjoyed this a lot more than that one completed that game as well For this game I went the extra mile beyond getting all the achievements and spent hours with each character doing solo battles in Training Grounds just to max out their endgame weapons but even I can tell that Bandai Namco has really stepped up their production value with this title compared to all the older onesand I look forward to seeing future installments elevating their boundaries even higherI paid 6 dollars for this gameso why in the ever living should I constantly have my immersion broken by DLC advertisements like its some cheap gacha gameTales of Arise has improved on the series quite a lotbetter modelsimproved animations and detailed expressions The gameplay has been simplified but only for the better and the darker tone of the story is something Ive been looking forward tothey have also added a lot more player agency when it comes to customizing character skills and abilities It definitely feels like the Tales series have entered a new generationessentially putting game content behind a paywallso if you want these skillswhich are really strongyou have to pay up This is an incredibly idiotic decision to put it in the mildest terms possiblethe Tales series has been a big part of my gaming history for over two decades and when they started porting games to PC I was really excited I bought all the PC versions of the game even though I had every console version of the series because I really wanted to support BandaiNamcos decision to open up to the PC market I wont be buying another Tales title as of today unfortunatelyIm just incredibly disappointed If Steam allowed it I would refund the game but I have already spent  hours on it and I didnt find out about the DLC skills until nowPinkhaired ZeldaUnmasked ArtoriasLeona from League of LegendsA Pokemon TrainerTanjiro Kamadoand Ramses II go on an adventure to save the world from House Lannister
1,I like the fact you can use modifications in this game  I only plat v Bots I am 68 so reaction not too quick04 KDh1Prosh1dead aim hipfire mechaniclethal gunplayand a realistic middle eastern settingso you can tell if someone is talking from the other side of a wallshooting from inside a buildingetctheir blood will get sprayed onto the surface and streak down  Armslegsheads depending on the damage the player recievedthey wont always stay attached    Makes everything feel that much more lethalor as a static weapon platform to lock down a lane but youll rarely see them driving around

attacks and different types of air support  But each one is easily countered by simply staying insideshooting it downor putting on a gasmask  Howeverit can still change the pacing of the round enough for the attacking team to move up and gain a better footholdbut otherwise the servers are running at 60 tick which feels very fluid  solid on UE4there will be modding  long term support for this gameb  If youre totally new to the Insurgency franchiseits worth noting that the devs have a long history of providing free content for their games for years  to come  New mapsweaponsgamemodesanimationsetc were all added to Insurgency years after release  The Insurgency that I bought in 2014 is not nearly as cool as the Insurgency that I can open up nowlistwhile others on even lowerend hardware report super smooth gameplay  The devs have stated that optimization is the 1 priorityand while theyve made HUGE improvements from only a month or two agoit could use some more love  But given the long history of this dev team with their other titlestheres no reason to think that this wont be addressed  I think the fact that the game is slated for a console release is a very good thing in this regard because any optimization they perform here on PC should transfer over well to smooth console gameplay  If your PC is stronger than a XBox and it probably isyoull be in good shape for Sandstormlistfaster cores is more important than having a bunch of slower ones  For this reasonmy 4770k from 201 runs this game wellwhile a more recent budget CPU may strugglelonger map loading timesetc  Since SSDs are so common these days I didnt feel like this is a mark against the gameits more of a protiplistHad a guy who was seemingly high making heavily military esque callouts and screaming into his microphone about playing the objective This wasnt salty screamingthis was deep wholehearted passionate screaming This dude wanted to watch the security rise in victory and he was willing to do anything about itEver since I played iInsurgency 2014iI’ve never seen anything quite like it in terms of immersionintense close quarters combatand satisfying gunplay So when I heard there was a sequel in the worksI was interested to see how it turns out And after months of playing the Alpha and Beta phasesthe game is now finally releasedthe HUD is minimalisticand crosshairs are nowhere to be found Firearms are a real threat and a couple of shots are enough to drop the enemies For this reasonthe gunplay is extremely satisfying On top of thatan extensive arsenal of weapons is available to players to choose from CurrentlyiSandstormi offers a Coop mode vs bots and three PvP modes for small and large battleswith more content planned to be added after the launch Other new additions include bigger mapsfire supportand vehiclesand weapons have been modeled with extreme attention to detail Maps are now considerably biggerand the added detail makes them more believable There is a broad range of customizations available for the characters and seldom do they look similar Howevercharacter models look lifelessand their moving animations feel offiSandstormi truly shines The Arabic accent of the Insurgents is superbly done The explosions are deafening and powerful weapon sounds contribute to the enjoyment of gunplay Furthergunshots sound different depending on the shooter’s position iSandstormi is the kind of game that needs to be played with a good pair of headphonesbut it’s still nowhere as smooth as its predecessor Overallits optimization leaves a lot to be desired While the game runs fine most of the timeoccasional hiccups and frame drops are to be expected Moreoverin my time with the gameI’ve witnessed all manners of bugs and glitches Hopefullygiven timemost of these issues will be patchedIt’s not a game for everyone Playing it requires a bit of timepatienceteamwork and strategy and is aimed towards more mature players As a longtime iInsurgencyi fanI was hyped for iSandstormi and the final product does not disappoint I highly recommend checking the game out if you are interested in tactical shootersI have played Insurgency Sandstorm since it came out I have watched the game evolve into what it is today In my opinion is one of the best FPS tactical combat shooters out there of all time If you havent played itI would encourage you to try it In all my years on Steam I have never written a review until now so that should tell you something about this gameh1Insurgency Sandstorm is the Forza Horizon of military shootersh1its not a hardcore simulationlike ARMA or the Gran Turismo games But it also isnt arcade level shenanigans like Battlefield or Need for Speed The game is very high lethalityand high recoil An unmodified gun can kill just as easily as a heavily customized oneand the time to kill is as short as you can get but the action is fastand the controls are responsive To borrow a term from its racing genre brethrenInsurgency sits very comfortably in bsimcadeb territoryI only play coop I have zero interest in the epeen measuring contest that is competitive PvPthose days are long since past circa Day of Defeat Source and CoD4 Modern Warfare So if you want an opinion on the competitive aspect of the gamelook elsewhereI simply dont have an opinion on it That being saidcoop allows for playing with friends or randos in a much more relaxed settingthat can still cause the adrenaline to pump when needed ie being the last one alive while defending the final objectiveyou have a minute plus left to hold the pointand youre outnumbered a dozen to one by the opposing team of respawning botsin which you and up to seven other hapless goons partake in a fight to move across a map by capturing and then maybe defending or destroying various objectiveopposed by a team of respawning bots that always outnumbers you If you dieyou stay dead until your surviving teammates can succeed at the next objectivetriggering a team wide respawn Rinse and repeat until the final objectivewhich needs to be defended for an extended period of time against an unending onslaught Rinse and repeat across various maps until you get bored Thats the Checkpoint game mode in a nutshelland its what I play 999 of the timewith update b110 Operation Exodusba new coop mode called Survival Same as aboveexcept everybody starts out with pistols onlythe order of objectives is randomizedand completing an objective rewards you with a randomly generated primary weapon So if you were ever afraid of the game getting stalethis mode tosses in a lot of RNG to keep things mixed up and feeling fresh Play Checkpoint on a specific map long enoughand youll start to develop a feel for the AI where it usually goes and how itll typically act Survival takes all that accumulated feel and chucks it right out the windowcause youre moving all over the map at random Bots canand willcome at you from all angles with no rhyme or reason It really does keep you on your toeswhile also forcing you to deal with random and sometimes nearly unusable primary weapon configurations to boot Ive tried itstill prefer Checkpoint myselfbut I both get the appeal and think its a smart additionthe weapon selection is pretty greatcontaining the expected rogues gallery of modern and retro firearms You have the always appreciated Cold War era GFALM16AKMup through the more modern offerings like the AUGM4AK74FAMASplus quite a few more and a few new ones added every major update The arsenal also includes some notable pieces of downright archaic hardwaresuch as the WWII era Grease GunGarandWelrodand the Mossin Nagant to name but a few The customization is rather robustwith a wide selection of optics and other hardware attachments on offerwith availability determined by class selection ie only Demolitions get underbarrel launchers with explosive grenadeseveryone else is limited to smoke munitions Each mode has its own amount of supply points to spend on your loadoutand the various weapons and attachments have their own cost in supply So if you want a super tricked out rifle opticssupressorextended magsrecoil gripthe worksyou icani do itbut at the expense to the rest of your kit such as doing without armora secondaryor grenades You want an M4A1 with a 2x holographic sighta masterkey underbarrel shotgundrum magsand a supressor Sureyou can be ithat guyi at the gun range Myself I enjoy a supressed G with ironsightsit gets serious work donebut there is also a server browser and mod support for custom servers I only play the vanilla gamebut even at am and the game listing only 1K people playingI can get into a game in under a minute and usually much quicker than that You get inpick your classyour kit fully customizable loadouts with class restricted equipmentcreate as many different loadouts as you wantand get to work Play aggressivelypush forwardand complete the objectives with your team and be careful not to shoot themfriendly fire is a thingthe Security teams Commander can call in an airstrike from an A10 Thunderbolt II aka Warthog Itll strafe the designated areacomplete with the noticeable delay between the explosive shells hitting the target and the distinctive BRRRRRRTTTTTTT sound of its 0mm GAU8 Avenger rotary cannon being fired It is the best part about playing Commander as Security sorry Assassin and Clericstill love you toothan they are iRacing or Assetto Corsa and thats why I used itIt is alrightmaps and weapons are introducedthe game will improveImagine CounterStrike and Battlefield had that babyand then Rainbow Six  Siege and Day of Defeat had a babyand thenby some miraclethose two babies metfell in love and had a baby of their own This would be the finalultimate baby to rule all other babies Its kinda like thatWent on sale right after the fall of Kabul kekwThe Goodit isnt as brutal as it seemsa lone soldier is very unlikely to be effectiveperhaps even moreso then the visualswhich is sadly a breath of fresh airboth of which are enjoyablebut it is still an area that needs more workmany of which seem to have been addressed but some seem to still persist Not of the game breaking variety but present and a negative all the samebut even still more could be done to differentiate maps visuallythat and the animations of others is sub par compared to the rest of the package I dont think it is a deal breakerbut it is one of the weaker elements which I would very much so like to see improvedPeople yell at me and said im black in the close proxemity chat  Good gamer sense because im black for real 1010awesome game one of the best realistic FPS games i could find  the addition of night operations would be greatfinally played the night maps and loving itCOD and Battlefield doesnt compare to this gameProbably the closest to realistic as it can get The sounds are amazing as well gameplay is extremely dificult though Would definately recommend this gamevery fun i was killed by a man called mollymage and he only uses molotovs and after that game everybody in the game started using molotovs and the whole map was on fire SoI’ve been playing the game for at least 10 monthslogged in a good amount of hours on it and mastered a good majority of its mechanicsit’s definitely something that I am proud to say I play and play oftenand a game I’m passionate in supporting Which is something that a lot of the games that’ve recently release haven’t done I consistently come back to this gameevery day or other day because a large portion of the matches i play ne’er truly feel the same It’s a nice game to sink into and spend an hour or two onand I think one of the best features about this game Everything from bullet cases making different noises on surfaces to the difference in subsonic and sonic ammunition brings a whole level of immersion not a lot of other games do for me ESPECIALLY the voice actingit’s absolutely top tier Bravo Zulu across the board for the VA’sand end in seconds Guns react appropriately and recoil is manageable yet unique to each gun Requiring you to get a good feel for the pattern of each firearmwhich I’ve done and proved to worklike explosions going through roofsfloors or walls and killing you The occasional 180 Mosin man flick shots from across the map the second you spawn Broken cosmeticsthe game itself if fun A load of funat least for me personallyso much so I’ve bought the game full price for  friends just they could join me And it probably won’t be the last time I do eitheryoull see more combat than the afghan national armyThe player lying down with an M249 for 10 minutesI hope you have a wonderful dayI was a dedicated Ambush playerbut they didnt include itbut they removed itbut they neglect it  then remove it2021 UPDATE  Since my original review early in 2019 I have been playing Sandstorm on and off  I also realise that I could have made it clearer at the time that my review was based on coop game play and not pvp  I had my fill of pvp games many years ago and coop is what I prefer nowadaysGTX10606GB and 16GB Vengeance 000mhzbut I must make it perfectly clear that I have no issues with frame rates and performance other than in PVP where there certainly is an issue or two with lagplease remember the following…………this game is hardbut easily the best in terms of creating a feeling of reward and satisfaction to the player  Every bullet can kill  Once you get that and realise that you cannot run and gun this game like your average arcade shooter COD or BF then you start to see the beauty I am referring tothen THIS is the game for younoone cares how many kills you have I really mean that  If you want to  impress then start playing the game the way it was meant to be played……RULE 1  always play the objective  RULE 2  you are not John Rambo RULE   you are great only if you as a team not glory hunterswho end up dead most the time succeed in winning a roundnot because of your own KD  Again I cannot stress of how little importance KD is in this game  Look at the leader board when you are playingmore often than not high kills amount to nothing in terms of personal gain XP  You want XP  Then capture that objective and hold it as potentially the last man in the team to be a hero  That is how you make friends in Sandstormbut you knowthis is New World we are dealing with  If you knew anything about them then you would know that like the first one this game is going to be an epic masterpiecethat is EPIC
1,6 hour story mode which includes  and a half hour of zenitsu cryingThe Hinokami Chronicles is a solid fighter but has some downsides Gameplay and mechanics are very good and easy to understand Anyone can easily pick it up and jump in Story mode is a abridged retaling of the first season and movie from the anime It has cutscenes with plenty of boss fights Story mode  is where you can unlock characters and costumes Story mode has 8 chapters and can be finished in 8 to 0 hours While story mode can be fun for the most partit has parts that absolutely drag In many instances you are free to explore the map You can complete small challenges for rewards but other than that its pretty dead Often you will find yourself walking in a straight line doing nothing and no way to speed it up i assume this is to extend the length of the game but doesnt mean its funlight and heavy attack Each character has their special moves which is their breathing techniques You chain your attacks and techniques to max out your damage You have a gauge which when filled can allow you to boost and increase your attributes or perform your Ultimate Art For the most part characters feel unique enoughmusic tracks and profile pictures which isnt really enough of an incentive except for the sake of collecting them all There is no arcade mode which could have really gave it more replay ability Also there is hardly any costumes to speak of Costumes could easily give more content Even a more customization option can really make your character pop out moreShinobu is so fine on godUMAIOverpriced for what it is Good gamebut just wait for a sale Not worth the money comparing it to other new release games coming outsuch as Forza and battlefield 202 It feels likeat timesyou are just paying money to watch a watereddown version of the anime PVP is excellentalthough there is a lack of it in the core campaignand you will spend more time if you choose to collecting the small items on the semiopen world levels What you are getting from this is a PVP game with an anime Im hoping they add more content soon for people that would rather play the campaign or enjoy the campaign more Still a beautiful game but not worth the price in any way whatsoevergood game but not worth 60 dollarsthis game taught me how to breathe with a swordShinobu Supremacybreathing is funGreat Gamebut God damnAkaza ate my ass sideways between two pieces of rye and toasted me for 0 minutesyesThis game shouldnt have been released yet Its clearly unfinished They only launched it already cuz season 2 is coming and they want to put it as DLC so it feels like a cashgrab and I dont usually say thatbut I just cant like it when I look at the bigger pitcurehere are some reasons whyand I hope it willbut for now the game isnt worth 60€its barely worth 0€ I say it looks like a beta version based on how it looks and some other reasons which I will explain as wellfor exampleyou cant cancel your attacks by guarding making it feel like its a mashing gamegetting the heavy attack feels way harder then it should beit can be overall improved for sure and I hope it will But it isnt badit definitely has some interesting mechanicshowever the free roam  is just stale and not fun at allyou walk around catching stuff and the space you walk on is very limitedyou cant even jump or do any other actionyou just walk cant even call it run cuz its so slowbut it does not have 60fps optimizationwhich just reinforces my point earlierits not finished It always runs at 30fps andin my opinionthat is really stupidits 202new games shouldnt really even be realeased without 60fpsI really hope they add many more charactersbecause currently it has 8 character and 7 of them are variationsreskins If they waited for season 2there wouldve been a lot more charactersand once again the gaming industry disappointed meidkw I still get surprisedbut it might chance in the future and MAYBE theyll listen to the community to fix what they to fix and change what they have to changeGreat game with beautiful visuals and extremely satisfying fighting mechanics Its very easy to figure out the core mechanics and create your own combos With that being saideven though I really enjoy the gameI wouldnt recommend this to anyone unless its on sale Its not worth a 60 price tag with the horrible online ranked system thats currently in place There is virtually no punishment for disconnecting from a ranked match online other than a slap on the wrist and a tally added to the disconnects on your profile Ive played about 20 ranked matches6 of which resulted in my opponent disconnecting after being down 2 stocks and getting caught in my ultimate art I receive no rank rating for these matchesand they receive no punishment Its ridiculous that Im being punished simply for outclassing my opponentsthe ranked leveling system is terrible There are no real specific tiers to obtainjust stars added to your rank No one wants to grind to 2or 3 star rankits really not enticing At the very least they couldve added the Demon Slayer ranks starting at Mizunoto and working your way up to Hashira or Demon Its not a rewarding experience in the slightestmovement is a bit clunky and running around gets mundane pretty fastbut the boss battles are very funand I enjoyed reliving the cinematic experiences of the show Howeverthis does not justify a 60 price tagbuy this game if you have friends to play with and want to play through the Demon Slayer story The mechanics are incredibly funthe animations look beautifuland executing combos and ultimate arts specific to the characters you love is a pure dopamine rush This game heavily lacks in the online department thoughand thats the main factor which secures the longevity of any fighting game Hopefully CyberConnect2 can push some changes that make this game completeas it still feels like an early access project when it comes to online gameplay Id love to be able to give this game a positive review one day because there definitely is something special herebut at the present time it doesnt have the fundamental aspects that keep a fighting game aliveFun and looks good However the price is not really worth it unless you really want the gameHey allI want to say I did enjoy playing through the gameits based on only one anime season and a moviethe length is still incredible lackluster Not only does it cut out many scenes that happen in the animemany scenes are also just available as flashback with collectibles But even with thosethe story is missing several scenes of the animeand some of them are even important or add a lot to the franchise To give an example In the fight against the Swamp Demon TrioTanjiro goes underwater for a certain amount of time of the fightand while I understand that you wont have an underwater fightwe just see him vanish underwater and then come back up later The awesome fight is not even displayed in a cutscene Besides thatthe free roam segments are way to shorthave underwhelming quality and polish and literally nothing interesting to offerthe combat is sufficient and funfor a competitive scene however its highly insufficientskins and not take up an entire character slotwhich puts the roster up to 8 which is unfortunately still lacklusterthe graphics look greatthe animated cutscenes look amazing too and it makes you feel like you are part of the animeits very lackluster and outdated however The Terrain Detail isnt sharpthe resolution is lowthe AA Implementation is atrocious and effects like motion blur are not even possible to turn offValue30000000UpperBoundTypeExclusiveValue60000000this will lock you out of the online mode however and may break certain actions tied to the framerate I hope this helps nonethelesssimply search Ultrachocobo on Nexusmods and follow my instructionsI thank for taking your time and should you grab the gameI hope you enjoy itWATER WHEEL WATER

which are advertised as deluxe edition characters even though you could unlock them for free if you just play through story The game includes the bare minimum for combat being a dashlight attackand special attacks making the game feel stale very quick Honestly was really hoping for something that evolved off of Naruto Storm  but instead we received a step back in qualityshinobu is wearing an excessive amount of clothesshould be patched immediatelyI want Shinobu to step on me
1,This is a fantastic game Sleeper hit of the year for methis looks like an RTS game with zombiesand neither of those things appeal to me anymore RTS games have felt rote and stale for more than a decadeand zombieswellwe hit the zombie media saturation point years ago too The label is deceptive though  They Are Billions combines elements from many different genres and the resulting mix feels decidedly fresh Theres a ton of potential herenot just for TaB but also for something like a new genre The PartTime Strategy Gameyou can play at exactly the speed you want and no faster In pause mode the buildings you place dont cost money yet so you can make building mistakes without penaltyand even more importantly  in pause mode zambees cant eat your face Yet They will thoits also got timed waves to beat like tower defense And unlike most RTSs where everything mostly boils down to a war of attrition between competing production chains and the bigger number usually winsin TaB all it takes is one zombie to destroy an entire base This is because in expanding and growing your colonyyou are also making lots and lots of humansaka futurezombies When a building gets destroyedall the workers staffing it immediately decide they want to eat your faceand the snowball effect ripples across your entire base very quickly No matter how big and powerful your base getsyou are always exactly one zahmby away from losingthe stakes and the tension are always at maximum You are also locked into ironman modeso every decision you make matters It doesnt take very many suboptimal decisions before zombores are eating your face either They will definitely your face tooand there are a lot of them Hundreds maybe If I had to countand you need a lot of resources to make that shitso you have to expand And you have to expand defensivelybecause anything you build that isnt defended is basically just enemy reinforcements The loop goes something like this  scoutclear out walkers without alerting too many of them at oncepick out defensive pointsexpand to said points and set up prelimary defensesconvert new land into resourcesconvert resources into troops and Dkeep scouting and clearing And youre gonna be doing all of those things at onceall of the timeorwellfaceeating Every part of the loop has failure potentialand with the stakes at maximum all the timethe ebb and flow of the game is incredibly satisfying and excitingbecause youre never going to be faced with exactly the same situational parameters twice Sometimes you have a couple of easy chokes to defend but not enough space to convert into resourcessometimes youve got tons of space but not chokes or resourcessometimes youre wedged in between zumbai citiessometimes youve got tons of wood but no food or stoneand sometimes a lot of zombies eat your face I think like thousands Probably You have to adjust to your circumstances and do the best with what youve got Theres never going to be an optimal build order for this gamebecause the waves can come from any direction and you only get a brief warning as to where the faceeating is gonna happen from All it takes is one weak point at a bad time and wellyou know Nom nom nomand the game engine really does an incredible job of conveying the scope of the conflict and maintaining frames for maximum face eatage The starting zomboos act like an environmental deterentand navigating and clearing them even has some stealth elements to consider Too many guns in the wrong place making too much noise and you could pull too much aggro for you to handle The zoomba hordes kind of have fluid mechanicsand tend to flow in and around your shit like nasty faceeating goo Ive never seen anything like it in an RTS before and it is very impressive The final wave does tend to lag a lotbut the metric shitton of faceeaters on the map at that point means youre going to be pausing like a schizoid on acid anyways It really is a lot of zompers More than severalpart tactical highstakes RNGesus navigationpart tower defense planningpart hordesurvival nightmarepart learnthroughfailure trainingpart getting your face et Its quite polished for a recent EA releaseand has already been patched several times Its very addicting and punishingly difficult Somehow the only thing I want to do after yelling and swearing at a screen full of recenthumans all up in my shit is reroll the next base Die againdie betterlike they deservebut do not exist yetother times you accidentally delete all your walls so it goesthanatosand executor towersfor me the rough edges are totally worth it This game is a blast and I dont know of anything quite else like itThis game is brutal It makes you feel like youre doing really well it gets you all cheery and confidentgiving you the illusion that you may win your first game Then you see that fucking message THEY ARE BILLIONS You believe your defence is finally strong enough to take the onslaught of zombies Everything seems to be going well until they break through a wall You dont notice it until they have destroyed all youre beautiful stone houses and zombies fill your entire screen You freak out taking all your troops off their towers and bringing them all to your command center beleiving that maybejust maybe you could take one last stand and defend from this brutal attack As you watch your command centers health dropyour units engulfed with zombiesyou admit defeat Your command center falls and the game over screen pops up You return to the main menu and you start again because this timethis time you might actually win a gamewould recommend 1010You play for 7 days Youve dealt with hordesand the occasional Harpy showing up and jumping a wallcausing panic for a short while You might think youve carved out a little haven where your filthy steampunk peasants can toil for youand eek out a miserable existance for themselves while you ride high as the Honorable Mayorbuild turrets where you think you might need themand back them up with some garrisoned towers You make a few more unitsand build an advanced farm for more food Life is goodyou say to yourselfsipping what is probably wine mixed with some form of oil because steampunkyou think Well let me just say that this game doesnt care about your carefully placed walls for symmetry or your finely organized stone houses that your people live in It will throw a literal wave of infected flesh at you so dense that even triple thick stone walls cant compete withthen another You watch the infected tear through the streets like a bull in a steampunk china shopcausing exponential problems as they infect more citizens You hear the last of your units die in agony as the infected swarm your Command Center Game Overbefore slamming your head into the nearest heavyblunt object repeatedly Would recommendh1They Are Billionsh1where human race is at extinctionjust wish for more turrets type more hordesamount of resources on the map etcIt felt like an endless grindbut I finally completed the game The shocking part isthis was only on normal 0 difficulty and the game was still at times brutally difficult Here are my takes on the gameI mean really hard Theres no way around it The developers clearly went Dark Souls RTS on this gamebut not necessarily as fun I still rate this game positivelyyour game gets savedeven if you altf4 I tried thisit doesnt workfor many obvious reasonsyou cant make levels end fasteras some levels require you to beat all waves and these waves are set according to a certain timeryou heard that right1 goddamn zombie is enough to end your entire game Since you cant saveyou can easily end up having wasted over an hours worth of game timehaving to replay everything this happened to me a lot in the early levelswhich is standard for any RTS game Problem isyoull never have to worry about itsince buildings never get destroyed They do however get infected and this happens within the first 10 of health Infected buildings mean everyone inside turns into a zombie By this stageyou could be looking at a gameender if it reaches your housesbut some levels can be way easier just by going a better skill route This NEVER gets explainedso I suggest that you read up on what some of the best skills arebecause youll regret it later on if you dontbut not until they become veteran with most of the perk upgrades for them Theyre cheap and incredibly effective against ALL zombie types with great armor and great health regeneration You can literally focus on getting these guys along with defensesalthough Id still recommend to combo them with other units too such as snipers and thanatosbut I should also add its very unforgiving Dont play this game if youre prone to keyboard or screen bashing The game can bring out the worst in youthe best experience for this game is setting it on windowfullscreenplaying music in the background and doing some other tasks or even watching Twitch or whatever you like to watch or do Ive literally taken a shower a couple of times and just left the game running caution thoughmake sure youre defenses are set firstbut Im mostly giving everyone insight as these are things I had to learn the hard way With all this being saidI actually loved playing the game and plan on replaying the game again on Apocalypse difficulty as well as do achievement huntingbut I think the game is pretty awesome for the most part This game is not for everyonebut worth giving a shot There are some more indepth reviews that can be readso check that out Hope my review is at least helpful to someoneBuild

disappointedbut in reality is the same mission over and over with the conditions increased Build your population to 400600800 by Day 2303destroy all the infectedsometimes dont Destroy the infected doom houses and build your population All of these missions are timedso even after youve destroyed all enemies on the map you will fail unless youve spammed enough farms for population within the time limit for a victoryand those who voiced this were told to wait for the campaign for a more streamlined experience that will ease you into the game This is not the case Difficulty is all over the place but not in the way youd expect many elements are trial and error You either build perfectly the first time by being a veteran playeror you keep retrying a level over and over until you get it right as there is no save feature in this gamemeaning you either turtle from the beginning and losebecause youre on a timeror you expand outkill all zombiesthink an area is cleared and zombies will spawn out of thin air to attack your base Ive made a habit of trying a leveldying after finding out where all the hidden spawn points areand building walls around them because I now know where they are Not fun at allthey are literally sending your unit to walk through a mapwatching himher slowlyand I mean slowlykill each infected one by one as you Attack Move to the end Your objective is to grab a box and bring it back to the entranceand so far out of the 4 missions Ive played the mission has been the exact same each time There are no abilities outside of consumables you can pick up and very little thought process for thisjust A click and watch your character slowly one shot each zombieand they are billions Worst still is there are collectables to find in these levelsbut somehow theyve ignored every prior RTS game that has included hidden items on levels and managed to design them without any visual cueand there is no way to tell what can be picked up or not unless you hover your mouse over it That barrel texture youve seen plastered throughout the map Out of that group of 8 barrels1 of them is collectablebut youll need to hover your mouse over it to find out This gets worse when random decals start to become collectables a bit of chain on the flooran identical glass bottle out of a groupand worse yet hidden collectables behind background elementslike treesonly fully visible if you disable terrain graphicsand how much resources you get in attack missionsmeaning if you miss the smallest thing you are weaker for the rest of the game until you repeat that level That leaves myself and many people on the forums complaining about spending half an hour in fully completed and cleared missions looking for the last hidden element somewhere in a giant map Look out for the walkthroughs for this onestoryor dialogue outside of an opening cutscene When a campaign was advertisedsome sort of story was expectedwhere your objective is to kill a set number of zombies running at your watch tower as you set up a static defence before the mission starts and see how it fares After several attempts at this mission I was told by a developer on the forums that I should have taken a certain talent choice to be able to place spike barricades to finish these missions This talent choice costs a lot of pointsis the 4th one down on one branchand requires a lot of investment to take If the mission was designed with these in mindwhy are they not given to the player as mandatory As there is no way to respecyou are virtually forced to take thisor absolutely minmax the best possible strategy I havent thought of yet After 9 attempts of redesignsscreenshots of zombie pattern layouts to figure out where every choke hold is coming fromand a lot of trial and errorIve come to realise that the balancing in this game is simply not therebut as a RTS player and huge fan myself who has tried more or less all of them and has gone through the thick and thin of different campaign ideas and evolutionsI can tell you that this isnt just a difficulty problembut fundamentally poor design Most RTS games ease the player into understanding fundamental mechanics and slowly unlock units and aspects so they can learn how each work at a streamlined pacethis does not This isnt the fun type of difficulty eitherbut the cheap one that forces you to start over because you werent building optimally since the very starteven at the opening tutorial of the gameleaving very little room for experimentationinsulting them if theyve only tried their game for 2 hours telling them to put more in past the refund process if they criticise it What a messI sincerely regret supporting this developer in any way and heavily encourage people to avoid themOverall23 are fine and fun on hardest difficulty howevermap 4 is a RNG dependent win everytime and isnt fun at all the agro is a little ridiculous at times and the cities  agro is retarded if you get a wave that goes through a city its game over Also dont get me started on seeing harpies on day 10 I find the map gen on other maps is okaybut on map 4 its litterally disgusting theres random holes in the ground and werid tunnels through rock faces and forests The food is a little werid at times toosometimes theres some other times theres litterally none Food on all other maps is okaythat the zombie AI is welldone atleast if the following is true waves always tend to attack weak points making the game a little harder and zombies are very unpredictable which is the way it should bebut this information will probably be outdated soon because ive heard theyre adding a campaign which will most likely fix this problemstructureszombies etcstructures and zombies is horrible Very repetitive gameplay and few ways to explore different strategies Also a major change they need is a new score system It needs more factors effecting it Like add more score for resource productioneconomypower etc sall i got was a lame machine gun mech Attack is lame and doesnt pack enough punch otherwise everything else with this unit is okay4 Even when rich its still pointless because if you expand enough you will always have enough room for mills I will also include a small power plant buff here aswellseems to underperform for its costlove the shocktower and balista but a rocket one would be awesome aswellI dont know why they dont already have this in the gametheres a wood agestone age but no metal age Theres the foundary yes and some cool things to research but no metal houseswalls etcive got screenshots of 3 VOD 10 tiles from eachother on map 2like powereconomyresource production etcmaybe map  should be a volcano wasteland with ash floating everywherewith low visibility but no foodkindof like map 4 except no broken agrostructures and maybe a ability to build on watertook me over 30 tries and 100 rerolls to win because of stupid map issuesGreat gamebut it doesnt respect your time Implement a save feature and I would give this a wholehearted recommendation but having hours of work wiped away in an instant is very frustrating and makes me want to uninstall Disable achievements if you dont play ironman mode but give the option to the people that dont want to restart a 6 hour survival gameMy favorite strategy game of all timesyou play and try over and over until you become a very good strategistits always fun to build farming factoriesthen build a bigass army or defensesand watch thousands of zombies trying hard to ruin everything you madewhat would be the BEST ADDITION EVER in this gamean ENDLESS mode with a bigger mapwhere the goal would be to survive as most days as possible with increasing difficultythis would make this game the best ever and toons of people would stream or record trying hard to beat the world record  I wish any developer would read thisIve had to uninstall this twice because of the devastating effect its having on my productivityGood game Would be godlike with some form of multiplayer coopbut im not sure how it could be best implementedIf they added coop with one town center to protect this game could be considered FinishedbDisclaimer At the point of this review the game is still in Early Access and will stay so until early 2018which still offers a lot of replayabilitybevolve your facilities and fortify your colony against zombie strugglers and big waves of infected that this game throws at you in regular intervalspart tower defenseyou have the ability to pause the game at any given time to your convenienceto assign unitsplace buildings and correct mistakes You need to micro manage several ressources in order to keep your colonies runningfeed citizensmanage electricity and build a tight defense grid so you can outlast the waves of infectedthey will infect every colony building that comes across their wayspawning more infected and spiraling out of control until they have overrun your main baseyou have to survive a chosen amount of days and survive the big wave at the endevery building has a very distinct look so you can immediately see where you have built whatgoing from hunters with bow and tents to solid buildings and mechsthe amount of units on screen can be quite impressivethe performance is going strongon my PC and my laptopwhere I tested the game since 030even though some of the UI elements are not perfectly placedallthough the units responses get quite repetetive soon Gunfiremusic and ambience are done wellperfectly playablebuilding placement could be improved when it comes to diagonal placement or placement close to one anotherplan and execute at any given time is a big plus for mewhen you buld up great defenses and mow down thousands of infected with snipersflamethrowers and rocketswhile they are trying to breach your defenses Beating a horde and seeing your plans work out is immensly satisfyingbut a mistake in your planning listleaving the zombies a place to break throughit was because of mistakes I made and it is really fun to learn and overcome these obstacles I recommend to skip experienced youtubers and figure it out for yourselfas there are several maps to beat at the momentavailable once you have beaten the one beforebut it becomes managable once you get the hang of it See it as a challengewho are in close contact to the community and deliver regular updates like a veteran systemevolving mayersa tavern for mercenariesetcthen chances are very high that this game is totally worth your moneyimprove and mow down thousands of on screen enemieswhich is not something I do very often with an EA title Like Dead Cellsthis is a diamond in the roughso no review bombing This game is amazingnever before had i put sleep aside for a game as i have for this one Its 2am and ive just got done with a  hour sessionim extremely tired as i get up every day at 6am for work luckly i have the next two days off but before i head to bed i eagerly wanted to leave this positive review because this is truly an awesome game im literally smiling right now because of how much fun i just had with this gamelmao and its single playerI have tried hard to like this game  I dontits even worse nowthis is a timechallenge puzzle game that looks like a zombie rts  There is no room for flexibility and creativity in the build order  If you dont know and follow the correct build order religiouslyyou get annihilated at the endwith no clear indication of whether you are keeping a strong enough economic pace to win  There is one right way to playor you lose  Thats not fun for meh1Millions and billions and trillions of zombiesh1and theres a line in there which is Millions and billions and trillions of cats which reminds me of this game Except instead of catsin the game there are zombies Millions and billions and trillions of zombies In the bookthe cats all eat each other until theres only one left yeahI knowkids books are weirdmy mother in law gave it to usbut in They Are Billions unfortunately they dont consume each otheronly your people and your buildings and your soul in general Anywaypatiently waiting for a hefty discount that would never really materializeso you dont need another review explaining the game and going over the mechanicssince 24000 brave reviewers have already gone before me and Im feeling rather lazy Insteadyoull get a quick yesthis review is very short by my usual standard rundown my general impressions and personal experienceRTStower defense and actionRPG missions to boottons of replayability everywhere as well as survival mode  if you enjoy ityou can sink a lot of time into itreally giving you the chance to challenge yourselftowerswalls and gates into a tower defense game to save your townso youre really just producing meat shields to fling at zombiesbut there are some things holding it back from being truly fun to play The lack of a custom save system is the biggest drawback for meespecially on later missions I do not want to lose hours of work because I made a mistake and didnt realize it By all meanshave an optional system that is implemented at higher levels that rewards you for choosing this difficultybut the fact that even on the easiest difficulty you cannot saveload is frustrating to meIm giving it a thumbs up I absolutely love the setting and the aestheticand I think it does a good job of genre blending  enough to keep me hookedeven as Im swearing at itplease follow  urlhttpstoresteampoweredcomcurator289716My Curator Pageurl Excellenttower defense and a fresh take on survival RTSthis nails it
1,Words alone cannot express how amazing KSP isthis is not a game for everyone  If you are in the market for some fastpaced space combat sim with all kinds of weapons and big explosionsthen this isnt what you are looking for  Except for the big explosions KSP has you covered thereif you ever dreamed of actually being an astronautthis is definitely for you  If you sometimes forget to breath when watching recordings of the Apollo moon landingsthis is definitely for you  If precisemeasured flying careful planning and deltav budgeting are what drives youthis is definitely for you  If you want to learn about Orbital Mechanics and are dying to know what the Oberth Effect or a Hofman Transfer Orbit arethis is definitely for you If you like Physicsthis is definitely for youif you just like building rediculously large rockets and watching them explode with glorious comedy when they fail catastrophically because you forgot ONE PART then this is also definitely for youfunfrustratingmind bogglinghugehilariouscomplicateddeepand just plain awesomeOne day my daughter came home from school and asked me Have people actually travelled to the Moon  How is it possibleI would have answered yesbut I dont really know how  Its very complicatedwith lots of math and science  You might learn about it in a physics class in 1 years timeI answered Herelet me show you and fired up Kerbal Space Program  We built a moon rocket and launched itme steering and she hitting the separation detonation buttons when needed  3 minutes later we had landed on the moonSquadfor enabling me to give that answerMy 8 year old son broke away from Minecraft today He sat on my lap while we made a rocket He asked questions about rockets We made it into space and he askedAre we in space We came down and the friction caused our heat shield to glow His eyes were wide open as we slowed down We pressed the space bar to deploy our parachutes but were going too fast and our chutes failed We crashed and he asked if the kerbal was OK I said yes as I hit ESC and went back to the VAB and changed a few things A few minutes laterwe landed our capsule safely and he had the biggest smile on his face I havent heard a word about Minecraft since Thank you for making this wonderful gameSee that little grey circle in the night skyimpossibly far away You can go theretrying to get one into orbit Laugh at all the explosionsand the everincreasing body count Realize you have no idea how orbital mechanics workmaybe watch a Youtube video Maybe take a step back and spend a few hundred hours just exploring your home planet with a plane or rovermoreorless in one piece Realize theres another moona bunch of other planetsasteroids that you can capture and bring into orbitresources that you can harvest into rocketfuel on the surface of other planetsAND an amazing modding scene that can infinitely more gameplaybTo remove any doubtsthis is by far iTHEi best space simulator out there bwith whatwhenand howliterallythousands upon thousands of kilometers to walkdriveor fly your epic creations orif your not very creativepreset or other players shipslandersore collection astronaut housing bases on other planetsand spaceplanesthe way you want themearning science in order to get better equipment and rocket parts I recommend for newish players who know at least basic orbits  how to get to the Munscienceand reputation for your own space organizationI recommend having a little more experience before jumping right in The Career mode adds A LOT of purpose to the gameas well as adding new challenges such as having to make landings in certain locationssending satellites in specific orbitsmaking space stations at specific altitudesplacing a flag on a certain bodycollecting ore from a planetetcthere are several user created mods that really expand on the experienceadding new parts or game mechanicsthus rendering Kepler and Newton proud generally speakingit allows one to see how actual launches and orbits work in the real worldthis would be a long list with all of themhoweverthey are still good and create a real sense of depth and can deliver a lostinspace kind of a feel It makes me feel so small compared to the vastness of our world Plusthe graphical style really fits the style of the overall gameit was a lot easier to get to Minmus after this It was difficult to get to Dunahoweveronce I got thereI have gradually learned enough to go pretty much anywhere and have made a permanent base on Laythe complete with science labcrew pod and a brand spanking new air breathing engine jet transportas well as a souped up Rover for them to drive I have been to almost all of the planets So basicallyit takes time to get good at this gamebut I assure youits rewarding and so spectacular to see how huge this world is And this one is scaled downtoo Howevernew tutorials should be very helpful for the beginnerjust gets repetitive sometimes ahem devs please add more musicbecause it is a little more difficult and takes more resourcefulness several hours if your like me and really take your timeespecially if you send a 3 manned mission to Eeloo youll get faster the more experience you get thoughthis is a wonderful simulator offering a lot of real science with funproviding lots of hours of engaging gameplay I am so happy the developers have successfully brought this amazing game out of beta I have purchased this game so long agoand the updates have vastly improved the game and have solved many of the problems I have dealt with Thank you for reading this book of a reviewand I hope this really helps Feel free to leave a comment if you have any questionsI have over 4 hours logged and played the demo for several hours I will try to get to them as soon as possible Happy KerballingThis is an incredible gameIve almost got 3 hours into it and Im still looking forward to firing it up nearly every daythis game will get you therefirst handand let you have your hand at designing space crafts and planesflying themand of coursecrashing them in big glorious explosionsphysicsorbital mechanicsaerodynamicsetc this really happensI have two friends that are rocket scientists one does ion drive researchthe other designs microsatellitesI work at a large universityand after playing this game for a few monthsI could easily talk to them about their workwhere they drop terms like ISPTWRretrogradenormalsetcterms that I now fully understandyou can play in career mode which walks you though the beginning steps of putting a rocket into spaceto orbitingto visiting the Mun and beyond If you need more helpthe YouTube scene is quite impressivewith people like Scott Manley producing really professional and charming video tutorial series I am not a lover of simulationtype gamesI play mostly FPSs and RPGsbut I found this game quite easy to pick and up get intothis game is certainly not easyfor examplelanding and returning from Eve the Venuslike planet in the Kerbin system is one of the hardest tasks in the gameand while most of the game is fairly nonstressful in its naturelanding spaceships is a tense experienceespecially when Jebs life is on the line For those that find it difficult to master some of the more difficult tasksthere are impressive control mods like MechJeb where you essentially point at a spot on a planet and press the Land There buttonMechJeb does the restin the game you are progressing through the space race for the people of the Kerbin panetyoull get to know and love the kerbalnauts that will fly your craftespecially Jebediah Kermanpilot extraordinaire and fearless hero to the Kerbin peopleis activeorganizedand quite friendlymostly found on Reddit and the Squad forumsyou can get any question answeredor read mission reports from someones latest missionor get news on upcoming updates for the game The only time you see people getting belligerent on these forums is when some is misbehaving toward otherseach release every new months bringing a lot of new features and parts to build withand just this week the update to KSP brings many new rocket parts built in collaboration with NASA plus a mission to save Kerbin from killer asteroidsfrom new reallife inspired rocket parts so you can build your own Saturn Vto impressive new systems that enable for example planetary mining so you can get more fuel on route to your targetto just plain fun mods like the nuclear pulse rocketwhich explodes variedsized nuclear bombs behind a large plate to produce thrust scientists actually design this beast in the 5smany KSP players switch to the realism modswhich give you the real solar systemtruly deadly reentriesrealistic communication constraints that require building satellite networksmore realistic aerodynamics modeling egFerrams amazing FAR modreal lifesupport constraintsetc that make for a significantly more challenging and rewarding experience if that doesnt trip your triggerthe forums have organized challenges with leaderboardsto see who canfor exampleget to the Mun with the least number of partsor eject the most Kerbals out of the solar systemall great fun with the competitors meticulously documenting their missionsget this game It was the best 5 bucks I ever spent1st hour playing WHAT DO I DO WHY IS IT BLOWING UPproper reviewso much to do Bored of building rockets Build a space plane Fed up of the mun Go to Duna Dont want to leave the atmosphere Build whatever you want The list goes onsome of the nicest people Ive met have came from this game They are such a helpful bunch and Im glad Im with them Theyll most likely love to help you Theres also a bunch of fantastic YouTubers such as Scott Manley and others too many to name Im not complaining much about this one as rocket science isnt exactly easy is it You can learn from trial and error and its how I learnt alot but some things you just have to read up about or watch a tutorial on youtube There isnt really much of a tutorial in game eitherAs a Physics student I never quite understood entirely Classical Mechanics till I met Jebediah Kerman He taught me everythingthe real thinghe became de facto my true master and I couldnt be more grateful for what he did for me We became best buddieshe gave me courage to continue with my studies I cant recall how many long nights have we spent exploring other worlds completely drunk and having existencial talks ThoughI never really understood a damn word of what he saidThis certainly was the best  Euros ever spent on a game I love this gameits learning curve and its modabilitythis game is for youno matter how stupid the concept may look at first and then try it out in the cold hard reality of spacewhy staging is absolutely necessary and how to conserve fuel If you dontyou probably wont make it into orbitmuch less to the Mun or even other planets Even after more than 6 hours of playing Kerbal Space ProgramIm learning stuff the hard way by losing vehicles and KerbalsI wouldnt have played it half the time I actually did and wouldnt have enjoyed it as much at the same timejust to learn the basicslook how the game behavesetcbut after that you should really check out the Kerbal Space Program forums mod section httpforumkerbalspaceprogramcomforums35AddonReleasesandProjectsShowcase KerbalStuff httpbetakerbalstuffcom  andor the Curse Mod Page httpwwwcursecomkspmodskerbal  Theres mods for so many aspects of the gamethanks to all those mods The community forums are also really great and helpfulplease make sure you dont forget to mod it at some pointreallybut gravity And a heartless bitch she is indeeddisintegrations and death There is no perfect rocket At some point stuff will blow up and you will have to start a whole mission againso things change from time to time For examplewhen the game was upgraded from  to 3the whole science system got a rework and a lot of my rockets that were built specifically for science grinding became useless The update was great thoughsince it got rid of grinding altogetherThis is the ultimate in sandbox geekery If you have a passing interest in astronomya love for freeform gamesor just enjoy sending computergenerated life forms to their death repeatedlythis is the game for youconvince your grandparents to get thisIf you have a deep longing to attempt landing on the surface of a staror the gumption to fling countless people into space without any consideration toward their livesthen this may be the game for you Failure is the only optionor how you really nailed that Hohmann transfer Noitll probably be the flaming wreckage you created where no one should have survivedbut somehow did My game once glitched as a Kerbal was falling from the upper atmosphere and he bounced on the surface He bounced And not in the crumpled heap of flesh and bone matter way He bounced off the ground and appeared to be coming in for a graceful finish to a mission gone horribly wrongthe only type of mission that truly exists He fell from space And lived Forget spaceerect a statueyou might ask By landing on the engine so it was primed for vertical takeoff I forgot about my horizontal velocityhoweverand ended up ripping the engine apart I had all the fuel I needed for a return missionbut the broken engine was left kilometers away Oops At least I could plant a cool flagbecause that is the first irresponsible thing everyone always thinks to do stranded person in space Send more people to help them The first mission collided with the Mun at 6 ms Rough landing The second mission landedbut I was probably 5km awaywhich isnt all that badall things considered I had the stranded Kerbal run toward the landed shipbut it was taking forever So I started using his little jetpack to expedite things Lemons and lemonade As it turns outyou can actually disintegrate a Kerbal if you get too much forward momentum and collide with something solidlike the surface of the Mun You will forever be in our thoughtsMac KermanI still hadnt updated that section of the ship Instead I landed on my side and planned on using elevation as a natural ramp Bulletproof logic At least this Kerbal had the dignity of a fieryfiery death An honorable death By my own handsyour little Kerbal guys can die and be listed in the ambiguous Lost column It was with great sorrow that I saw Mac Kermans name in there I didnt care so much about the other guys Who cares about the second guy on the Mun But heres the thingseveral years into my career mode Mac magically reappeared and was ready for action He came back from the dead And what was the first thing he wanted to do Go back into space To die againyes to this game Just yes I currently have a Kerbal orbiting the second moonMinmus Yeshe is in a stable orbit without a ship Just him And hes been there for close to 3 years now Ill get around to that at some pointThis game should be standard issue in school physic classes Taught me more about orbital mechanics than anything elseI have 15 hours in this game and Im planning to major in Aerospace Engineering because of how much I enjoy itI score this Simulation game 11just hit the buy button It exceeds all expectations The game isnt finished yetbut I dont care They cant fail anything anymore Just buy it Or wait for a sale and then buy it Whenever you buy ityou wont feel ripped off I guarantee you thatthere is a reason this game has a fanbase of millions Theres a reason Im scoring this game 1 out of 1 I find this game to be the most addictive thing in my library I even try NOT to play itbut when I do it keeps me awake at night and busy while doing daily choreslike the name might have hintedis a Space Program Simulator Game There is the career modeinvolving missions and researchand there is the sandbox mode that allows you to run free with it The game is in early access and the career needs work I find the missions redundant and confusingbut its already funand this review is more about the sandbox modeso you set out your own missionslike fly to the moon or another planet Then you have to build your landerroversatelite or whateverthe means of manouvering in space and a rocket to get it in space Then you have to find out not just how to get something off the ground and into spaceyou also need to learn to make an orbit Then you learn how to manipulate orbits in order to get around There are no concessions By the time youve figured out how to get where you want to goyou will have learned the basics of actual spaceflight You dont need a science degree to do this and to understand thisthe game is brilliant this way You can get there by trial and error and in a fun way tootycoon gamesLego the plastic bricksscience fiction in generalscience in generalrockets and blowing stuff upreal space exploration or even have slight positive stance on looking at the sky at night willing to learnyou send your Kerbal individuals they all have names on grand adventures Their homeworld has a cicumference of about 1km and it comes with  moons The bigger one looks like our own moon and it can even cast a solar eclipse really a fun and beautifull feature In the Kerbol name of the star system you will also find the planets MohoEve with its moon GillyKerbin with Mun and MinmusDuna with Ikethen a gasgiant called Jool with no less then 5 moons plus finally the dwarfplanet Eelo The distances are measured in millions of kilometers when traveling in space It may be a scaled down planetary systembut that doesnt mean its small I have never before adventured through such an immense ingame world Each planet and moon comes with its own biomes and anomalies to discover and explore and youll busy for hundreds of hours before youve done it all Everyone plays in this same systen so everyone can share their adventures with eachotheryou know what the other player is talking aboutI had little expectations It looked like a modbut then I reached space It was like the opening of the movie 1 a Space Oddisey The space whales ingame music started playing and my contraption was floating in a serene fashion high above kerbinever going higher and higherkerbin getting smaller and smallerI passed the Mun lost kerbinthen found the eva button I found out stands for Extra Vehicular Activityor Go play outside so I lost my Kerbal Hours of my life passed by while staring at this phenomenon called KSPwhile drooling over my keyboardbut they cant fail this anymore Nasa has made an addon for itso now asteroids are also part of the game and can be landed on or grabbed Nasa also added their own rocket parts based on the new SpaceX rockethow awesome is that And the developer has even announced multiplayer I dont know how this will work and what we could do in an online gameand Its already more fun if a friend plays this game toobut its anticipated by me nonethelessbut boy did I learn a lot I understood the concept of flying faster horizontally then you fell verticallybut putting it to practice requires more then just going SoI watched Nasa do it They pivot the rocket as soon as it has picked up enough speedso ok I built a rocket with steering parts and pivotted it correctly after a few tryouts and finally worked out an eliptical orbit to play with At this point the concept that Isaac Newton put down of every action has a pose and equal reaction gets a whole new meaning in orbit youll see KSmileyyou get more advanced Your rockets become more stablebecause you know how to make themyou get to other planets fasterbecause you know how to get there My rockets grew in size from around 6 parts for the rocket with my first moonlanderof which I built a new version every nightto about 13 in my rocket plus massive oversized truck I landed on Dunawhich took me  weeks to build It went from slapping together a simple contraption to a mindboggling engineering puzzle that even my pc or the games engine found hard to process when launchedlike how to dock in space There are several things to dobut I warn you this can make or break your experience Try as hard as you can if youre stuckplay with a friend you knowtogether on one pc thinking and building and if all else failsthen try youtube or a guide Letting guides take you by the hand can ruin your experience But when youve reached this point it just means a whole new world of Kerbal opens before your eyes I think every KSP player has posted screenshotsvideosguides both online and private to friends The ammount of material you can dig up is staggeringdont install mods as you just start playingexept for scansat perhaps but dontthe other mods will lure you Mods potentially ruins the experience as they can either make it to hard or too easy Ive reached the point where making an orbit has become a boring thing to do and I had seen all the parts ingame Ive reached the point of not getting my ships docked This was the point where I looked on youtuberead guides and reviews for mods and then installed modsmods like MechJeb in flight telemetry and autopilot optionsuse at your own riskadvanced cockpits cockpit screensbuttons to pressexternal camerasawesomemore partsgraphical addonsscansat scans planetsawesomeetc But with all games in early accessmods can be broken when the game is patched But when youve reached that pointKSP can be enhanced in such ways it brings about limitless posibilitiesas realistic as you want it to bededicated hard work and deserves all credit it can get When its doneit just means it has reached a point where the developers can call it a complete game With more standard partsmore physicsmore careermore tycoon and basicly more game then it is now From that moment this game will only expand as if it were the universe itself thanks to mods and I dont think this game will die out soon Just buy the gameyoull have fun for years to come I promissI stand by my review This game will stand its groundcheck out Steamhookupscom if theres a good deal in it for youThere are no other games really like this You willin a terribly entertaining waylearn some fundamental of orbital mechanicsrocket scienceaerodynamicsastrophysics and even a bit of mechanical engineering and straight physicsno zombiesno monstersno combat No grand conquests and raising flags over captured enemy bases Yet you have never and will never play a game that will challengeentertain and reward you like KSP will The learning curve is stiff but not terrible You play it at your own pace becausewellthere is no other pace you can play it at Games like Dark Souls are hard because youve got to have the right mix of luck and muscle memory and you have to throw yourself at it again again KSP can be hard because calculating the right setup for the right injection burn to put you in a viable position to get past Ike into a stable orbit around Duna with enough fuel to get you home is a staggering undertakinga lot of planning and forethoughrepeatedlywhen you look back and realize you didnt have a chance to play KSPindepthengagingwell balanced and changing but simplified to make it fun to play simulator for building and deploying rockets and ships to go into spacevisit and explore other worlds and travel a solar systemthere are dozens of mods I want to try but havent had the chance This is the kind of game thats fun and engaging for years and years Sometimes you need to step outside the regular run of the mill and see why a game like this has tens of thousands of reviews that are almost universally positiveKerbal Space Program is essentially NASA by trial and error All the fun of building things and launching them into spacewithout the hassle of acquiring funding or the responsibility of having to return people to Earth safelythey want to go to there You can get them there by designing rockets and space planes of nearunlimited complexity read convolutednessand testing them out Some of your designs will succeedand some will experience a rapid unplanned vehicle disassembly But thats half the funyou can really start to see how incredibly indepth this game is There is an entire solar system modeled herewith 7 planets and a bunch of moons orbiting themgiving you tons to do  enough for hundreds of hours of play As of this writingIm over 1 hours spent ingameand the furthest Ive gotten from Kerbin the Earthanalog starting planet is Eveone of the nearest planets and even thenI was forced to watch helplessly as the craft crashed into the surfacehaving spent all of its fuel on the voyage thereI was looking up how to do gravity assists to get to other planetsand looking up actual rocket science formulastrying to understand the principles behind them in order to improve my designsand as such its a little rough around the edges the most obvious to me is that the surface of Kerbin is devoid of any kind of structures besides the space centerbut new updates are coming out with decent regularity Most recently added is the career modewhich starts you out only with a handful of partsrequiring you to perform experiments and generate reports around the solar system to gain science  a currency you can use to unlock new part selections The part limitations give a new kind of challengeand obtaining science gives the game a more objective focuswhich I found very refreshing  especially just as sandbox mode was starting to lose some of its drawspace planes andor whatever ridiculous contraption you can think of sounds funits a safe bet that youll enjoy this game Despite still being in alphaits already more than worth what I paidA great game if you know what youre doing If you dont know what youre doingit becomes mindless fun involving explosions and terrified astronautsI played this game with my sonnow he wants to be an austronauntonce upon a time if my son would have asked me Dadhow did people land on the moon I wouldnt know what to tell him But todaywhen my son asked me that question awww yisI simply said  Ill show you howand we fired up the game I was ablewith the help of KSPto show my son the beauty of trial and errorthe difficulty of space travel and just how vast and empty space isand how small we are I let him built it himselfparachutes on a moon landerbackwards engines and everything I remember his look of disbeleif and surprise as our first rocket

1,Bypass the crappy K launcher modified Civ forums postrightclick on XCOM select PropertiesSo this game is quite an interesting one I played and attempted it several times since I own and love XCom Enemy Within It bested me each time and left me in quite a seething rage at points I decided to give it another go with the War of The Chosen expansion coming and I have to say that this game did finally win me over This game can be brutally hard to you It really expects you to take your time and think about your moves for the first half of the game You get a little more leeway once you get to the second half and you have some vetern soldiers and their abilities Let me address the most controversial topic firstthe mission timersoverwatch and they make sense thematically  I only lost one mission with them and that was my fault of not planning properly There are mods on the workshop that alter them but I think you should give them a go as the developers intended first They create a great sense of tension and you really have to evaluate your moves each turn I love optimizing stuff and this really became great fun once I got the hang of them Just expect to lose a few times while you learn how those missions play outthey are hard in the beginning and get easier as the game progresses Most the difficulty also comes from not knowing really where to begin The game does not do a great job of making things clear to you I did have to watch some videos and do some reading to really get a good grasp of the game Also it doesnt make it clear what negative effects come from not attempting missions I got a mission for a supply raid which I didnt attempt and the aliens ended up recapturing that territory I didnt expect that and it wasnt communicated to me that that would be the result The game likes to omit other valuable tacital data as well so I highly recommend the following modsso long as you are ok losing a few times to learn the game Its a fantastic strategy game and one of my personal favorites What really got me with this game was how truly fair it actually did seem Even in the face of overwhelming oddssmart tactical play saved me many times and it felt very rewarding Honestly this game reminds me of dark souls a lot It isnt just about the stats of your in game charactersits about the knowledge you gain as well I hope to see you out there Commanderh1uTLDRuh1base  troop managementkilling aliensgame missions are the more active half where you command a number of soldiers through a map chunk with an objective to complete such as to kill all aliensdestroy a targetor rescue a key personnel You command troops through the gridbased map and take actions based on the number of action points they possess each turn these actions include movementuse weapon fire gunmeleereloaduse itemsand go on overwatch aka set up an ambush if an enemy enters line of sight Your troops gain experience for taking part in missions and killing enemiesyou are tasked with upgrading your base of operations by commanding the research team to discover new tech that you can employ such as base upgrades and new weapons and engineering new troop upgrades like usable items in the field and improved armor There is a calendar portion of this section in that your actions need to counter the enemy alien activity if the alien activity reaches a certain point by a given deadlineyour game will automatically end In the beginning it is pretty easy to lower the enemys activity progress but it gets more difficult as the game goes on Thereforeyou need to strategically decide which missions you want to accept do you want to get more money so you can buy more necessary supplies or do you want to complete a mission to give yourself more time and lower the enemys activity barthe alien bases look very high tech and are equipped with incredible weaponry XCOM  can be a bit demanding in the graphicsperformance department The game has improvedenhanced

bHoweverbbe sure to distinguish if mods require DLC or not eg some mods require War of the Chosen WOTCbut then the shot misses and you are left wondering just what the heck happened Its not a common occurrencebut it can happen enough to be noticeableI remember there were some long loading screens right before a mission beganand killing aliens is always a good timeI only wrote this review for

youre planning on playing with modstheir absolute horrid new launcher everyone complains about will NOT let you I simply installed  mods and I immediately was met with crashes upon launching the gamego to your Xcom folderand go here XComWarOfTheChosen\Binaries\Win64\Launcherand make a shortcut of the Mod Launcher add noredscreens review and voila Mods will work and none of that BS new launcherits so god damn fun I got attached to a couple of my squads and I end up savescumming just to save them l o l Seriously fun and love the mechanics and story so farThe game is goodbut all of a sudden the obligatory K launcher stopped recognizing that I own the game Same as a lot of people who posted before meI now only see the buy option instead of play Adding this review to attract attention to the problemunlike other peopleI will not change the review to positive as long as K launcher is there at all When the game was soldit launched directly from Steamand only later was the K launcher added on top of it So it was not part of the dealand this situation shows that it is a risk factor ThereforeI cannot take it upon myself to recommend buying this game on Steam as long as that risk is thereKs new launcher disables moddingwhich is supported by Steam Workshopentirely They refuse to listen to community feedback and are blocking reviews that point this using by abusing Steams terrible antireview bomb system I loved this game so muchand mods made it perfect The vanilla game is boring and has many glaring personal taste issues that I cant overlookbut I USED TO be able to fix with modsOne of my all time favouritesmy safe spacemy old friendmy XCOMas I dogetting far too emotionally attached to imaginary soldiers then feeling very real pain when they die They will die It will probably be your faultI played a total of 1 hours within 1 week of buying this incredible game It is THE best small squad strategy game Ive ever played Yesthe game can be brutal at times and it can make you so angry or annoyed that you alt f4 but it also gives you a feeling of euphoria in the times when a lucky shot saves a mission or everything goes right The workshop is incredible with countless mods that improve or flavour the gameAfter 44 hoursI finally feel qualified to render an opinionThis is hard game I had to play it on Easy setting first time as it was too stressful otherwise HoweverIm gong back to play on Normal now Wish me luckh1 1 like for every miss on 99 shot D h1This is an amazing gamebut one I cannot recommend on its current stateas of June 1the publisher made a clientit forces you to launch the game through their clientand said client CRASHES when you have a heavily modded setup like I used to 44 hours invested into the gameand k decided to remove my ability to enjoy their product based on greed Their client has LESS functionality than communitycoded solutions like the AML XCom launcher and made the game unplayable for mePlay it normallybeat itplay witcher 3 or something for a whileinstall Long War  modfall in love againI have no friendsthe soldiers in this game are my only friends The choices i make could get my friends killed Moral of the story i still have no friendsGot this during the Humble Bundle sale for only 1 This is actually my first intro into the XCOM franchise and Turn Based SRPGs in generaloften missing They have also been seen committing friendly fire and blowing themselves up with grenades Long story short Fuck Sectoidsincurring critical hit bonuses if they hitwhile where are several different species all with their own unique abilities As a Commander your task is crowd controlassessing the relative threat level of your enemy and adjusting your tactics accordingly in a dynamically changing environmentpurchase soldiers  equipmentresearch tech and expand your on base facilities Its also where you get to play doll errI mean customize your soldiers You have a wide array of customization options available from the bat You can self insert into yourself and friends into the game and watch in horror as theyre brutally murdered by an army of ADVENT mall ninjas while you get hugged to death by a well endowed lamia There are countless mods available on the workshop that add additional weaponscosmetics and classes This is arguably one of the most powerful selling points as it tremendously increases replayabilitythe more prone they are to panic When a soldiers morale is too low your only real option is to dismiss him from active duty as he becomes too much of a liability If a soldier dies you can save them to your character pool The game automatically does this when you create a soldier So when you start a new campaign youll find familiar faces reincarnated as different classesbut youll often be forced to focus on specific areas of research because of constrained resources I initially hated this being a completionistbut now I love it because it encourages decisive actionthe game isnt without its flawswhich is the school that this game was developed in The concepts of dicerolls and RNG can be frustrating at times If youre observant enough youll notice a brief twitch as your soldier appears to aim as to deliberately miss a shot which can be ragecringe inducing especially when it happens four times in a row A rule of thumb is that anything less than a 1 chance should be treated as a 5 chance This is a game that can screw you even when the odds are in your favorbut thats XCOMbabywhich can easily ruin a playthrough This happens because different parts of the mesh are generated on different processor threads The community overhaul Long War  mitigates this at the expense of longer load timesbut Id recommend you beat the base game at least once before ever considering LWbut this can make it very difficult not to do so Theres also whats referred to as a line of play This is an arbitrary point in the level where all pods will begin to converge on your location If youre lucky and quick you can slip through them and stealth a runbut this is nearly impossible in vanilla XCOM  One of the worst bugs by far however is aggro range calculation It seems to do this individually for each soldier you select So what can end up happening is youll move one soldier just outside the enemy aggro rangethen move another soldier before the game can recalculate the aggro distance for that soldier By the time you click youve stepped on an aggro tile RIPI can say that if youre a fan of military scifi shooters and SRPGs then definitely give this a try This was a steal for 1 If youre lucky itll also enhance your sex life as you discover how much of a masochist you really arebut by the end of your first playthrough ADVENT will be DaddyThis game will make you believe RNG is a sentient being that actively tries to make you have a mental breakdownSoif you read the negative reviews before you read the positive reviewsor if you are considering reading the negative reviews before you buyI have the following thing to tell you because there are a lot of whining people in the negative reviewsdont play this gamedont play this gamedont play this gamedont play this gamewhat makes you think XCOM will be easyits not a battleand certainly not the warmake them yoursand suddenly they will conquer alland in times of need4 might be 1Lookthis game is honestly pretty goodbut the real heart of it was always the mods You can play as anything you damn well want with the mods you have at your disposalor waitlet me correct myself you could have played as anything you wanted prior to K forcing their shitty launcher into the game The old one worked plenty finethe new one literally doesnt In factit seems to have bricked my game to even using modsit will simply freeze up when I try to load them in nowbut it sucks that K decided to ruin the best part of their damn game for I dunnoa launcher that lets you see their other shitty games youd already see on Steam The old one worked finebring it back and Ill be able to rate XCOM as being the good game it is
1,i am 7 years young and have been gaming for over 4 years i have played many p c gamesmany board gamesmany card games  i like grim dawn  it is challenging  it has many different levels it can be played not just levelling up but various ways of causing damage and armour for protection    the variety of different combinations of these and spells  weapons  gems makes it a game for the thinking player or if yopu prefer just hack and slashwelI just wanted to say thank you Crate Thank you for making a game that I and my family has truely enjoyed My wife and I both played this game alot Also I even gotten my sick mother into playing this game She has never played games before until i got her to finally start with this one It helped over the last several months to help take her mind off her pain level while she was sick this past year If i was unable to play my wife would play using my account to game with my mother This is a magical game for me and my family My mother finally passed this morning at 24amand im sitting here looking at your expansion Even though its going to hurt me and my wife both of us plan on getting the expansion so we can continue our adventures I just wanted to say thank you to all the people at your company who made this game You have no idea of the lives that you touchand how the things you make can help ease the pain a family endures Its nice to unplug once in a while from life and have fun Im going to miss her alot But our characters will pick up the torch and continue on for her Thank youIt is important to note that Grim Dawn is an indie game Aside from the engine itselfthe majority of the games systems were designed and programmed initially by only two peoplewith the help of a bunch of part timersand eventually forming a much larger team after a successful kickstarter This is both a good and a bad thing Despite the limited resourcesthis is very much a concept piece with tight designsystems that knit together perfectly symbiotically with no bloat This is a fantastic gamehowevermight find themselves overwhelmed at first Both a potential upside and downside to Grim Dawn is that it doesnt put restrictions on you for training wheels You are unleashed into the full skill tree with barely any knowledge of what you should do Make no mistake  you will spend about half your time playing this game poring over the treesthe wikistrying to figure out combinations and what works bestparticularly if youve not played this type of ARPG before That IS part of the gameand can be enjoyable in its own rightbut to begin withits extremely confusing The first time I saw the Devotion systema series of additional perks and stat bonuses on top of your regular progressionconstructed as a kind of astral mazemy reaction was WHY IS THIS NECESSARYI can still honestly say that something similar to Devotion but without the brainfuck could easily be achieved In that respectGrim Dawn is almost complexity for the sake of complexity Its the antithesis to the design philosophy of the new Diablo 3and its easy to see why the fans are so vigorously vocal about that  its almost a political statement about the way games are designed But you could also make a strong argument that learning and navigating that maze  like the skill system  is part of the game itself and its lasting appeal Whether or not that appeals to you will be entirely a matter of tasteDiablo 3but honestly its a very minor complaint It still feels fun to play for long monstersmashing sessionsbut more in the sense of watching your progression and XP climb it just lacks the visceral appeal and feedback of a true AAA action game But the devs have done a pretty fantastic job nonethelessand I still find it more satisfying than some of the floatier action games like Yakuza Whats morethey continue to improve the first expansionAshes of Malmouthintroduced the Inquisitor masterywhich feels very suited to running and gunning In the second expansionForgotten Godstheyve added a huge number of movement abilities like teleportsdashes and leapsenhancing that allimportant action element to this actionrpgnonethelessto watch my faction reputation climb and unlock new rewards and on the opposite sidethe hatred of my enemies climb until they began sending their nemesis hitmonsters after me Its an optional element to the campaignbut after the story is over youll find yourself coming back to grind out reputation and unlock the essential augmentations that factions will offer The systems all feed symbiotically into each otherbuilding the ideal breadcrumb trail of gameplay so that you will never run out of things to do  at least not until you have a couple of hundred hours on a character But if you like this gameyou will certainly get addicted to creating new charactersplaying with new masteries and buildswith just enough suspense and intrigue packed into every dropped note to make you eager to find the next one Youll want to find every secret of the worldand the devs have been devious in hiding them The main story is not quite as goodbut thats not what I want from a game like this I want it to feel like a gamenot a film For thatthis emergent and bitty style of storytelling is perfectand keeps you interested without interrupting the precious gameplayloot Unfortunately I found the loot in this game to be far too numerousdropping piles of crap and forcing you to play Inventory Management Simulator 3 every 5 minutes in the early game This lessens as the game progresses and you unlock more bags to hold stuffand as your gear becomes fairly good I also began using the loot filter to simply ignore the lowest three tiers of loot trashnormal and magicalopting only for rares and abovewhich made me feel like I was throwing away a lot of money and potential gear upgradesbut simply made the game less tedious and more fun This is improved in Forgotten Godswhich introduces a more complex loot filter so that youll only see gear that pertains to your particular character type  no more having to sort through manually Far better late than neverthen youve probably got a good idea of whether or not Grim Dawn is for you Despite my criticisms hereIve had a blast playing Grim Dawn and consider it to be the best ARPG on the market right now If its what youre craving  youll not find better than thisHave you been diagnosed with Diablo Disappointment Disorder Stage 3greeddepressionaddictionmicrotransaction transmitted diseasesthere will be more content addedfriendsor family have any addiction problems relating around fun arpg adventures before you make your decisionInDepth Reviewespecially the 3 swamps in act  and arkoviabroken hills in act 2 I was told that the devs are planning to rework some of these areas though in terms of visualsfun combatjust as you would expect from an ARPG The constitution system makes sure that you dont just wait to regenerate and the scarcity of potions underlines the fact that you are survivor of a perished world Unlike Diablo 3 leveling feels rewarding and presents you with relevant decisions that influence your progression later in the game The dualmastery system of Titan Quest opens up a ton of possibilities and will further improve the more classes are available The locational damage will probably not suprise TQveteransbut for ARPGs in general its a really noteworthy feature that adds further depth to the game On a site note There is an existing faction system that will be dramatically improved in the upcoming buildunfortunately the damage monster deal is also scaled if you play together Resistances dont show much effect if they are not pushed quite high and casts and even aoe skills can miss enemies Coming from WoW I was never very fond of a accuracy stat as it pretty much forces players to cap itskill bonusesdamage modifiersresistsetc etc This and the fact that there are procs and even entire new skills on items massively increases the number of possible builds and the fun collecting every item Unlike other games in the genre there are not only random rolled yellows and greens but also static epic items which helps to reduce bad lucklegendary items will drop from 5 onwardbut are not available yet Like Titan Quest there is also a huge number of augmentations to further personalize your gear The two unqiue blacksmiths to choose from make use of these augmentations to craft a bunch of new items and relics from blueprints found in the world All items are fully tradeable with other playerswhich makes it highly customizable The data sheets are well categorized and easy to accesssome of which only offer vague informationeg Solaels Witchfire  what exactly do the st and 2nd rune increase You will have to try that out for yourselfbut it already has act 3 which offer fairly much to do and even on the second playthough reveal some suprises Hallowed HillDepraved Sanctuary and Steps of Torment provide some lasting endgame contentthe latter even comes with a cohesive and interesting story Due to the fact that the current maximum level is 4 the number of build possibilites is limited of coursenontheless there is plenty of them already Id say theres roughly 52h of playtime right now if you dont try the more fancy buildshere are the most prevalent onesboth hostile and friendlyespecially annoying with epicsbrilliantly handcrafted world that sometimes feels repetitive because of the lack of different texturesdiverse builds and multilayered mechanics with only minor problems here and theremany optionsbut sometimes useless skillitem descriptionslikely 52hvery polished for an alphathe graphics and audio help create a unique atmosphere that supports the many stories you find about the world of Cairn and its residents It may take some time though to see through the complexity of the skill tree and items and appreciate the thought that has gone into it All in all Id say that Grim Dawn even in its currents state is worth every penny as it not only offers the usal ARPG featuresbut also comes with its own fresh ideas and shows promise of even moreShort summaryTorchlight and Titan Quest The Titan Quest influence is especially strong since many of the devs at Crate also worked on Titan Quest Typical of ARPGsgameplay revolves around clicking monsters to deathcollecting lootand allocating points to give your character skills and abilities The game has a lot of content and is well worth the purchase price of the base game and expansionsup to the subsequent expansions The thing that really separates this game from other ARPGs on the market is the sheer amount of customization available to the player The class system works by combining two masteries on a single character Each mastery has its own skill tree and is suited to a particular playstyle For examplethe Nightblade mastery is suited to a dual wield melee playstylewhile Arcanist is suited to a more traditional caster playstyle If you were to select both classes at onceyour class would become a Spellbreaker and you would have access to both Nightblade and Arcanist skill trees at the same time Each mastery has a certain amount of overlap with othersso its possible to create a caster character even if one of your masteries is more melee suited As of the latest expansionthere are 36 class combinations available and all classes have at least one if not more viable builds at endgamefurther constellations are unlocked based on similar affinities to othersplayers also have access to components and augments to further customize their characters Components serve the same functions as gemsrunes in Diablo 2 They are attached to armor directly and can grant stat boostsresistances and even skills depending on the component Augments are an additional attachment for items sold by reputation vendors and provide further stat bonuses There are a large number of factions in Grim Dawn and they operate on a reputation system very similar to what is found in an MMOits also possible to create a very weak character by allocating points in the wrong abilities On top of thatGrim Dawn has a large number of damage types and resistances In generaleach damage element will also have a corresponding damage over time componentwhich means that itemization at high level can be a difficult balancing act For exampleequipping an item granting a bonus to Cold damage will not boost Frostburn damagesince they are separate stats Howeverequipping an item granting Cold resist will also increase Frostburn resistanceso theres some minor inconsistency in how the damageresistance systems work OverallI think the game has a lot of appeal to players who really enjoy deep customization systems but that same amount of customization could also turn away players looking for more of a straightforward itemization system ie Diablo 3Grim Dawn takes place in the world of Cairna realm that has been forever shattered by the invasion of the transdimensional Aetherials The game does a fairly good job at world building and the main plot gives players enough information to understand why they are running from point A to point B A large portion of the game lore is contained in lore notes and books found throughout the game world Some players will like this method of storytelling while others may wish for more of the plot to be spelled out during the main quest section I think the overall story is passable but isnt overly outstandingId recommend Grim Dawn to anybody who enjoys ARPGs with deep customization systems and a wide variety of systems I think the sheer amount of game systems may be overwhelming to those who arent as familiar with ARPG style gameshowever veterans of the genre will find plenty to like Grim Dawn is also supported by an excellent community over at the Crate forumswhich should be your first stop to learn more about the game mechanics in detailAt first this game seemed like one of those Diablo copies But as I played through itseveral positives that other similar ARGPs dont have become clearyou start out with all options open and you can choose from a big variation of offensive and defensive skillsyou can start investing points in another class skill treeallowing you to mix with even more offensivedefensive skills from that other classbut also generic in a good sense Flat bonuses to whatever type of damage your character deals are widely availableor use them in the extensive crafting system They can be somewhat compared to socketable gems or runes in Diablo 2but every item has a socketbut for those who played Path of Exile and were thrown off by the clunky gameplay I know I was will have a much cleaner feel of gameplay flow in Grim dawn that is almost similar to Diablo 3 You character feels very responsive to your actions and he goes where you want him to goand Grim Dawn does a good job at it The minimapmap and color scheme are all clear enough to see I am rg colorblindGD is a very enjoyable multiplayer experience You can easily build characters that complement each otheror slaughter each other in a duelthis is good Not like Diablo 3 where everyingthing is soulbound Some items in Grim Dawn are also soulboundbut with reasonwhich is not for the casual player I put this as a negative and positive on purposeas this is a matter of tasteCunning or Spirit Physique gives hp and other health bonusesCunning gives crit and hit bonuses and Spirit gives more energy to spam your skills It SEEMS like a choice at firstbut because items REQUIRE flat amounts of these stats 75 Spirit for that great caster item75 Physique for that awesome armor this choice is an illusion In factthis can be very frustrating for a first playthrough you might not be able to wear something awesome you find Diablo 3 doesnt have this problem but many otherswith 3 Wind Devils3 Storm Totems Wendigo Totem and 4 packs of monsters can give lageven on the best of machines This is not any worse than on similar games like D3 or PoEthe experience needed to advance increases rapidly per level Reaching max level on a character is an everyday2 week investment at leasthosting a game in GD requires you to manually open port 276 UDPTCP Although this is easy for meit may not be for those less technically inclinedwhich is not for the casual player I put this as a negative and positive on purposeas this is a matter of tasteThis is an action rpg which everyone will love I will try to breakdown the main points as quick as possibleno major changes or innovations on this sectorthe character

hours into  Its good  Its fun Its replayable Hopefully that much is obviousresistancesdifficulty spikes  They arent here to hold your handand if you venture into hardcore you will ultimately diethis is a master pieceAs a veteran player of aRPGsI want to share my feels about Grim Dawn with youafter about 9h of gameplaydark storyaguments and itemgranted skills which provide wide variety of buildsbut I am sure its veryvery fun instanced or FFA lootcombat with friendsetcreasonable travel systemplaces and secret questsits definitely great with 6 various classes at the momenthowever I think theyre not necessary hereNPCs and major bosses names5ibGrim Dawn is one of the most richly detailed and beutifully sculpted unfinished game Ive ever played Its definitely one to keep your eye onPath of ExileTorchlightVan Helsing  countless others HellIve even made a career out of making YouTube videos for them Grim Dawn was little more than a curiosity to me when I first checked it out in the Alpha But since then I have repeatedly come back to it whenever a new build is released and each time I play it I fall a little more in love with itI wouldnt expect a launch this yearbut the quality of updates has been phenomenal The devs at Crate have their finger of the pulse of the community and have a very clear vision for the game they want to make  its the game they want to play I recently spoke to Mediera one of the developers and he said that he barely even played Titan Quest when he was developing it  but while developing Grim Dawn he can barely tear himself away from itwith s of hours spent playtestingwith some of the developers that originally worked on the game now making up the indie dev team at Crate Entertainment The game is built on a heavily modified version of the same engine Titan Quest was built on Youll notice the similarities between the games if youre a fan But this game is not Titan Quest reskinned  its a much better game in my opinion Its taken some of the best features and mechanics from that gameput them into an immersive postapocalyptic world and expanded themin interesting wayshbHighly recommendedbhvery littleI am not one of them since this is actually my very first aRPG that has made me play it for more then 5 hoursthe last one made it possible to use and create mods I will talk more of MODS laterthis is the Insane dificulty When you finish Elite you will unlock Ultimate dificultythis is the hardest dificulty the game has to offer for DD playersthis is NM Difficultythere is a lot of lootannoyingly so it seems when you first start the game What is important to know is that in normalveteranthe pieces you findarent that good The good pieces start to drop around level 5 when you will also get your first legendary loot when you finish the gamesome may give you extra damageor more resists or even extra skills that you put on your skillbar This is an important part of your build This game isnt easy for a scrub like memy first hero that I created demolistshaman has more than 3 deaths to his sorry ass name I blame him and not me you can find them in his play listthe workshop is NOT availableyou must create a folder in the games directory main named MODS duh and put the mods in this directory I will put a link to the website of crate belowI HIGHLY recommend Davoods DAIL mod because he incorperates all the best mods available endless waves like in Diablo 3new classeshigher masteriesbar up to level and so on and on and onplain and simpleToo  Reasons to play Grim Dawnthe evil is deep rooted and you a person who just escaped death with nothing to lose but tons to gain is out to see that this is evil is brought downgroup or personsin addition these notes also give a good amount of XP and is a great way to push you to the next leveltake PoE for example In PoE you are moving so fast and attacking even faster that monsters and never really have a chance to react because they are already dead While its not a bad thingit does take away the difficulty from the game itselfwhich increases the difficulty and while you gear up and get strongermonsters will destroy you so be wary of running in and expecting to mop the floor I feel this makes the game more challenging and not so run and lootas it really makes you focus on cool downs and strategize your attacksas well as when to disengage and reengage in combatbecause once you beat the game what is there to keep you coming back I feel Grim Dawn provides the most versatile end game content out of the many ARPGsthis is party of the reputation systemso not only are you gaining rep helping the good guys You are also gaining bad rep by defeating the evil factions Once your reach nemesis rank for a specific factionthen these enemies will start spawning in the world to give a unique challengethere are Super Bosses These bosses are hardest in the game and will require your build and gear to be at its best to beat them and will drop interesting and good gearget devotion points and grab some gear before you start the main game But the crucible is really a horde moodand at high level you go through  rounds to try to get to level 5 Once you beat each round you can end the crucible to earn your rewardsyou you talk the NPC to collect rewards and leave The higher the levels you reach the better the rewardsThe main reason we play games like this Grim Dawn as something that many looters are missing these days and thats loot tables aka Targeted Farming Many ARPGs these days rely heavily on casino based loot mechanics to do things a little differently and keep players engaged rerunning content over and over again to get the loot with the exact stats they needor they will allow to reroll stats a certain amount triesthe game also offers targeted farmingthis means certain bosses will have a loot table of specific gear that has a percentage to drop This will allow to farm bosses to get the exact item you need for your buildwithout having to worry about reroll on statsdevotion pointsgearcomponentsand augmentsand resistancesyoull need to learn how to scale your character correctly to beat some of the hardest content With resistances not only do you need to be correctly scaled for fightsyou can also play as any of the resistances which makes the game interesting with the many different builds Many of the different abilities have Damage Over Time DOT which can also scale with the rest of your buildyou also have mastery levelsyes the two masteries must be leveled upwhich also have x amount of levels Masteries will also increase statsand damage so its important to level these up Theres a total of 248 points you can spend in game 237 from leveling  from quests You will also receive one stat point per level to increase physiquecunning and spirit If you are not happy with your buildyou can speak to an NPC to respec for minor currency Check out grim tools in the comments to use this site to plan your buildsyou will need to cleanse corrupted shrines throughout the world Once you interact with the shrineyou will need to either fight a wave of enemies or provide an item to the shrine These as well can be respeced for minor currency if you are not happy with your choicesfriendly and the staff is very engaged in their forums If youre into trading and need help crafting high end items the Grim Dawn forums is a great place to go and engage with the communityenemies to fightitems to loot The game is not meant to be rushed Sit back and enjoyYou see Im a very poor man I had acquired this game through alternative methods After playing this game for almost  hoursI decided to skip lunch for a couple of days in order to buy this game here I cant emphasize this enough THIS GAME IS BRILLIANTWhen Early Access Surprises youGrim Dawn started out as a buggy Diablo clone whos title was too edgy to take seriously I gave it a shot initially hating itbeing upset at every little thing that made it different from the rest of the haphazard Diabloesque games that have dotted the market since then I thought it was simply another crash grab from the team that brought us the underrated yesI still think so Titan Quest as was the norm to do when the project startedstellar combataddictive character buildingoozing puddles of loot amongst amazing level designGrim Dawn has set the bar very high for me Ontop of the recent expansion Crate delivers constant patches and updates to fix bugsexploits and to balance many aspects of the game even while a new expansion loomsaffordable addition that is a very fun way to play Grim Dawn and prove your mettle That saidmy gripe with Grim Dawn has always beenthe sound While the sound effects are generally very well doneI feel during the push to gold statusthe voice acting and the music fell behind The soundtrack isnt badits just lackluster where I would want it more extremeit sort of falls to the wayside of the endless monster slaying The voice acting can either be superb John Bourbonwildly inconsistent Some Ulgrim lines are practically deadpan to just plain cringeinducing A few Inquisitor Creed linesthis is absolutely worth the money and timemake some friends on their excellent forums the community is stellar and helpful with a healthy amount of showboatingbuy a copy with a friend or two since these games are really at their best when shared with a friend Howeverby no means is it worth less single playerWell here I scored over 2 hours for the meager pricetag of 3 something Euros in this gameso I conclude it deserves a bit of written gratification This is a best ARPG I ever played in my life and Im balls deep confident there is nothing better on the horizont for at least 5 years ahead of us unless Lost Ark makes itwhich I doubt What have I played in my life you ask Well everything since the demo of Diablo  in 995so you can kinda trust meit actually has a story which is merciless and brutal It offers 8 masteries2 of them you can combine as you pleaseeach of them bearing a crapton of skills and abilities for you to play with The progression system in this game allows to create any character you can possibly dream of NecromancerHoly warriorUnholy warriorArcane roguezillion of various mageshard hittersdotersfreezerslife suckersThorCapt America  you can imagine itits herethe Devotion systemwhich is a completely separate layer of progression allowing for you to obtain unique buffs and even powerful proc skillsThere is an absolute shitton of items which will remind of the good old loot hunt as the game doesnt even try to accomodate tech heresy called smart lootso you will loot and get all the epic items that are totally useless for your current buildbut will instantly make you want to play something else thus ending up in a 25 thousand hours long cycle of character rerolling as I didbut not copy pastedto D3 greater rifts If the 8 classes and 56 combinations available to you are not enoughthere are tons of mods increasing the number of avaiable classes all the way up to whooping 4 GD is superpolishedalready received several DLCs and myriad of bug fixes and content patchesbut step none the lesstowards such an objectiveso go and buy will ya The time to play and discover for yourself is nowI already mentioned it Anywaysmemory practicePros  Rough around the edgesbut still an excellent value    If you loved DiabloTorchlight Titan Quest then this is the game for you    Combat is solidthe story is well presentedmonster design is top notch   Spiffy animations   Art direction takes a few cues from Fallout 3  Borderlands    A few shout outs to HP Lovecraft    No crashes for me  almost no bugs    Very stable gamebut it is getting better    Crate employees are swell  willing to listen to feedback   Crate fans on the other hand     Welllets just say they are a bit defensive    Saying that there are flaws with Grim Dawn is tantamount to calling their baby ugly    The Crate Forums are going to be very interesting when the final product shipslow fantasy that doesnt pull any punches    Some of the game design choices are real headscratchersbut theyre being ironed out     Crate entertainment is a pretty decent indie outfit   deserve support   Its a work in progress that takes you on funbrutal journey    8 out of Above average   B   Four Stars out of FiveAfter logging 657 hours of the gameand plan to continue to log some more hours into the game I feel like Ive played it enough to give a pretty good reviewits not as face paced as what you would see or come to expect from a game like Path of Exilebut it flows well Theres more of an emphasis on doing the bosses mechanically well than just clearing the content with brute force Obviously if you want to create a build that can brute force all content in the game and not have to worry about things such as mechanicsyou can There are a healthy amount of options you can explore with your class combinations and gear combinations that will lead to hours of enjoyment for most peopleand a fairly active build community on the forums The endgame dungeonsthe crucibleand the Shattered Realms SR Ive found to be very fun and engaging Your first build may not be able to roflstomp all of the contentbut the way the dungeons are set up are hard but fair The bosses WILL kill you if you stand in the fire and you arent playing the OP I can stand in shit if I want to buildbut most of the mechanics that will kill you are avoidable The Crucible is a wave defense that goes for 7 at maximum rounds that get progressively harder and harderand the rewards get better and better Youre even allowed to make the Crucible more difficult by adding another spawner for mobsand you get a pretty good reward for taking the added risk Endgame is solidthe story if youre into that Ive heard is pretty good The game is definitely worth picking up and trying if youre a fan of ARPGsthe game does give me a headache from time to time with the crafting system thats in place The way its designed is fineyou kill a bossopen a chestyou get a blueprint Easy enough The problem comes in with the sheer amount of blueprints available in the gameand the way the rolls are checked for a blueprint you dont have yet After 65 hours of playI still dont have all of the blueprints and its not for a lack of trying In the endgamecachescrucible chestsand SR chests roll  times to check for a blueprint you dont have This is really good at the start of the gamebut as you collect more and more blueprintsthe chances of you getting a new one gets lowerand lower Leading to some very frustrating feeling of wanting to try a build with a certain crafted itembut being unable to craft said item This forces you to either ask a friend to craft it for youor find someone in the multiplayer sectioncommunity discord that can And if youre like me that tries to do everything you possibly can without the assistance of othersit can really start to take away from your enjoyment of the game when youre blueballed for Blueprint dropsI find the game super funand would encourage people to at least try it out If anything it sho
1,Wowlet me just start off by sayingI really dont care at all for the MyCareerMyTeam aspects of this anymore thanks to 2K monetizing it and making it grindy not to mention the cringeworthy storylines and dialog My bread and butter is really MyGM mode MyLeague would be my preferred optionexcept every 2K for the last several years has bareboned MyLeague in favor of MyGMleaving out crucial features like morale changes I benched Russ the entire first half of this season to test for instanceand his morale didnt drop one bit in MyLeaguenot to mention other features such as badges on staff and other aspects So reallythere is no perfect mode for methanks to how 2K has broken these modes apartso the last several years Ive been playing MyGMbecause with all its flawsits still at the best experience available unfortunately 2K19s MyGM was actually fairly decentit gave us most of the options available in MyLeaguewhile still retaining its own feel It was fine Apparently that wasnt going to fly with 2Knot anymorewelleven though its unrealisticyoure stuck with it You can no longer designate a player as a playmaker in the edit settings You can no longer edit their accessories You can no longer do ANYTHING we could previously do in those settings in other iterations  its totally gone I get removing the ability to edit other teams playersadmittedly there were ways to really cheese the system last yearsuch as changing other teams players that you wanted to crazy positions like Andre Drummond as a PG in order to make them tradeableso if they had removed the ability to edit other teams playersI would be ok with that But you are telling me as a GMI cant change the positions of my own players to evolve with my team Whatyou can no longer use a custom roster anymore HonestlyI wouldnt care much about this personallythe only reason I use it is because 2K still lists KD as 9despite the fact he is clearly not and has admitted so himselfso it looks goofy seeing him next to Giannis who is 2 taller than him in the gameeven though they are the same height in real lifeanother HUGE missing featureis that I can no longer set the quarter lengthor sim the games I play to have realistic minutes and statsso now everything is off if I decide to play my own games which if you dontwhat is even the point of playing Why was this removed It makes no damn sense We can no longer make any other difficulty editsother than a generic and totally vague and unhelpful option to select an easymediumor hard difficulty at the beginningand thats itand it still makes no sensebut I can already tell its awful Apparentlyyou have to do something every single day if you want to be able to even play a game  I cant even just fucking select a game to play on the calendar anymoreit wont let me I have to do BS tasks and other things each day just to advance The NBA season is long I dont want to literally do hundreds of things that are mostly meaningless every season just to be able to play games I want to playand I may come back and edit this as I rememberdiscover moreto the point that it is pretty much unplayable Againnone of this would be an issue if MyLeague were given the same basic features and systems that MyGM hassuch as working player moralecoaching badgesa feeling that players actually care what you doetcbut that has been neglected for years by 2K I suspect its because they want people playing only modes which include options to spend VCand if you can customize the game mode to make the league how you want ithow are they going to get money out of youbut I may legit ask for a refund I keep asking myself why throughout my experience with this game MyGM was fixed and fine last yearWHY did they strip it down and make it so restrictive Restrictive and prohibitive is the best way to describe itand then just grab it that way I dont care for any of the online BS because its already been turned into a grindfest in order to milk money out of people for a game they already paid forso in my eyes 2K did this to themselves What a gross and disgusting companyas I saw a few other people mentionthis is literally such a copypaste of 2K19that as of this momentthe icon in the task bar when its running still shows the 2K19 version LMAOIts pretty gooda couple of new thingsbut mostly copied from last yearthats pretty sadThis is not a gameplay review Im gonna try to be as brief as possibleI am a LONG time basketball game playeractually since these things exist Ive seen everything Yetive never seen anything like Nba 2k On one hand youve got a solid base game with an enormous amount of content and potential The gameplay is actually the most solid its been in yearseven the story in my career is by far the least cringey ive ever seen The graphics could though really use a new engineas this ones been showing signs of old age for quite some time  But on the other handyouve got a publisher who literally doesnt give a single f about the users The game is riddled with bugs that have been there for years and havent gotten addressedtheyre still the single most greedy gaming publisher in the world with the pay to play mechanics of the Virtual currencybut THE ABSOLUTELY WORST part of it allor how experienced you are or how smart you are They will own you And the fact that 2k doesnt care about thator hasnt done anything AT ALL over the years to stop thisis by far the most low experience from any company in the industry i have ever experienced 2k is the worst of the gaming industry that has ever existed They are hurting the industrythe playersand everything around themexcept their bank balance Now to tell people to stop buying it is not enoughbecause it wont happensince theres too many people who LOVE the game of basketball But TO ABUSE THIS LOVE FOR THE GAME in this kind of manner should be punishable byi dunnoprison for life if you ask me I wont tell you to stay away I will tell you that this kind of practice has to be stopped in its tracks Its abusivemonopolisticunethical and just plain disgustingshows as NBA2K19 icon in task bar thinkingUNSKIPPABLE ADVERTISEMENTS IN A  GAMEGarbage copy paste of NBA2K19 with more microtransactionstrash ass companyI aint really gonna say anythingI just want to give thumbs down to this game becausewellbecause fk this scriptfest manipulative bs so called NBA 2K2 designed to milk you outta your every single penny As somebody said2K might be even worse than EA And thats somethingI stand corrected Ive never been dissapointed so much with a game I wasnt sure if Im sadangrydisgustedor just wanted to vomit 2K certainly did tremendous job in comparision what is EA doing with Madden I really have to admit itThese motherfuckers actually put unskippable ads in the loading screenSo first offIm a fool for buying the game this year No way around iti still see the same issues that the last few editions had Lets name a fewinto the exact same thing without the names Theres literally no differenceexcept instead of sharpshooterslasherdefenderetcyou now have pie charts that does the exact same thinghave a watered down version that either doesnt know how to finish at the rimshoot 3spost up or have a ball handling stat that will enable you to go by terrible defenders Chose 2and forget all about defence3pt and finishing at the rim You cant have all 3so the game will fault you for itthis year you only get the storied version that nobody liked in 2k19we all knew this was gonna be the game 1 step forward 1 step back Of course if you expect any focus on online play and hackerswell youre as big an idiot as i wasbut I wont be buying 2k games for a few yearsbut i somehow fell for their marketing tricks and decided to give them 1 last chance And holy fuck do i regret doing soproduced by a trash production teamand ive encountered so many other issuesthat i think i need to keep going with this Bear in mind that these are all bugs that were in previous years editions tooits about 55 if itll count as a turnover or not Doesnt matter if they actually had control over the ball or notdespite not having a single attribute above 7and alot of my attributes being below 5 So this year were able to play as the most overrated NBA star to ever grace the earth Thanks 2Kyou sure know how to give people what they wantsince hes now in the mid s on open 3 pointersand high 5s on open midrange shots Of course we all know lower body injuries fuck with your handshe takes the jumper and of course misses He might honestly be the worst player in the game right nowconsidering his stats vs tendenciesand despite it being fully supported on the PS4its still not fully supported on PC The game tells me to pass by pressing A despite my controller not having any AsThis game sucksif you pass them the ball in the paint they will take the ugliest most contested shot right away with like 15 seconds left on the shot clock This would be fine if they were like 8 overall but we are talking about the Player thats on the cover of your game They refuse to add more features and or fix anything I understand that career mode is not as profitable but this company make an insane amount of cash on this game and as consumers we deserve a better productCancerous microtransactionssimilar to mobile games You know how in Youtubeyou cant skip ads for 5 seconds in every matchtheres an unskippable for 5 seconds Gatorade commercial everytime your team takes a timeout I do not recommend this game to anyone Please stop supporting these kinds of developersDO NOT BUY  DO NOT BUY  DO NOT BUYconsidering this is steamusing controllers  But sorryonly for console playersProsbut theres no competition No competition has led tothough oftenIll play offline Wait TheresI dont have a gambling addiction Good thing 2k can still pull money out of you throughyouve killed the captain I cant wait for your ship to sinkI got this for freeand 2K should pay me back for wasting bandwith to download itWhy is there basketball in my casinoCasino simulator with basketball games as a side show Illegal and bad productwhere developers used false advertising to sell it Also selling gambling to kids is illegalTheres literally a 3 second unskippable Converse ad at the beginning of games1 Crashesthey didnt even change the icon It still says 2k19An almost exact copy of 2k19 If you take a gander at the icon in your bottom bar while the game is onyou will see even the icon is still 2k19 LOL these devs are so lazy and ridiculous Its a clone with a little polishbut as you can seeyou can polish a turd all you wantbut it will always still be a turdgambling scheme The Career is boringcrashes constantly and has no real risk or reward systemThis  game has ads in itenough said

1,Its gonna be the last one with Kimi nen sowhat are you waiting forfirst race I hadAI Hammilton pushed me out of the trackVery realisticmy first race on the game and Mazepin span off on the first lap  would recommendPros  Good  RealisticOverall great gamevery realistic mazepin never winsLast game with Kimi in it Why Mazespin not spinningGame is super realisticgot ahead of Hamilton and he pitted me into a wall going 8mphjust like real lifeGraphicsIve played F 22 before and F 22s AI and Damage Model is miles greater than F 22 In F 22the AI doesnt try to avoid you and their cars feel heavier than yours In F 22the AI is more aggressive and defensive with overtaking and actively avoids collisions Im playing on an Xbox controller with all assists off and Ive been having loads of funCodemasters have been making Formula  games since all the way back in 29but F 22 marks a new era for the franchise and its developers with the take over of the gaming industry giantEA Sports I think I have sufficient time in this game now 22 hours to say I can recommend itto an extentfirstly being the classic driver career modethis is what I buy these games for to enjoy a completely fictional F world where right now Max Verstappen is in a Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton has retired These career modes are the perfect racing RPG you get to chose who you arewhere you start and where you go with an ever evolving world around you The My Team mode adds to this with you being able to create a brand new team on the gridchose your second driver and the sponsors that will be displayed on your car Personally I do not enjoy this mode as I dont find it realisticbut I do see the appeal and lots of my friends enjoy itAI are the best evernot only being more confident and racing each other hard but also making mistakes whilst doing so which only adds to the immersiondespite these mistakes mainly being caused by the AI slamming on the throttle The cars in the game are regularly updated to mimic the real life counter parts and the brand new tracks Portimao and Imola have been added in the last few monthsI do feel they shouldve had this on release but it has kept the game more entertaining for me and made it more excitingwe also have Jeddah coming in to the game next month It is disappointing to hear that Istanbul nor Qatar will be added but I do understand as these were announced far to late in the year for Codemasters to have time to develop themthis is the brand new mode introduced this year and it really splits me On one hand you have a easy set of challenges that helps new comers get used to the physics of the game and find a difficulty theyre comfortable at On the other hand you have an incredibly bland and predictable story that you have to track these easy and boring challenges to only be rewarded with cutscene I think for people new to the series its a way for them to get accustomed to the game whilst well enjoying is too kind on what the story offers but it is made by a studio that doesnt tells storiesthey make racing games and I think for a first try its adequate but we have seen other studios in the past do a better job so I am expecting a lot better for next yearstill after a whole year we dont have any competence of a good livery editorwe still have some stupid presets that just look stupid and the only way to have good looking liveries is mod it in but you have to have the game on pc and have the dlc cars Something that makes this even more absurdis you have to pay for the majority of these presets that look like a 2 yearold just used ms paint for the first time I think it is ridiculous that a game you are charging people £5 for as a base priceyou then ask them to buy cosmetic items and shove your podium pass in their face every time they finish raceI dont like here is the new UI especially for RDit is incredibly unintuitive and does not explain itself well with all these big squares that take up your entire screen i do hope for next year they go back to the old RD tree It was far clearer and I dont entirely understand the reason for this change other than they wanted to show off some new assets of the parts you are developingweve had them back in Formula  games since 27 but now theyre gone There is no apparent reason why this choice was made as for last 3 years they just ported over the same cars from last years game Im too upset by this and dont think many people are as the classic cars werent the staple point for the series but it is a shame that theyre just gone and I really cannot think of a reason whyI have only spectated a few races where some have had horrible dsync but i believe this was down to the hosts bad internet People have had big issues with the curbs and them being too punishingIm not too fused about it I think some are a bit extreme but it forces you to not abuse track limits and use your car like some form of pizza cutterdespite what I say it is probably the best Formula  game ever madebut as always I do think £5 is too much for most games so either wait for a sale or find your own ways to get the game for a cheaper price If youre not willing to pay so much for this game I think F 22 is a completely sufficient game that has many features excluding Breaking Point and it has that lovely old RD treeHelps me forget about herThe realism in this game is insane Hamilton came down the inside of me and took me out the race He then preceded to win the race and run around like crazy and even stopped to do the L dance on my destroyed carHard to recommend I enjoyed F 22and this is just that game with the latest carsslightly updated graphics ray tracing etc and a story mode that I found funbut its about 5 hours of entertainment max The coop career mode is niceI enjoy racing with friends The racing is fun and close when difficulty is tunesand I enjoy the act of just driving around in this though some of the kerbs can get knottedand the attitude it shows Its even more egregious than F 22  its front and centrewith some more categories of items to dilute your experience further By default there are very limited customisation options even compared with F 22so you might be even more tempted to part with an extra  or so just to get the VIP pass On top of the  already spentwith EAs regional pricing making it far more expensive in some areas Thats just grubby Im fine with XP based unlocksbut paying for additional cosmetic items in a game like this is predatory and exploitativeand you are fortunate enough to have the disposable income I amand I didbut it doesnt feel like I got my moneys worth this yearto be honest mazespins out of Mazepin is a bit too fastI dont know what happened with the last patch but the game is unplayable for me nowput all the settings down to lowesttried reinstallingtried a new career Game still crashes I loved the game have a ton of time in it but now i cant play sucks a lot and until fixed i cannot recommend the game to anyonePlay online for the true Lewis Hamilton experienceget rammed off the track while the other person gets away like nothing happened at all

1,1 years and 8 hours later its still my favorite gameProof that content is superior to graphicsDO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS GAME Seriouslylook how many hours Ive played Over a thousandbut at least theyre hanging out with friends and collaborating Ive just been sitting here alone in my underwear in the dark bFOR 1 HOURSbhobbies and interests I used to cook for myself and clean my apartment once in a while I used to have ihouse plantsi for gods sakeif theres anything you value in lifedont buy this game Backbone of all combat oriented gamesbut both the developers and modders do an amazing job at making them look very goodIm doing itIm finally writing a review for my favorite game of all time before Bannerlord comes outnot even in its continuation in Bannerlord honestly If this game is not in your library with at least 1 hours on it you are doing yourself a very big disserviceAs a 78 year old gamerthis game has significantly improved the quality of my life after my wife died I have met so many friends in this game in the funny multiplayer games and conquered Calradia in singleplayer It does make me sad that there are not many gamers playing this game my agebut at least I get to interact with the youth againfor I am bound to a wheelchair for the rest of my life because of that factory accident I recommend this game to all agesas it is a very fun and enjoyable sandbox experienceStep 1  Create a character who is of common birthOkayI just actually read my own review and noticed its quite a lengthy piece of work If you are actually considering buying this gameId recommend actually reading this and other reviews that are of decent length because this game is not easily captured in just a few wordsno heroic destiny  you are not Dovahkiinthe fate of the world surprisingly does not rely on your actionsand noyou dont get a magical sword that will vanquish all enemies Now some people might find this to be a deterrentbut for a game as entertaining as Mount  Blade WarbandI only saw endless replay value Having put thousands of hours into both the original Mount  Blade as well as Warband both of which I originally did not buy on Steam I can assure you that if this game fits the genre of your preferenceyou can play it endlesslyyou can be a solo mercenary which is very very hardlead a group of mercenaries for a noblekingswear fealty to a king of a factionor attempt to become the king of your own faction RememberMB Warband is a sandbox game in which you can choose what you want to become Whatever story you feel like makingembrace it and become Butfor the most partit is a firstperson medieval combatbased campaign of a character trying to make his or her way in the world Yesthere are some tactics involvedyou can create your own little trade caravan and take over the marketyou can go around helping all the peasants in the worldand if you have a masochistic streakyou can attempt to work your way into the politics of the game which like politicsis frustrating Yetin the endit all comes down to fighting your way through lifebut nothing gamebreaking involving firstperson medieval combat on a battlefield that quite possibly may be strewn with horsespeoplecorpsesquite a few arrows and crossbow bolts mostly flying at you You have a variety of weapons to choosefrom a heavy siege crossbow to a throwing axe to a mere wooden staff to a glaive to a twohanded sword to you get the point Add all of this to being mounted on horses which have differing physical attributes for mounted combat and you have the chaos that constitutes a true battlefieldwhich allow you to actively use the terrain to your advantage or disadvantage It is very hard to siege a castle on the hardest difficulties because I meanwhen they are sitting on walls raining arrows on you but also very rewarding as you can then claim the castle and its revenue for your own My biggest issue with sieges is that for most citiescastlesyou are given a single laddersiege tower with which to conduct your siege infrequently you get 2of which yourtheir troops only use 1 No matter on which sidethis makes for siege defense quite practical when actually participating as every man on the wall is worth a hundred below it The combat simulatorwhich is activated when you dont feel like participating in the battle yourselfgenerally is very different from actual combat and tends to make defenders weaker than they actually are At the same timeyour troops will also not be getting orders from you and thus will be strategically weaker as wellfrom flight time to the drop from gravity to the sway of your horse to the angle of release to the point of impact on the enemy It is challengingrewardingand all together epic Id like to say more about the combatbut if I let my thoughts roam wild on this game we may be forced to deal with a book instead of a review So let me leave you with an image Picture yourself holding a shortbowmoving at a slow gallop on your horsefaced with fifty knights charging you with lances couchedcaravanskingsnoblesladiesand the odd adventurerhero who may be willing to join you Unlike the original MBWarband also offers you the option of recruiting vassals from other factions into your faction if you choose to start one This has made attempting to create a kingdom drastically easier since you no longer need to defend your territory alone from the might of five other kingdoms and their thousands upon thousands of troops The game also factors in your relationship to the NPCswhich can get very messy very quickly this is something you should definitely experience for yourselfas words dont really do it justiceWarband brings online multiplayer which though I personally did not partake in much of enhances the experience even morefeel free to leave a comment or contact me684 hours divided by 24 hours is 28 and a half days About a month With that monthI couldveYngolJacobZupers guidereview of Mount and Blade Warbandyou can litterally do anything you feel like doing in the small land of Calradia You can be a pirate raiding caravans from the six big factions Sarranid SultanateKingdom of VaegirKingdom of SwadiaKingdom of RhodoksKingdom of Nords and Khergit Khanate or you can join up with one of the factions or make your own one or just play as a mercenary Many people that look into the game for the first 5 hours think that this is a simple gamebut it is indeed pretty complicated which i will come to later in these 5 facts about why and how i have played 14 hours of this gameenjoy you will spend a minimum of 1 hours on itand once you get the hang of it you just want to play it 2 times again because you havent even tried a bit of the possibilitiesbut once you have tried the most it will get kinda booring but the next facts will fix that problemyou can always move to the multiplayer Note that MB has a very intense fighting system that requires you to play a bunch before you can actually feel like a good player But once you get the hang of itit is so much fun just to hack and slash through your enemiesfor some players it is just a slashblock gamebut its really much more than thatthere are loads of tricks to defeat the more experienced playersthere are loads of regiments and some in different languages There are pure SpanishGermanDanish etc speaking regimentsand i really hope that this makes you buy this wonderful game and play the living soul out of it Two words Modding Heaven This is probably one of the most modular games Ive ever playedwhich one Dont answerit doesnt mattertheres probably a mod for itor defending the World of Men in Lord of the Ringsor taking over the Empire from Star WarswaitOKthere arent any of thosewith even more being made every dayif you buy this and are open to modding your gameyou will never go another year without playing Warband Maybe a weekmaybe a few months but just when you think youre done with ityoull find another mod based on your favorite movie series popping up to pull you back inAfter 465 hours in game i finally had time to write this review  Its a great game if you care more about gameplay than graphicsit was a time when video games starts to become more casual And by 21 when MB Warband was releasedthere are basically two types of games left either its originally designed for casual gaming for consolesor it tries so hard on graphics to woo players that it basically rehash the gameplay Very few developers had tried to innovate how RPG should be created and playeddesigned on a already outofdate DirectX APIwith few lightings to impress the crowd I had ignored this game for 4 years before finally getting it And I never regretted sinceendless spawned enmeis for no reasonno sense of progression Mount and Blade series standed out as being the ONLY GAME since 21 that had acceptable graphicsdeep sense of RPG immersionand deep progression on all areas Leveling a character should be designed not only just to increase some integer numbers strengthagilitycharimsagoodnessevilnessand goldbut it should also take into account of the players actions Not in the sense bioware had tried lets just change some dialogs if goodness  evilnesssteal some cattleskeep ransoms for myself When I decided to start a kingdomI found out no one wanted to join my armyevery peasent charges obscene amount of gold for a simple swordand my kingdom lasted less than half a week It wasnt much latter I found out how being nice to people can be so rewarding in this game befriendly lords of good charactersmarry a nice lady and solidfy alliancejoin a faction and help out in wars in return for new land grantshelp villages and towns and it propspers to allow me to sell more at a higher pricemaintain good relations with village elders so I have a steady supply of new eager recruitswork on leadership skills to unify units under my command Once the king starts to get power hungry start a rebellionrecruit the good and friendly and allied lords to my causemanage garrisons and taxationslead a military campaign to crush the tyrantand then have than play the diplomatic and military game to conquer the whole ancient europe I can do them allthe gameplay on how you perform the actions are so difficult and rewarding The battles are absolutely unforgiving at higher settings The only tools I have to work with are my own hands and eyes Want to shoot the approaching band of armies Click the mouse and aim  except there is absolutely no aiming assistanceboth the enemies and my elite units are mounted And I only get one shot before having to spend  seconds to reload Melee kills while mounted also took some time to master I have to wait until they are precise at the position where if I extend my polearm nowat the end of my thrust it reaches precisely on the enemywhen to use rankswhen to hold and when to chargewhether to attack or to defend And when things start to go wellwhere to lay siege next When to start and when to end a military campaign so I can host feasts to improve morale and relations These are all hard questions we have to continue to contemplate in between individual battlesthe amazing combat gameplayand the rich RPG experience than this If you only have resource to play one RPG gameand you like medieval themesthen get thisJust leaving a goodbye to an old friendFor anyone wondering if they should get this game on the Summer Salea medieval sim so realistic that youre at a disadvantage for being a womanI play on the easiest difficultywhile I have an army of 6Became a mercenary for a kingdom A who was fighting Kingdom B Creates characterbut stays loyalFinallyafter 9 hours11 days4 levels and countless amount of dead warriors I became a King of Calradiiawho gathered a few soliders and was a servant for masters of guilds Through sellsword I served the lords in the strange kings wars for money and bread After many adventuresthe King Graveth saw in me potentialoffered new home and gave first village I was a faithful vassal who fought for the country and honor  to time in that King rejected me and gave my castle to another Prince  I betrayed and created my own fraction Together with old friends met in taverns I conquered the Rhodoks landbut It wasnt enoughI desired to be someone elsesomeone who will unite the Calradia FinallyIam sitting on the throne with my wife I ruleIam the Kingunder my feets  whole worldPossibly the best game Ive ever playedthat leverages a sandbox where factionskings and lords dynamically wage warsmake friendsforge alliancesetcso even if youre the king of a factionyou do things by actually traveling to places on the world map and speaking with people in the same veinin battlesyou dont give orders on a top down viewyoure actually in thereeither moving to safe positions with a good view to order your units aroundor actually leading a charge to the enemys flankand even though the way to achieve fame and fortune is very openendedgenerally speaking youll go through these  phasesfighting banditsselling loottrading between towns and recruiting peasants Eventually youll offer your services to some king which will make you a part of that factionif you prove yourself worthyyou can ask your king to become a lord and own landand from that point on youll start owning settlementsimproving themcollecting taxesyou may marry a daughter of some other lordyou will defend your land and your kingdom from its enemiesif your power grows to rival your kingdomsyou may decide to declare independence youll employ vassalsgiving them land and managing your relations with themand youll fight other factions for the recognition of your right to ruleuntil you eventually become recognized as another kingforging your own alliances and declaring your own warsprobably due to the sandbox and the way the game changes depending on what stage you are Alsoyou can choose very different playstyleslike a horse archer in oneor a knight in anotheror even concentrate on having great leadership skills and little fighting aptitude You can also decide to be a ruthlesscruel leaderor a honorablegood samaritanwhich will determine which lords and companions will put up with you Add to that some amazing mods that either expand or overhaul this fairly old gameand youll probably end up going back to it every so oftenlike I do
1,Call me slow but at 61 I can still learn and enjoy games like thisFirst off it is a great game after you get it linked to Steam If you buy on Steam here is the process to make it workgo to Third Party AccountsI am 6 years oldand really enjoy this game It has everything l like to doand as much as I want to do with it Not under any pressurebut still competitive under your own conditions I highly recommend this game Has so many things to doyou are never bored with itThis game is really quite goodand there is a lot to it The games flight mechanics are simple enough that they can be easily grasped and intuitively controlled faster than with most flight games Entering this gameyou should expect a learning curveand for part of the fun being exploring all the things you can do as you learn If youre expecting the game to tell you how to play beyond basic tutorials or what to do to experience the gameyoure going to blunder around for an hourrage quitand then feel the game lacks content and you were ripped off This game is a sandbox Be prepared to find your own way Lets get to the game itselftradingor exploration Lets talk about each of these three types of play in turneach which function differently and place different strains on your ships loadout You want to use Plasma Accelerators Wellthose have major power drainso you need your ship to have a large power plant Bigger shield More power Shield cell banks More power Planning out your ship for combat is a really enjoyableand ongoing experience throughout the game As far as combat goesyou can approach it as a bounty huntergoing out and hunting down people who have committed crimes to collect the bounty associated with bringing justice Or you can be a pirate and accrue a bounty on your head by tracking down other pilotsbreaking their shields and forcing their goods to be released for you to steal and sell on the black market Overallthis is an incredibly enjoyable part of the game If nothing elseyoull get a solid 030 hours out of combat progressionbut it really depends on what you look for Trading involves going to different stationsrecording what they have in high demandand what they have in high supplyand linking that up with other stations which can supply the high demandand which demand what the first station has in high supply In other wordsbasic supplydemand economicsyou trade the goods between stations This can be a bit dullother than when pirates are after youbut it really depends what you want This is the EuroTruck Simulator part of the game If you want something relaxingflying between stations while listening to a podcastaudiobookor watching a TV showtrading is for youthe galaxy is obviously massivebut theres a difference between that and truly realizing the sheer size of it all Solthat is the solar system earth is found inis a bit closer to the edge of the galaxy than the center It takes around 030 hours to reach the center of the galaxy in nonstop jumping from star to star To travel all around the galaxyyoure talking months worth of time devoted to exploring And that doesnt even count the time it takes to scan each systemand go around scanning planets to create data you can sell for money Why would anyone want to do this Wellhave you ever flown up to a black holeand seen the light distort around it in an eerieterrorizing sense of dread Have you ever seen a planet that due to gravitational force has been compressed into an oblong shape Have you ever seen a supermassive red giant star revolving around a black hole These are the types of things you see when you exploreand for manythe feeling of exploring and seeing these things is worthwhile If youre the first one to explore somethingyour name is also tagged to it forever The civilized area of space only takes about 500 LY around Solwith the rest up to being exploredwith a XBox 360 controllerand with most joysticks HOTAS or otherwise There are default bindings built into the game for the 360 controlleras well as most market joysticks So you wont have to worry about rebinding all that much while youre learningothers will bounty hunt for youetc You can set up wingsgroups of up to 4 pilots to do grouping fights Orif you want to be a recluseyou can play Solo and avoid other playersand just play with NPCs Or maybe you just want to play with your friendyou can set up a Private Group All of these require a constant internet connectionbut it is for a reason Anytime you do something in the gameit shapes the political and economic landscape If you buy resonating separators from Cemiessyou reduce the amount of supply in Cemiesswhich makes the price go up When this happensthe game pings the global serverand changes the value for everyone else in their own servers So although you are away from other playerswhat you do still impacts the galactic economy for everyoneFederationand Empire Additionallythere are Independent factions bound to specific star systems Each of these has control or lacks control over some stars systems Lets say you look at a system like Lugh which was ruled by the Federation Within Lughthere are many parties that are in governmentrunning for political control The Federation party is in control But if players start to do missions against the party in controlif they start to kill policepirate tradersdo things to disrupt the peace in that systemit spurs on civil unrest in the population of the system They start to demand change A civil war can break out between the faction in powerand the faction that is not in powerand they fight Players can get involved in assisting in these wars to earn combat bondsand help shape the outcome of the war Depending on which side winsthe system may flip In Lughthe system did flip Players turned out early on in mass numbers to test thistrying to flip Lugh from the Federation into an independent star system under the Crimson party This was accomplishedand Lugh is currently an independent star system as the Federation backed down Anytime you do a missionit pings the global server to say what the current influence levels are of the party So even if you play soloyou can impact global politicsyoull have some tutorials to teach you the basic maneuvers and travel of the gameand then youll be dropped into a dock in star system LHS 344 You wont get a quest promptthe game wont say Heygo here and do this Youll be docked at a space stationand it will be up to you to find out what it is you want to do You need to find your own way Youll blunder around and advance on your own termsyou should be prepared to blunder around for a little bit as you explore and learn more about the galaxy and how things work But the explorationthe learning of how things work is a lot of the fun This is an open world space gameand the way you experience it is something youll dictate for yourselfthere are a lot of different weapons and ships that make for a truly enjoyable experience Trading and Exploration offer great ways to still progress in the game while listening to audiobooksor watching TV showsUPDATE I last reviewed this at 500 hours played Guess Ive played it a bit more since thenand I still play whenever I can I love it Will you love it I will try my best to help you figure that out I see a ton of similar questions from new players and people thinking about getting into the gameso I will do this review in the style of a FAQcan I still get into it and catch uph1and will always bebecause the development cycle is long Arguablythe game is easier to get into nowthan it ever was beforeis this game fastpacedh1and more like preparing for a real space launch This game requires a lot of patience to get good atand enjoyand completely optionalis that trueh1compared to a lot of games Its challenging and can be very frustrating at first It took me five hours to figure out how to do very basic thingsand just as I was about to give upI figured it out This game requires a lot of patienceand also a ton of tutorials available on YouTube now This game will require you to spend a lot of time learning how to play  outside the gameand will not hold your hand You want to check out the subreddit relitedangerouswhere you will find guides in the sidebarand you are welcome to ask questions about the game There is a good wikiwhich answers a lot of questions There are 3rd party tools which help make the game easierthere are now Squardons guildsships which multiple players can manand missions designed for groups Lots of improvement in this area in the last couple of years There are also player groupswhich organize outside of the gameand play together ingameand everything else second Its a unique gamealbeit major updates only happen every once in a whileand only one major paid update has been released since launch Another big update is scheduled for 01introducing FPS combat and more yettobeannounced featuresafter you buy the gameor the expansionthe only things you can spend real money on are cosmetic upgrades to your shipwhich are 100 optionaland you cannot buy it with real world currencyis that trueh1and participated quite actively in the community for the last year If you respect the communityand respect the gamethe community will respect you Its that simple Reddit has a dedicated community with intelligent players who are open to helping new players with informationand the community is very active every day There are a few bad seeds You can also play soloavoiding people completelyis that trueh1and if you dont rushand dont try to do everything quickly and move onyou may find it a rewarding experience This game is not for completionistsbecause there is nothing to completeor some sort of guidance in the gameh1not really  not in the typical sense at least The story is in the background The game is a simulator and sandbox first This means you will want to set your own goals and your own direction This is not a style of game that everyone enjoysand thats okand do as little or as much of it as you want There is no endgamebecause the path is not guided and there is no ultimate goalhow can I aviod ith1which means you will never see other playersthereby completely avoiding griefing and player piracy This is NOW my preferred choice since its much more efficient for generating credits and Ive found that player interactions are rareand most of the time hostile If you enjoy PvPopen is the way to go You can switch back and forth between solo and open  the world with all the players in itat any timewith no penaltiesbut my opinion is that is doesnt You can pick this game up and put it downand pick it back up anytime I pick it up and put it down all the time  its very forgiving in that sense Since there is no story to follow jumping back in is always easyyou will spend the vast majority of the game in the cockpit of your ship A lot of the game is spent on traveldepending on what you choose to doso you will just be in your shipin spaceoften totally alonefor long periods of time Some people find this relaxingsome find it frustratingsome find it boringand others find it exciting Which of these applies to you is something you will discover for yourselfyou control it 100from flying out ofand landing inspace stations  to landing onand taking off from planets  to flying around asteroids You are completely in control of every aspect There is almost no hand holding and mistakes can be real and costlythe grind to get expensive ships is exponentially shorter than it was at launch What used to take months now takes a couple of weeks Even earning Elite highest possible rank in trading only takes a week or less if you dont mind mining  I find it tedious Some like thatsome hate it Definitely benefits newer players Addition of Engineering also made exploration much faster and easier by allowing players to significantly boost jump ranges of all shipsbut I absolutely love it There are big ups and big downsbut its a cool experience if you just stop worrying about endgame and what everyone else is doing Its been worth itfor meis that trueh1if you want to really get deep into itIf youve always wanted to explore

aweinspiringsometimes frustratingmassively underrated gembdo some research first  Heres my contribution for your considerationbut be assured the positives massively outweigh the negativesquicklyevereven after mastering the controls and ingame toolsnot an arcade game  The developers have gone to great lengths to make this a realistic simulation of being a commander of a ship in a future where humanity has FasterThanLight travel  This has two important consequences  1 Its complicated  there are a LOT of controls and modes to learnand the ingame tools have many optionsmany of which you will need to learn to be effective   Nothing is instantsay you just bought a new module at an orbital stationand want to go buy an even better one at another station a hundred light years away and thats a tiny distance by this games standards  Here are the basic stepsall of which occur in real time  there is no fast forwarddodging any interior structures or other craft that are leavingentering as you areuntil you gain enough distance that mass lock turns offchoose your destination systemand calculate a routewhich may involve moving around or away from obstacles to gain unobstructed lineofsightbeing careful not to get too close  After leaving a jump youre in supercruise mode where you can travel hundreds of times the speed of light down to thousands of kmsbut all that change in speed requires time  acceleration is not instantand is limited by the size and nearness of massive objects starsplanetsmoonsstationsso moving around stars between each jump will be a very common maneuver close enough to use a fuelscoop when you get one of thosebut not too close that you overheatto line up to your destination in the current systemcover the distanceand carefully decelerate when near your destination so you dont overshoot itsafe disengage  This will pop you out of supercruise within a small enough distance to your destination that you can cover the rest of the distance with normal spaceflight speeds averaging around 100 to 400 meters per seconddepending on your shipmodulesupgradespower allocationtonnage of cargoremaining fueletccontact the station and request docking  Do not attempt to enter the keyhole without permissionmake sure you are oriented correctly and gently descendusing the navigation panel to help you tweak your positioning  needs to be just right within a fairly small margin of error  the pad is barely larger than your shipenter the stationand use the station services  Again you will see and hear the landing pad retract into the systembuy itandif it uses a hard pointwatch as the old module retracts and is replaced on your shipthis is decidedly NOT a pickupandplay game  Againall of this is real timethere is no fast forwardno fast travel to avoid any part of this sequence  With a recent update you can get modules to enable supercruise assist and automatic dockingtakeoffbut this is only like partial autopilot of a realworld commercial airliner  it only lets you avoid having to do bsomeb of the above manually  It still occurs in real time and its a good idea to keep paying attentionas problems can occur that the autopilot cant handlejust like in real life  And step 1 is sometimes a long one  Just do a google search for Hutton Orbital and youll see what I meancomplexityuncompromising difficultyand exquisite attention to detail are just some of what I and many others absolutely bloveb about this gamespace tradingspace miningor space explorationrealistically simulated recreation of the entire Milky Way Galaxynonstop immersive sound designI must say again the game is worth itbut here is a warning for you anywaythough now it is one of his favorites and hes put in several hundred hoursand keyboard input starts malfunctioning  The easiestalways reliable way Ive found to solve this is to bind a joystick button to toggle camera view  A double tap of that button will solve any keyboard difficulty in my experienceavoid any massacre infected  missionsas you simply cannot complete them currently  You can usually just abandon these missions with no penaltywith little flaws that ultimately do not overshadow its incredible beauty and valueh1 Disclaimer h1it has a steep learning curve and many things are not explained to you ingame and require you to use external webtoolsread wikis and watch video guides This is not to say that its impossible to learn most of the mechanics and inner workings without thembut if you go in blindly expecting to grasp its mechanics all by yourselfyoull have a hard time With this being saidlets start with the reviewmany of which have tens or more planets There are many places to visitincluding famous star systems like Alpha CentauriSiriusCanis Majorisour solar system Soletc The engine that generates the galaxy gets a lot of its data from real world star cataloguesso most systems that are close to the players start are from real astronomical datawhile the vast majority of the rest is procedurally generated Other than planets and regular starsthere are black holesneutron starswhite dwarfs and nebulae to seeflying in this game is so satisfying and immersive Learning to fly is not difficultbut simply requires a bit of practice After a whileflying becomes second nature and youll see yourself docking and exiting stations all the while boosting and avoiding deadly collisions without dropping a sweat most of the time anyway Furthermorethe flight model offers a second modewhere the player has much more control over his ships movement but disables everything that the flight computer does to correct your rotation and trajectoryresulting is easy loss of control and unwanted spinning if the pilot doesnt understand what hes doing This is not something Id recommend for newcomersand even veterans unless they understand the benefits of itso stick with flightassist onits easy to learn but hard to masterdefences and utilitiesproviding the player with a decent selection of playstyles ranging from simple pulse lasers with unlimited ammo for prolonged fights to high hitting explosives and cannons that shred heavily armored ships at the cost of having limited ammunition Most weapons have three different versions that further reward players that play better The best performing weapons have to be aimed manuallywhile turreted and gimballed weapons offer less punchbut are much easier to use since they automatically track your targeteven the most skilled pilot in the most expensive ship can lose to a good pilot in a smaller less costly shipreally The freedom is both a gift and a curse of this gamesometimes you lack a direction to go and things to do because unlike other MMOs or games in generalthere isnt really a goal to this

missionsjoining the war effortpiracyfighting aliensspace truckingminingsmugglingdiscovering ancient ruinscrashed shipstaking tourists to far away placesnot in the traditional sense There are certain missions that factions can givebut most of them are procedurally generatedso they get stale after a while Not everything is tied to missionsyou are free to do whateverwheneverthere is nothing restricting you to any particular situation or areaif you decide to wander off during a mission you may do so Other than missionsthere are various events that happen in the gameand the whole galaxy follows a certain narrativewhere minor and major events take place and are usually told through the ingame news organization GalNet Which brings me to my next pointbackground simulationeconomic statuselectionsexpansionscivil warsoutbreaks and many more The BGS can be influenced by players by doing certain activities within that system For exampleif enough players in the same system fight for the side of one warring factionthey can change the tide and make that faction win the warchanging their status and potentially eliminating the other faction from the system Another example is if players trade a lotthe faction might change state into an economic boommaking it even more profitable to take missions and trade Player input is not requiredas states will organically change with time These state changes usually take a few daysbut can be accelerated with enough players contributing The BGS is something the average player can safely ignoreas its a pretty advanced topicjust understanding that factions can be in different states is enoughits a weird mix of multiplayer and singleplayer Simply putthere is one shared galaxy between all players on all platforms even consoles share the same galaxy as PC and three distinct playmodes openprivate groupsoloyou will never see another player directlyyou will see NPCsstationsasteroids and everything elsebut not playerseverything will be the same with the exception that you can see other players if they were at the exact same place as you i and i in the exact same private group This is usually used when you want to play with friends but want to avoid other playersyou can see anyone who is also in openthis is essentially one big shared private groupconsole players will always only see other console playersand PC players will only see PC playersand peer to peer connections There are no traditional serverswhich lowers the cost of hosting the game serversbut makes connecting with other players sometimes difficultespecially with dodgy routers that have strict NATs and firewalls These issues arent too commonbut can happen from time to timeespecially in openthere is a limit of how many players can be in the same instance its around 150 but can be worked aroundso a particularly popular place with 100 players will not have everyone see everyonebut rather have them split into 510 separate instances where each instance of 100 players can only directly interact within the same group of players Its not like the other players are ghostsits just that there are separate mini universes where different things happen at the same time independantlybut againcontribute to the same shared universeas its featuring many new mechanics and additions that only improve upon the gameif youre planning on exploring a lot landing on planetsor if youre into PvP and advanced combat aliens this is a must buy Read my review for the DLC urlhttpssteamcommunitycomidcookiesrtastyrecommended441340hereurlWhen I first played this gameit was not how I expected after watching so many live streams The game is relatively hard to play at first Unlike so many other gamesthis one doesnt hold your hand to help you through the session like a little kid I skipped the tutorial after a while because some of them were complete nonsense and hard as hell for what they give you If you ask meFrontier is not really good with that sort of thing You will eventually get destroyed a few times through the beginning due to various reasons It could be that you crashed into a staror you accidentally enabled silent running and you cooked yourself to death If you bought Horizonyou crashlanded on a planet You probably rammed into a station or got yourself stuck in the airlock somehow You got shot down for trespassing into a station without submitting a docking request first or you got attacked by a random player in openplay because they thought it would be fun to hunt a newbie Or you were carrying something a desperate

website and keep all your logs during your journeyand with the developers working hard to give us new content all the timethe game is still slowly evolving throughout the years The good thing about that is that it shows the developers care and listen to the community They will often do live streams to share news and content with their viewers They will often discuss new plans and changes for the game in their forums and open up polls to let the community decide what we want and if we agree with what they are about to do before making changes And I think that is what makes them amazingyou can have extra things like creating your character and changing your suitlanding on planetsgetting involved with the engineers to improve your ship in as many ways as possibledoing additional missions on planet surfaces and also owning one or multiple ships that are exclusively for the expansion Horizon was released a year later after the official release of the game and since then the developers keep on delivering free content for the community They still have dozens of plans for the game like the ability to walk around or to be able to land on atmospheric planets which are currently not possible at this time and a lot more features on their list to come if you visit WikiaI am sure you watched some videos or looked at a few screenshots but if you haventthe game truly has a breathtaking audio quality Having amazing graphic quality already is one thing but the sound effects of everything going on in this game can throw you off your seat Theres currently 31 ships in the game and a few new ships planned for the next update There are also 3 different fighter ships for those who have a fighter hangar in their ship which can be controlled by youyour friends or an AI to help you The game can be played in a solo sessiongroup and with your friends or in open session depending on your preferencesI believe thats pretty much it for now I think I covered the most important parts of this review If theres anything I am missingjust let me know and I will try to add it here Thank you for reading this review I hope it was worth your while Keep being awesome and have a fantastic dayHate people  Can play solo  1010Okayso I know a lot of people are probably wondering if this game is worth 30 dollarsbecause its super easy to earn money in the game by just jumping from star system to star system The more you discoverthe more money you earn when you sell your findings to the Universal Cartographics So I plotted a really long course from a system called Copian Xing to an area called Taurus Dark The name sounded really cool to meso I figured Id check it outI lost all of my fuel and I was on life support I was in deepDEEP spaceand there were no stations around me for eons of light yearsbecause I bought the economical life support systemCouldnt afford the 5 minute life support systemI looked up what happens when you run out of fuel in this game Then I got directed to a website called Fuelratsit prompted me to type in my commander namemy ingame locationand whether I was on life support I put in my infothen I was taken to a chat forum where REAL PLAYERS asked me about my situation They gave me some instructionsand before I knew ittwo players found me in the emptiness I was stranded in They gave me fueland directed me to the nearest starport It was still kinda far from my positionbut the fuel they gave me got me therewhere I bought a crucial item that every explorer needswhich you can use to harvest fuel from solar gas giants WITHOUT going to a starportthe community in this game is GREAT And even though I know that player pirates are out there somewheretheyre not as prevalent as NPC pirates Most players are just doing their jobs and having fun exploring this HUMONGOUS gameAnd at the time of me writing thisIve played 35 hours of thisand I havent even discovered a full 1 of whats out there But Im really excited to see everythingI was completely and utterly ALONE I didnt even have the comfort of the NPCs because they dont venture into places where starports arent present But you know who does THARGOIDSTaurus Dark is alien territoryso you better KNOW that I was on the verge of tears when I lost all of my fuel therewhich is a good thingbut thats how I got roped into leaving my game running for  hours straightdoing nothing but exploring and filling out courier missionsboth Players and NPCs You can do itand none of them are inaccessible from the very beginningbecause they go by a recommended skill level list If you do one of those mission types listed aboveyoull gain experience and a reputation from itwhich allows you to move forward in that careeror buy doing the same thing over and over again Its literally carving your path into the galaxyyou can buy new shipsand outfit them to meet the appropriate job conditions But just because you already have a shipdoesnt mean you have to give it upand pull out the one you need for the missionbecause it stays true to how unforgiving space can actually beyoull be hooked This game is a great time consumer as well as a peaceful getaway On a spiritual levelit makes you think about creation and how small we actually are compared to whats right above our Earthly problemsEarth is nowhere in this game I think we blew it up to kill the CoronavirusI just wanna point out that this game has a COMP
1,The fact that they have given PC users the last gen PS4XB1 version of the gamewhich means its lacking MANY new features that they advertisedis simply unforgivable They have dodged the question of Are you going to update the PC version eventually every time it is askedwhich to memeans No but we still want your moneyIve seen better effortstorymechanicsfeaturesgraphicssoundtracksand actors in pornThis is not the game being advertised on Steam  Within all the posts and news updates for this game on Steam these are just a few of the blatant fraud being committed by EA  and Valve with their false advertisementyou can assess your first half performancemake adjustments at halftimeand come out of the locker room better prepared for the second half”  Not on the PC version only Next Gen Consoles – You make depth chart changes the same as you did last game Madden 21 on the PCHowever this may just be EA Help not talking to EA Sportsthey are only in their MUT modethats on top of all the same bugs at the start of last years game Madden 21 with extra ones just for this yearall for the SAME price as the Next Gen Console Versionplayed the trialsame exact game as last year  definitely not worth spending money on  hopefully EA will lose their contract and some other developer will be able to step in and make a something worth buyingThis game is the football game equivalent of scratching a mosquito bite If you really need a football gamethis will scratch the itchbut its not a satisfying scratch Its the kind of scratch that leaves you wanting moreand the more you scratch itthe more annoyed you get I bought it since I simply had no option for a football gameand I will keep it because even though the itch is now an open bleeding woundI still feel compelled to scratch itbut I cant in good faith recommend anyone else do the sameMost usefull keys in this game Alt and F4pleeeeasedont miss your 2 hours limit for refund Next Gen MovementStatsand Graphics are major selling points for Madden 22 but are not available to PC usersCyberpunkFar Cryetcit makes this Madden 17 refresh feel stalethis game looks identical to Madden 21 on PCnot getting access to next gen features on a PC that is more powerful than any console is just insultingI played this game for free and I want a refundMadden 13 repackagedCtrl Cits weird this game reminds me of madden 21and madden 2and the one before that and before that and before thatIt is now a 17 game season but the announcers will still say The Jets have finished the season at an impressive 124  And that sums up all the effort that went into this game this year on every mode Ridiculousdont waste your money its last gen not current gen for pcThis game is just a copy paste of every other madden for the past few years with only a couple of new features Wait until it is on sale for 5 dollars because that is about all it is worth The fact that EA didnt make this PC version next gen is ridiculous and lazy It just shows that EA doesnt give a fuck about PC playersI cant lie this 5999 roster update is kinda trashI think the PC version is way more stable than the last 2other than that exact same game just with updated rosters Ill leave it up to you as to whether or not that is a plus or minusbut for me its a minus If EA is going to do thisthen madden should go free to playIm  a major football fanand a serious gamer at the same time In all honesty this game sucksEA takes it to an extreme on Madden One has to spend in the hundreds of dollars monthlyor put in roughly fifteen hours a week to create previously mentioned playable team Thats insaneif that was the only issueit could be overlooked FineI wont have an optimal teamyou might say Unfortunatelythis game has utterly failed to recreate NFL football in any way shape or form On defensethere is one of three plays that will allow you to cover receiversor get any pressure whatsoever on the QB Most games I play online devolve into my opponent running the exact same play repeatedly And since their no learning from my defensetheyll continue to pass for thirty or forty yards on attempt without repercussion This is frustrating at bestand controller breaking at worst Not saying Ive done that beforebut it happens to the best of usokthis isnt the worst part of this game Despite paying full price for an official Madden titleEA has made it abundantly clear that they have no real intention of supporting PC Madden play There are glitches in the game currently that have been there since day 1 And yetnot a finger has been lifted to fix them Im talking basic issuessuch as randomly blotted out score boardsor game crashes for no apparent reason Not only does EA not want to help with these issuewe arent even allowed to play the full game The NextGen edition has been locked behind the purchase of a new consolemeaning that even a top tier PC is unable to access it This edition of Madden is essentially everything new about this years Maddenincluding a constantly moving Momentum barand more realistic player movement EssentiallyMadden 22 is giving you practically nothing that prior Maddens did notyet still for the same 6 dollar price tagIm disappointed This franchise is one of the most profitable of all timeand has a sturdy player base to boot These issues that Ive mentioned are easy to fixyet boil down to simple laziness on the developers part AnywaysI hope youve gotten something of value out of this reviewand can now make an informed decision regarding the purchase of this comment I mention this as most reviews tend to sound like an eleven year old raging at a gameand fail to accurately summarize the problems this game has in a clear fashiongo buy madden 2  its betterDont buy this gameits the last gen version so even if your rocking a 3 like I amyour not gonna get high def textures or decreased loading times PersonallyI bought itI bought last yearsand ill buy next yearsbut im addicted to football EA preys on people like me to help pay their salary Its too late for mebut you can be betteryou are better than thisif its not obvious at this point I cannot help you
1,Its hard to overstate what a magnificent exploration and adventure game Subnautica isbut the accumulation of knowledge about the game worldits locationsand its inhabitants—is the most powerful weapon in a players arsenalfor example Theyre the first large predators a player will meetand initially theyre annoying and seem quite threatening An experienced player will ignore themthoughor at most circle and poke them with a knife to make them go awaywhile at the same time stealing all of their scrap It helps to have upgraded swim finsupgraded Oand other advantagesbut if you took upgraded fins and O tanks away from experienced playersthey still wouldnt have any issues with Stalkerssalvageand rare materials from wrecksgrottoesand strange installations will force you to leave your comfort zone time and again First youll crawl out of the Safe Shallowsthen youll creep further and deeperthen youll swim further still until one day youll be amazed at how far away from Lifepod  youve goneat the readout on your depth meterand youll wonder how you ever thought that the seaweed areas just outside of the Safe Shallows were in any way scaryand youll scramble to get enough food and waterbut later on they become a matter of management and planning ahead If youre going on a long expeditionyoull want enough supplies to last for the durationbut not so many that you cant haul a goodly amount of salvage back to baseyou can spend hours building and customizing your underwater habitatcustomize the look and module loadout of the various vehicles you can build once youve got the complete blueprints and necessary materialsand have a lot of fun with the wide array of gadgets and PortalHalfLifestyle technoguns the game has to offer Theres a lot of meat therebut the true meal lies in explorationthougharmed with all the technology youve spent hours pulling out of wrecks and scanning typically while watching your O meter like a hawk and listening nervously to that angry predator thrashing around outsideyoull never feel completely safe or at ease There are great dangers lying in waitand youd better hope you spot them on your sonar before their sonar catches wind of youI was sad when I finished this gamewilling you to go just a little deeper The crafting wasnt onerousthe story was compelling Wonder and terror at every turnI used to be a SCUBA diver  Cant do it anymore   There are days when I miss it all so bad it hurtshidden beneath the wavesit feeds the seahunger inside me somehow  Cant quite explain this sensation without having it sound corny and contrivedbut thats how it works for meas I recall  It was an Early Access releaseso I could expect all kinds of unforeseen digital weirdness happening inside the game itself  My PCs operating specs were a tad on the light side toobut it didnt matter  I wanted that game  Badlythe sights and sounds around you might seem strangely familiarin spite of the bizarre shapes Life has taken in this place  There is indescribable beauty to be found hereside by side with terrible dangers that are either innocently disguised or glaringly obvious  It takes a certain mindset to fully appreciate this worldas well as considerable restraint to avoid blindly lashing out at every shadow that flits past your facemaskSeriouslythis is one of the RARE early access games that has made good on its words Thank you on behalf of the gaming community on not taking the oppurtunity to rip us off like so many other developers did This game is well thought out and amazingly funlooks greatlots of hand crafted content and lovingly madeI just wish I could experience this game again for the first timeEveryone talks about how its early accessbugsblah blah blah If youre reading this reviewyou know about all that I recently realized I am a huge fan of survival sandbox gamesand I have played quite a few in the last months  Here is my personal impression of this onebut it needs repeating On the lowest settingsit still looks awesome Some clipping and suchbut it never really bothered me muchbut not enough to make it boringkeeping hydrated is the issue While this is rather ironic while being surrounded by waterit makes a lot more sense I get away with eating once every day or two depending on my activity Dehydration keeps me drinking dailybut not constantly Considering dehydration kills you faster than starvationI feel this is the most realistic representation I have seen in one of these games thus farit willits usually in a scary areaand once you dodo it very sparingly Discovery is an awesome feature to this game and the more you have to figure outthe more valuable this game will beTake it slowdo not rush Keep usage of guides to a minimum You will only play this for the first time onceAfter 41 hoursI feel like Im ready to say my piece about this game  Its important to specify that Im playing in survival mode where you have to constantly worry about food and water  The game will be very different depending on which mode you playbecause in the sandbox mode you can freely build and explore without ever having to stop what youre doing to gather nourishment  In hardcoreyou have to be extra carefulbecause once you die you have to start over  At this pointIm glad I did not pick hardcorebecause there are ways you can die that just arent forseeable  There also occasional bug in the game which results in your deathlike the all too common diving reel malfunctionsand issaid about many games  But there is nothing like Subnautica  I had been waiting for 19 yearsever since playing the crap out of the incredibly immersivefunbut ultimately flawed Sub Culture  Finallywe have a game that surpasses Sub Culture in every aspect except the storyline  With that saidSubnautica has flawsthere are a few nagssome of which make the game increasingly difficult as you get further into the game  FirstIm going to get it out of the way that there is a startup bug that made me almost request a refund even before getting into the game Subnautica doesnt always startbecause the game menu screen frequently refuses to fully load  This is probably some sort of GPU initialization issue that prevents the graphics from displaying properly  In any eventI have to exit out of the game and restart it in Window mode to get the game to finish loading at allThe learning curve is very steep  There are no instructions for anythingand the information given on any device in the crafting menus tell you nothing worthwhile about what stuff does  There are some basic descriptionsbut theyre very poor  For example the current generator says it generates current  When I started playing I had no idea what I would want to create a current for000 meters  Some have said 0000 meters  Others have said there is a secret world in the greatest depthswhich sounds pretty epic  In any event  The ocean goes deeper than I feel comfortable thinking about  The problem here lies in the fact that the vehicles seem to have a max depth of 00 meters  Ive since found the Cyclops can go to approximately 900 meters at the expense of power efficiency  I believe the Seamoth can also go to a comparable depththe hunger and thirst meters drop far too quickly  This seems nitpicky when you consider I did pick the survival modebut the problem with this system is that you have to spend hunger and thirst to find food that becomes increasily more difficult to find as the game goes on  As a resultyou might find yourself spending almost half your time gathering food and supplies to make water  Which leads me to the next problem in the gamescarcity of food and supplies for making water  At firsteverything is plentiful and readily available  Saltwhile a challenge to find when you dont know what youre looking forseems to respawn readily and limitlessly  Coralwhile seemingly limitless at firstbegins to disappear rapidly after many hours of gameplay  MoreoverI have seen no indication that it respawnswhich pretty much comes from the natural fish stockscan disappear amazingly fast from an area  After 41 hours of gamingI have effectively cleared all of the initial shallows of the oceanplus the surrounding depths of fish  Its amazing how fast they diminish  The only solution seems to be to put respawningor faster reproductionof the fish in the game  I have not seen any indication that the fish respawn at allwhich seems clear by some of the dead zones I have in my current save  There are some pretty heated debates about this in the discussion groups  Naysayers claim the supplies are unlimitedand all you have to do is look further  My answer to that is that you begin to spend a lot more thirst and food meterenergyand other resources to find foodbecause the reality is this  if people have no motivation to explore  If they just stick to the shallows and eat and drinkthey arent going to have the attention span to stick with the game for the long term anyway Apparentlya fix is being tested in the experimental modebut its coming all too slow to a stable buildand my final gripeand this is definitely as glaring as the fifthscarcity of resources  CopperQuartzAcid Mushrooms are plentiful at firstbut become ridiculously difficult to come by as the game goes on  Quartz is practically used in everythingbecause you need it for glass and rubberwhich you need for building and making Power Cells to power your vehicles  Each Power Cell takes a vast amount of resourceswhich would not be as much of a problem if they didnt deplete so rapidly  Even with the power efficiency mod only a small expedition can use 6 power cells and leave you scrambling for resources  Many users have defaulted to the same argument they have given to the food shortage problemthat theres plenty in the depths  The problem is that it takes more and more energyfoodand water to farm this stuff  You end up trapped in a cycle of more and more rapidly diminishing marginal utility on all of your resources  This really needs to be fixed or users will basically be driven out of their own game by scarcitywith the argument that resources are scarce in real life  I would like to point outhoweverthat one person alone in a wilderness does not leave vast expanses of land void of any life  Certainly these rich biomes should be able to support just one person  Alsoif the player were able to hunt for shellfish and crustaceans in the gamediversity of foods might help lower depletion rates  The player should be able to find oysters and dig for clamssome might get the idea that I dont like the game  That couldnt be more wrong  Subnautica ishands downsimply the best underwater game ever made  Theres no competition  The environment is richfull of wonderand among the most immersive games Ive ever played  The world is packed full of fascinating creaturesbeautiful vegetationand unparalleled undersea effects  The graphics are complimented by some of the most incredible sound you could possibly imagine  All of it adds up to a game that makes you feel like youre living rather than playingat least among those who have played it  In my opinionthe game hasnt gotten nearly the recognition it deserves  The amount of stuff you can do in this gameand the painstaking attention to detail are mindblowing  Those are things I hope never change with Subnautica  Many early access games are dumbed down in later iterations  Unknown Worlds Entertainment seems to have a good attitude about adding new features instead of taking them outlike some other developers of early access releases have done in the past  I just hope they maintain the trendworth its price about three times over  It comes with my highest recommendation In its current stateI would give Subnautica a 910DO NOTread any guides for this game Any hintno matter how minorwill ruin your enjoyment of this game You have been warned The world is not randomly generated like most survival games Keep exploringand you will succeed Wondering what is going on and what to do next is what this game is all aboutand has an astounding atmosphere Every new discovery gives you a sense of accomplishment that very few games deliveris that it ends Replay value will be low for most people It does have a hardcore modewhich may not be everyones cup of teaif you read this reviewrate Its not that I care about the ratingsI just want people to be aware of potentially ruining their experience by reading spoilersand Subnautica is simply one of the best games I ever played This is coming from a person that absolutely hates the water and can not swim in real lifeAs a man who is fast approaching 40 it is becoming increasingly more difficult for me to find video games that keep my attention  I am one of the earliest of the millennial generationborn in 81’and therefore I was privileged enough to grow up with the original gaming platforms and some of the greatest games ever made  But now that I’m getting older it is very rare that I actually enjoy a game at alllet alone play it through to the endit is one of the greatest games I’ve ever played in my life  I sincerely didn’t think I’d be saying that at my age  I wish I could go back and play it again for the first time  If you haven’t played it yetI envy youOpen world exploration by designpants soiling horror by incident Blends the concepts of innate human fear of deep water and unknown danger with constantall pervading curiosityGot this game in a last ditch effort to get my ten year old to spend time with his old mom He loves playing it on his xboxand constantly talks about it The other dayI sat with him and watched YouTube videos of Subnautica while he explained what the game was and about etc It dawned on me thenwe were spending time together It worked I bought Subnautica and we stayed up later than normal playing it together Of course it doesnt have multiplayerbut we both took turns gathering and making stuff We were each cheering as we found resourcesand we both were anxious to get away from the predators It was funand I am looking forward for this game to help us come together and spend time together like last nightand I am enjoying every minute of it When his dad is homehe gets so confused by what our son is sayingand I happily fill him in on the details In the gamewe have a base with a multipurpose roomthe submarine vehicleand were now getting the laser cutter He loves taking screen shots of our progress I cannot wait to see what more this game has to offerand Im sure we will both be enjoying it for a very long timeand with his cousinfor his birthday Sadly Im a college student with not that much moneyand gaming pcs are expensive I made a gofundme if anyone of you in the gaming community want to contribute I have the link to the gofundme in the comments to this review Thank you so much in advanceTo anyone reading this This game is best played COMPLETELY BLIND Dont watch Lets playsdont read the Subnautica wiki Just start the gamehands downthe best survival game Ive ever playedyou dont feel welcome Until you explore the areaovercome the obstacles  problems there You have to find out what wants to kill you From your comfort zone into the wild You make the unknown your new home You were afraid first Now you know what to dorepeatnot knowing what will happen Not knowing what to expectthe whole worldthe animals you meet Its a stunning worldand youre just a small part of itbuild vehicles Surviveadaptovercomethis game definitely should not be multiplayer I am glad it has only singleplayer You are alone You feel aloneI was kinda skeptical about buying this game at firstsince most games ive bought in early access kindddaaa sucked majorly Although I found a good deal on it and decided to try it outthey are so cuteevery time that little thought crosses your mind that your survival chance cant get any worseit can and it will Its almost like this game runs on your I hope this doesnt happen thoughtsits more focused on gameplay and mechanics at the moment I have to say thoughthe general background and lore of the game is very interesting and im excited to play through it when its finishedwhen you read all the reviews about the crashing and needing a beast computer to play isnt true at all I have never had a crashnone of my friends have ever crashedand if you really cant run this game at a playable FPS then you probably need to stop trying to use a baked potato for a graphics card This game is put together far better than most fully released games ive seen Yesmy framerate isnt pushing 8010fps BUT considering my laptop is about 3 years old and I still manage 300fps on a gorgeous game like this is amazingThere really arent any serious bugsthe most you really run into is like a light glitch or maybe a fish getting stuck in the groundnothing game breaking The mechanics and actual gameplay are FANTASTICI have to give the devs credits for a real original survival game since almost every one of them nowadays are about the same with either zombiescannibalsor just nature but underwater alien horror survival Thats newim sorry I suck at this Just buy the damn gameits worth every penny and youll enjoy the hell out of itIve never written a review for a game I have a decent collection and there are more than a few I recommend to friendsbut Ive never bothered to take the time to sit down and describe exactly why I love or hate a game I have very specific taste and telling people about all my little nitpicky problems always feels selfrighteous at best and masturbatory at worstwhen I tell you to drop whatever youre doingblock off a week from any and all social interactionbuy Subnautica and dive headfirst into itI want you to understand my full meaningand now that Im on my third playthrough I can actually articulate what exactly it does right And it does SO much right From minute oneevery action you take to further your survival gives you an actualorganic feeling of progression Every piece of equipment you fabricateevery square meter you exploreevery new thing you scan expands your capabilites and brings new opportunities and new challenges to light Want to build that heatresistant dive suit Youll need benezinefor which youll need to explorefor which youll need a submersiblefor which you need a power cellon and on Got the dive suit Greatnow you can build thermal plants to reliably charge your power cells Its magnificentthe more questions about the planet and its history arise I wont spoil anythingbut theres a number of truly great oh shit moments of the story that ask yet more questions and push you yet further and further into the deepthe look of the world is something like an underwater James Cameron wet dream pun intended and with each new biome you discover somewhere else to fall in love with The soundtrack mixes perfectly with the world to underscore and enhance the games wry humortouching tragedy and genuinepantsshitting terrorits scary too The stakes feel absolutely realand youd better be prepared if you want to reach the end Because there is an end iTheyi didnt reach itbut maybe you willrevel in itand when you get to the end look back on when all you had was a busted lifepod and remember what you needed most Youll know what I mean when you get there Good luckOne of those games I really wish I could forget and replayI pretty much agree with all the other positive commentshereand have nothing really new to addbut I still want to express my extreme satisfaction with the game by offering a few helpful tips for beginnersyou will need to think your way around hostile creatures  Surea knife can ward things off for a momentbut you need to have a back up plan such as fleeingor driving the creature away with subsequent attacks  Note that it is possible to kill stuffbut it isnt really necessary  I wouldnt be surpised if you can go the whole game without killing anythingreally even food  Asidelater on you can consider grappling on with your Prawnand using your mining arm attachment to drill a hostile creature  Underwater rodeobut you get thirsty pretty fast  Later onfarming Melons is a great way to manage hunger and thirst in one convenient food  You can even have a farm on the Cyclopsor you just like to explore at your own paceyou should consider creating your own navigational buoysbeacons  In addition to really important locationsI personally created three solely for triangulation  One near your life pod  One precisely 1000m to the north at the surface  And one precisely 1000m to the west  Thenswimming at the surface above every interesting landmarkresourcepoint of interestI would record the distance to each beacon with a pencilnotepad  Nowif you wanted to make your own mapyou would open up a graphic editor app such as SketchUpand draw your center beaconfollowed by your north and your west beacons  all 1000m apartremember  Now here is the magic part  Draw a circle from each corresponding buoy with a radius equal to the distance you wrote down  three circles one from each beacon radius  range in meters  See that intersection  Congratzyou just triangulated the position of that point of interestrelative to your navigation beaconsthenyou really do owe it to yourself to give this game a shot  Darting through coral reefslooking around cornerscatching a glimpse of creatures that could eat you in a single bite These are the experiences that literally take our breath away  You will not be disappointed  It should be noted that some may consider this a moderatetoextreme VR experience  If you need to blow the dust off your headset then you might want to work up your tolerance again about an hour or two per day for a week to get back in the saddle  Some dryeyetoo  Probably a VR comfort experience comparable to The Solus Project another game that I highly recommendreally  Just pick the place with the nicest view  I chose the Kelp forest because I could sit there and stare at my monitor for minutes at a time literallyyes I have no life ha watching the kelp wave in the currentwith the glitter of the surface waveaboveand little schools of fish playing amongst the various flora and crevices  PeacefulI also created two type of other bases  recon and outpost  Recon bases would be smallselfsustained two room setups in remote locations consisting of some foodwater supplies such as a melon farm as noted aboveand a sonar room  This would be used to filtersearch for specific resources such as copper and magnetite that would link with my HUD and add waypoints to help me find themthe outposts would be remote locations with rechargers for batteries and power cellsand farms  Some crafting station and storagetoo  Just a way of resupplying when away from homebut the game world is filled TO THE BRIM with more resources than any sane person should need  I even think somelike titaniumspawn ocassionally in the form of debris from the Aurora wreckage  You will not run out of anything  It might be a little burdensome to actually get out and explore to find more stuffbut you will find it  Just go with the flowand push those boundaries  The games beauty is worth pushing past your comfort zones  And dont worry so much about getting eaten alive  Save oftenand take risks  Thats part of the fun   The deepdarknoisy depths of this game arent nearly as terrifying as your mind will make it out to be  Sure there are some dangersbut you learn really quickly what you can get away withand when to keep looking over your shoulder blubablubablub  Hint The ocean is usually a noisy place its when it gets really quiet that you need to SWIM Dthe game is basically complete as far as Im concerned  I have completed the game 99or just short of spoiler the final step of leaving the planet spoiler with no showstopper technical issues  Basically bugfree with some minor glitches that can be avoided as long as you save often a sensible mantra for any gamer these days  I could be wrongor plans may changebut I believe they are planning 10 release in the first month or two of 018so at this pointas far as Im concernedthey focusing on optimization and polishand YESthey are still VERY active in the community  Im looking forward to supporting their next projectthere you have it  The game is worth the US that they are asking for it  The game is worth your timetoo  Having completed 99 of the game as noted aboveI feel like my sense of adventure has been satisfied for a great whileand I plan to come back for a speed run or two after official release  1 hoursso far  You cant get that kind of utility from going to the moviesor going to the bar  This game is WORTH it and moresomehow relaxing and stressful at the same timeOne of the best games I ever playedbeautiful and very realistic world Subnautica is mainly focused on exploration and it is extremely good In factI think that there are no enemies in this game at leastI could not perceive any creature as enemy They are not monsters but just local fauna that live their lifein fact they are not even aliensthey are at home and you were not invited There is only one alien on whole planet and this alien is you Once you learn behaviour of animals you will very rarely encounter any aggression If for some reason you want to fight wellyou may find a preybut bloodshed is absolutely senseless and unnecessarylack of oxygencramped caveslimited light deeper and deeper you wentmore and more awe you feel When your submarine hangs over the abyss and you can see nothing but endless cliff and depth it is scary wellI hardly can remember another game that gave me such intense emotionsfrom the very start you can travel welleverywhere Stillamount of accessable locations is cleverly limited by available technologies You can try to explore deep caves immediately after planetfall but without supply of oxygen you will just drown So game softly push player to explore safe shallows firstyet not intrusive in same time Bit by bit you will visit all locations and learn all mysteries Final scene gave me very complex and positive emotions  it is beautiful and full of hope with light sadness It was worth all long way downgather resources and craft equipment There is some grind but I can not say it is boring or tedious you just explore surroundings and study local lifegathering useful items by the way And second stage is travelling  when you gathered enough resources and crafted basic vehicle  Seamoth  you can explore almost everywhere There are only three vehicles in game  not too muchbut they are widely customisable You can install different modules  extra armortorpedo launchersdefensive electric field and so onalso it is available to change appearance of vehiclesuch as colour andfinallyyou can even give your vehicle a nameit is very easy to learn and comfortable to use There are lot of different modules you can combine and create your awesome station Even more importantlygame offers a lot of different furniture and decorations to customise your base and turn it to wellnot just a base but your home I really got attached to my tiny but comfortable underwater apartments and my tamed cuddlefish I really hope that my pets will survive without me waitit is just a game sighI must mention the stunning beauty of Subnautica Blazing sunsetsdense kelp forestsimpenetrable darkness with sparkles of luminescente flora and fauna almost every scene literally craves for screenshot As for sounds and music  they are excellentsuch quality is really impressive For exampleI humbly advise you to search for Tropical Eden melodyit creates amazing magical atmosphere I was truly enchanted withthere are some bugs Several times I seen fish swimming in my base Onceduring exploration of Aurora wreckI got stuck in textures and then suddenly fell out of the world Well all this tiny confusing troubles seems insignificant for mepleasure from discovering new things is worth the time If you love adventure games with main focus on exploration  Subnautica is a sure bet HonestlyI do not know any games that can compete with Subnautica in this nicheThis is one of those games where you look back and wish you could experience the game for the first time again Such a great experience and I couldnt recommend this game more

nowEVE reigns supreme Why Because it allows you to do whatever you want Do I want to mine I can just mine Do I want to go out and hunt miners Theres no need to change characterslevel an altor even abandon my career as an industrialistI can just fit a ship and go out and hunt You see Ive been playing for 1 hours thereand I havent been bored for long once If Im boredI do something else Theres always something elseand there are manymany good corporations and alliances If you are having trouble with the gameseek out a corporation I wont plug mine hereas I wholeheartedly believe that each player needs to find a place they belong in If you see that youve been playing for a few daysand you enjoy the gameget in a good corp It will make it ten times more funthey often ruin things players enjoy in their attempt to fix themand they often implement different things than what the community or logic dictates Dont get involved in the whole CCP sucks logicthoughnor allow bitter veterans bittervets of the game to lessen your enjoyment Its a companytheyre not godsnor are they demons In the endask yourself do you enjoy playing If soplay If notdont playunder the character name Quetzalcoatl III Im often mining3 hours into EVE and I have a namea great looking avatar and some photo ops for the ages  I know how to undock my ship and set a course NOTHING will hold me back now and I will rule this universe in no timetrying to figure out all the different angles to make money and do stuff in this damn game To fan the flames I have people wanting to do stuff with meand Im like I AM STILL DOING TUTORIAL MISSIONSLET ME LEARNbut I keep playinghere we godont push your excel sheet on me I respond immediately withFirst let me say I dont ever recommend you play it so fuck off cause you arent good enough for it First sign of addiction is getting defensivemost specifically with someone who has 3 accounts and can haul your ore back and reprocess it at 73I kind of want to keep playingswearing it is betterI Cant think of a single game I tried to like more than EVE Online I Tried soso hard and yetI cant I just cant I Even went as far as subscribing Omega for 1 monthon paper EVE is my perfect game It really isI unfortunately suffer from a sever lack of time to play video games due to several personal reasons that I believe are not relevant to this review And due to thisI considered my time invested into EVE preciousthere goes another couple of days for meof course of workI just like to play a bit more solo andlike I mentiona bit more casuallyI really didTo any one that never played do not skip the tutorialFly SafeI sold everything I had and joined a corp in nullsec within my first 3 daysbe careful they saidall I had to do was be carefulI told them that I am noob and I am requestion safe transit to my new corpsweating profuselyawaiting my imminent death at the hands of my pirate buddiesthey started to like meI felt like one of them and they wanted me to join them on their adventures through space and timeflying safely with my pirate friendswho batted off every attack we faced along the way with me hiding behind them like a kid behind a sofa to stay safemy new corpthe place where I would call home for the foreseeable future I was homeI thanked my pirate buddieswaiting for them to kill me at any moment for the lulz but they didnt they escorted me through the gate and on the other side something I will never forget happeneddestroying their ships and leaving them floating through space in nothing but their capsuleswe had come so far togetherwe had so much fun and they became my good friendsI am a pirate undercover in a nullsec corpI feed them intelligence about my every corps movements and siphen ISK to fund their piratingI can no longer in good faith recommend this game to anyone It boasts of being a sandbox with ‘playerdriven economy’ yet the devs keep putting their thumb on the scale with their artificial ‘resource shortages’ and contrived ‘loss mechanics’ I joined in 15 during Citadel They went from ‘we want you to own structures’ to ‘we want you to lose structures’ to ‘we want you to lose everything you own and be happy about it’played the tutorial missions andhaving done crafting for guildmates in previous mmosalmost immediately fell in love with industry I’d dabble in pvp and missions from time to time but mining and building gave me the greatest enjoyment I used to love building ships for friends I’d GIVE friends ships I started getting into reactions but stopped when every base I tried moving to kept getting blown uppeople I knew for years quit the game en masse There was an icemining multiboxer with 1 accounts that helped me get my start early on that dropped off the face of the planet A single parent with 5 miners ended up quitting to Fully 95 of people in EU I’d gotten to know since I started quit the game thanks to the devs’ abhorrent PLEX pricehiking moneygrabbing scheme An entire corp based in Germany quit Practically every single EU miner I’d cut my teeth with either unsubbed or quit outright I remember there used to be a guy from Finland who told me he once worked in Texas and it took him  years to rid himself of that Southern accent I remember there used to be a Scotsman with a voice that sounded like whiskey and marshmallows I miss those peopleand the devs drove them awayand this Triglavian Invasion bs they promoted with ‘changing the game forever’ just sliced and diced space and turned things into a nightmare for people like me that work long shifts and come home to unwind I had such high hopes when they teased new enemies in the previous yearbut I feel like they squandered what could’ve been good content If you fought for EDENCOM you basically got nothing for your efforts as they completely removed certain sites and nerfed others into obsolescenceI had to vigorously defend bases against poachers who would come in odd hours and abscond with as much rare ore as they could get their grubby mitts on We actually caught a streamer redhanded who bragged about how much rare ore he could find in our beltsand when the local German miners defended their baseshe said “wowX corp does NOT like us in this system” THAT was “playerbased” content There was no shortage of conflict even in highsec If it wasn’t poachers it was gankersgriefersextortionists you name itand every time its the same excuse ‘we have to discourage behaviors that lead to botting’ HOW ABOUT YOU BAN THE BOTS Oh no but they pay subs too apparently If the devs want the game to be nothing but whales they can have it I’m just done I canceled 4 of my accounts previously and they expire in May I will be canceling my ‘main’ account once I get back from fast I’m just done Stick a fork in me I’m done The devs have let the most repulsiveabhorrenttoxic people rule the roost Instead of addressing problems its all just nerfnerfnerfnerfnerfnerfnerf and Ive had itI’m just going to stop playing If devs feel like they don’t have to make a good game I feel like I want to spend time playingthen I don’t have to give them money I don’t exist for the sake of putting money in their pocket When I quit the first MMO I’d ever playeda dev there actually said something to the effect of ‘deal with it You don’t like itgo play Skyrim’ Well you know what Guess which game I’m still playing and which game I’m notthe stations were not fueledand as a result Ive lost everything within This included multiple mining barges and capitalsmillions of m3 in oreloot from various sitesevent itemseverything It doesnt matter to me if I have assets elsewherethis was stuff I personally worked hard to build and just like that its gone because CCP decreed that unless you shelled out bookoos of isk for their stupid quantum coreswhich I did a structure goes abandoned and everything is lost without going into safety Thank you CCP for cementing my decision They actually said something to the effect of once those who quit see what is coming with the update theyll come back Umnothey wont Because there are people whove played the game far longer than I have and have invested far more that quit much earlier than I did and never came back Congratulations CCP you lost a paying customer of over 6 years and youve actually stated you dont careI have been playing Eve Online for just over four years nowand hopefully this review can be of some help to those deciding if they really want to dive into the gamealthough the devs have been working hard to make it a little more newbro friendly The have added a lot of new fancy tutorials that did not exist when I started This is definitely a big plus if you are brand new Howeverdo not expect them to teach you everything This game is beyond expansiveand you will get lost in the complexity However the newbie channel chatsforumsand sometimes even local chat can be a big help Dont be afraid to ask questions Usually someone is more than willing to answeras many people as there are out there willing to help youthere are just as many willing to take advantage of you Whether that takes the form of stealing your stuffkilling youor picking on youit canand will happen Take every offer of help with a grain of saltor if it is a business dealbe especially careful This kind of behavior is completely legal in Eve because it is a sandbox The creators dont regulate anything that does not violate the EULA Its pretty much anything goes herebut its lame when you do it that way Eve was built to be a social game and a social experiment After you finish the tutorialsI highly suggest joining a player corporation As a new playerI highly suggest joining a newbro friendly corp like Eve UniversityPandemic Hordeor Red vs Blue Eve Uni will teach you anything you want to know about Eveand Horde and RvB are PvP oriented if you want to jump into that nicheit can take a really long time to train certain skills Playing for four yearsand I have only recently started getting into capital ships Do not expect to jump right in and be awesome at the game You will fight and struggle and diea lot HoweverEve is one of the most satisfying games ever if you stick with it You dont have to have all the skills to be goodand you dont have to train everything Just be patient with the progression and stick with it If you are looking for the instant gratification of a shooter or action gameyou best look elsewhere Eve is a game that lends itself to the longviewand definitely has a delayed gratification factorand finally Eve is awesome Whether or not you like it is usually dependent on your personalitybut regardlesss of whether or not you like itit is an impressive world that the devs have made Its a livingbreathing community that makes its own story Players decisions can affect thousands of other players The market is run by the playersand wars between massive player coalitions shake both individual playersand the player driven markets The PvP is the most exhilirating I have ever encounteredand I still get an adrenaline rush when taking ships into battle Im very much PvP centeredso I have done quite a bit Eve is unlike any MMO you have ever playedor ever will play It is singularand I think you should at least give it a shot If you dont like itthats okay Its not for everyone If you do thoughit can be a very rewarding experience and you will make some great friends Have fun and fly dangerousbut I am still very activeand I think it was the right move Now people can try it and see of they like it before making a monetary commitment Abyssal deadspace has been a big additionand the graphics are constantly being upgraded New player controlled structures are slowly replacing the old structure system and I think that is also a move in the right direction There has never been a better time to play Eveand a helpful friend when joining the game ie Me follow this linkDont do it The game is a masterpiece and truly unique in the world of gaming Its an MMO unlike any other MMO in existencein which case you will be nothing more than a minnow in a ocean full of sharks The game has been around for so long now that empire are set in stoneand a game that already had the learning curve of a vertical line is just a brutal experience for a new player Worse yetthe devs have kinda just given up the veil of pay to win and you can pay cash for skill points or in game currency While not true pay to winbecause player skill and allegiances count for a huge portion of successit just give you as a new player an avenue to waste real money while those with skill\friends can capitalize on it’s useyou will not be paying 115 per month to play this game If you get hooked expect hundreds to fall out of your walletI give it a recommended because it was one of the most unique gaming experiences I’ve had I still pop in now and thenbut I have to warn others do not enternot an exciting experiencebut rather getting tackled by a player likely an alt and obliterated by 3 others Suggest rather that they hook up with a roaming fleet to show them the ropes Howeversince everyone and their mother abuses Alpha accounts they will likely just think you are a spyNEW PLAYERS SHOULD READ THISand has amazing visuals Any SciFi fan will likely have a nerdgasm when they start playing There is a huge list of ships and attachmentswhich allow customization for any role you want to play Plenty of battlewhether it be PvP or PvE Huge player economy and many corporationswhich are the same as guilds or factionsbut you can purchase Omega timewhich unlocks all of the skillsand doubles your training speed Your skills have to be purchasedthen trained No way to grind skills fasterunless you spend money ISK as its referred to ingame on skill injectors There are also limited time events that give you small amounts of skill pointsbut other than thatskills take a set amount of time to train The time to train is listed by the skillbut most of the better ships can take months to learnand longer for the corresponding skills needed for their equipment There is no protection for new players You can get attacked in any systemunless you are docked in a station You could spend hours grinding money for a new shipand immediately get blown up when jumping to a new system  Rememberthe game has been going for more than a decadeso there are players and Corporations ingame that have amasses a staggering amount of top tier shipsequipmentand currency As a new playeryou will likely lose most ships that you buy from other players attacking you There is also a risk of getting attacked by NPCsand being a new player means you have no idea how to distinguish easy opponents from deadly ones There are a few players in game who devote a lot of time towards coaching and helping rookie players But ive found that there is also a large number of negative players Scamming players is allowedso the number of scams and scammers outweigh helpful players Voicing your frustrations will likely get you laughed ator talked down to So enter this game knowing that the odds are against you This game is incredibly funbut the community and learning curve are the only things stopping this game from being a world class game If you want help in the gamespeak to Mike Azariah or Corporal Phillip there are a few more helpful playersbut go in knowing that the worldor dare i say GALAXYare against youIt is easyYou have  choicesso I uninstalled  my child is happy nowYou have probably heard two kinds of information about EVE onlinetheres no directioneverything happens too slowly and everyone is a where everything is player driven Everyone is a  but it doesnt matter you can be one tooI forced myself to start learning the commerce and trade systembuy orders sell orders etc I started with hauling implants with my little ship and distributing them to more remote locations for profit There I slowly learned how the market works on a basic level and started to make bigger profits I had to compete against other players in my field of business PLUS while I was moving stuff around I got chased and destroyed numerous times by pirate playerssometimes losing valuable shipments and cursing out loud Sometimes I managed a very profitable cargo run and sold items for ridiculous profits Then after a few months of thisI was paying other players to haul my stuff across the systems and putting the transported wares on sale by my own corporation that had several characters I was paying the monthly subscription fee with ingame moneya feat I thought near impossible when I startedI used the money to buy small fightting vessels and went into small scale PvP combat Of course at first my a seemed more like a birthday breakfastwas handed to me on a tray more times than I can count But slowly I also learned this trade and moved into more serious PvP combatjoined the Faction Warfare circuit My biggest kill is worth over 3 billion ISK EVE currency unit and I have some sweet victories  though I never became a top tier fighter Maybe I was mid tier OKcrap tier but enthusiastic with a few good kills Lot of fun and some adrenaline toothat with luck you can find good people in New Eden and join or lead a worthwhile corporationdisappointments and failuresgriefers and scammers regularly and not get offendedeven adrenalinefueled moments and situations where you have a lot to lose or gainand then to actually winrobbedscammed or insulted pretty freely  giving a virtual sociopath a playground OR will you be the good guy and help out the newbie  who then maybe joins your corporation as a loyal foot soldier ready to work for the greater good Morals and the  freedom to apply them are one thing that make EVE so specialAs of right nowApril 16there is a big conflict in Null Security space Alliances on both sides of this conflict are currently recruiting a lot of new players into their ranksso if you ever wanted to try EVE Online out Now might be the best time to do sobut I would still suggest using a buddie invite link It will give you 5 skillpoints upon account creationwhich is a good few days worth of skill training and can be pretty useful for anyone who wants to get into the game depending on what you do with your time ingame It has been said many times before but still rings true The game is only as boring as you make it Its a sandbox game and therefore very openendedit doesnt hold your hand after youre done with the tutorialskillbooks and items to get you started It also provides you with a small taste of the things you can do ingame like MiningindustryMissions and explorationbut more likely to burn you out before you get into the gamejoining a corp that has a likeminded playstyle will increase your enjoyment and let you learn from more experienced players at the same timeanywhere Im not trying to scare you away from the gamechances are you wont be ganked until you are several months into the game I just want you to understand that you should NEVER fly anything you can not afford to lose It should be obviousbut some people still do and then complain about itdont be that guyyou lose your ship and everything on it once you get killed That includes cargo as wellso dont move anything extremely expensivehope to see you ingame o7Ive lost count of the times I thought about writing a review for EvEbut then put it off out of sheer exhaustionIm just going to dive headfirst into itchances are its out there waiting for youbecause I was under the assumption that soloplay was a virtual impossibility Thanks to the generous time limit of the EvE alpha account approaching eternityI was able to get my footing in the game and realize that you can in fact fly completely solo if you so desireand  like me  is deterred by a perceived requirement to engage with large player groups to get anything done just know thatwith enough determinationyou absolutely can forge your own path in this gameI feel its important to mention that a sizeable majority of players in EvE enjoy other pilots company in smallmedium and large groups Besides the obvious social aspectthere are a plethora of advantages to working together with other pilots in New Edenestablished groups  however big or small  can provide invaluable adviceguidance and resources that you will be hard pressed to acquire on your ownif you are not particularly opposed to joining a group of playersI would strongly suggest that you make it a priority as soon as you finish the ingame tutorialssince you have access to a free and endless trial account known as an Alpha accountdie oftenlearn lotschange it updont be afraid to change it up You never know when you stumble upon a new career path or task you really enjoybut it will eventually help steer you down a path youll enjoy in the gameso your reputation and actions in the world of New Eden carry real weight For better or for worse Alsoif you have a persistent negative interaction with another player in the gamejust simply block that person Youll never have to deal with that character againthrow some tips and isk their way Offering advicelinking a highsec exploration fit or giving them 5 million isk can make all the difference in the world for that person It happened to meand here I am todayI added a section mentioning this pointThat price tag is a lieits costs you your soulDO NOT BUY THROUGH STEAM  Go to EVEOnlinecom and get a free trial accountthen you qualify for discounts when you upgrade to a real account  You cannot link a Steam Account to an old account if you are coming backand they will not refundBoy oh boywhere can I start with this game Lemme give some newbies some tips hereI respect you but how the hell can you do it It is the least interactive experience in the whole game and the only true interaction you get with other players is when a ganker decides to destroy your little mining barge and feast on your newbie tearsjoin low sec pirates looking to prey on idiotsor join one of the big power blocs in nullsecFIND PEOPLE Eve is no fun solo You will burn out very quickly and hate the game as a resultI can almost certainly guarantee itthey will screw you This circles up to point but its still something that is very important to realize People want to screw you in various different wayswhether it is to take your hard earned isksteal loot off your dead ship or just the tears they get from you SO FIND SOME FRIENDSthose are the most important tips I think newbies need to here Nowwhat will you most likely not do in Eve Onlineunless you want another job Seriouslyits hardnot to mention actually getting players to follow you is like herding catstake literal years to train intoand are only called for the most important operations if you are a part of a nullsec alliance Just dontand people are getting better than ever at finding spiesif I cant do all thatwhat can I doEve Online needs new players Nullsec alliances in particular love newer players since they can build loyalty in a youngfresh recruit much better than in an old veteran who has hopped from alliance to alliance People will be willing to helpjust gotta ask aroundspecifically the people Ive met and what Ive done Whether it was being part of some multithousand man battleor just chilling in Teamspeak shooting the breeze with my CEOits been a blastthe best way to describe Eve is a game of experiences Is it the best MMO ever Probably not Is it the best SciFi game IMOnot even close Does any other game come even close to the experiences it can provide No ones in the same ballpark Soyes Play it for a while You might like it like I haveBased on feedback from my first reviewI felt compelled to update my original review  YesI have been playing this game since 1  In reality I was probably docked in station for the first five of those years and have a few alt charactersit is complicatedyou have to be patientthe game does not hand hold you throughout the game other than through the tutorials which I highly recommend completing or points you in a specific directionmany actions which other games are considered cheating are allowed by the Software Publisheryou may be ganked or lose that blinged out ship you just bought off of the market  But with every loss you should gain knowledge of what not to do again  Folks complain about constantly being podded or attacked while mining or whatever activitywhat those folks dont acknowledge is probably they werent paying attention afk mining or they were in the wrong Security space LOWNULLWorm Holeetcthere wasnt much information in game or out of the game  So what did the EVE Community do  They made their own tools and websitesEVE isnt for everyone and that is fine  But if you have patiencebe willing to make mistakes and learn from those mistakesyou can become whatever you want to be  Andif you dont like what you chose you can change and go down another pathyou could buy a blingy ship and outfit it with blingy weapons or buy skill points to gain a new skill  But if you do not know the mechanics of the game or have actual knowledge about the gameyou will lose your blingy ship or relieved of your assets very quicklyyou will lose your ships  Fact of life  Faster you accept loss the sooner you will enjoy gameI would encourage anyone to try EVE once  But realize its up to you to find your place in NEW EDEN  It may take time  You might make a few mistakes  You might lose your ship or even podded  But if you can find your way and maybe find a good corporation  The rewards are worth it  I am still trying to figure out what to do or flyIm more financially responsible in EVE Online than in real lifehelpranquility Ive always puzzled at the name of EVE Onlines single server Its an ironic moniker to lend to a world where hundreds of thousands of players jockey for resourcesschemespyand blow each other up On that one serverwars wage in perpetuity Scammers ply their trade outside crowded space stations Fortunes are made and lost amid the bustle of a fullfledged economy None of it feels particularly tranquilCarl Sagan once noted that from spaceEarthfor all its chaosis nothing but a pale blue dot So it goes with EVE step far enough back from CCPs scifi massively multiplayer online gameand a picture of tranquility begins to emerge Ten years of steady growth The recent release of a th free expansionRubicon Throughout allconsistency of visioncommitmentand support Its no small achievement in the winter of the massively multiplayer online roleplaying gamewhen young games are bornliveand dieall in World of Warcrafts shadow In the face of such competitionEVEs languid pace would seem a detrimentand yetlike the universeEVE is ever expanding outwardvectorsand inertiabecause it makes their mastery a matter of life and death The game supports a healthy variety of pursuitsincluding nonviolent options like buildingtradingor miningbut at some point almost all players must hazard a jaunt around EVEs tangled network of interconnected solar systems Each system is a room of sorts connected by stargates that act as metaphorical doorways Theyre spacious chambersbig enough to fit planetsasteroid beltsand space stations with a few trillion miles to sparebut danger always has a way of finding you in EVE If youre luckyitll only come in the form of pirates or warring fleets that open fire on sight If youre unluckyitll be a scammerspyor saboteur playing EVEs tacitly sanctioned metagame against youits easier to maintain a lively spaceship market if players are always blowing each other up But when things come to blowsits actually a tidy affair Ships can be piloted by clicking about in spacebut most actions in EVE hinge on more mechanical commands like maintain distance or warp to Its a mathoriented system that hinges on numbers like distanceradiiand acceleration Once the enemy has been targeted and the keys for weapons have been pressedbattles ebb and flow according to who can dictate range as their ships circle Largescale battles are as chaotic and complex as any scifi war sceneand skirmishes are thrillingly staccato Victory in either is less a product of reflex than of strategy The prelude to warproper equipmentcommunicationteammworkand patienceis usually the deciding factor As often as a good fight seems to find the unwilling in EVEit can prove elusive for those seeking it out For every minute of battle or plunderthere are hours spent as prey eludes captureas fleets circle and dance to the reports of their forward scoutsEVEs pace is glacial indeedright until it isnt A dominant alliance might hold a third of the world in an iron grip for agesuntil a spot of corporate espionage dispels it into the digital ether overnight An interstellar bank could compound every investment its entrusted with for yearsuntil it suddenly absconds with billions The universes first Titanclass ubership may be a worldbeateruntil its destroyed because the pilot chooses an inopportune moment to log off Theyre the kinds of stories that make headlines outside of gaming circlesthe kind that EVE is uniquely equipped to tell Whether youre speaking to the allure of exploring EVEs vast universethe machinations of its political sceneor even the prospects of the games next expansionthat capacity for upheaval is a draw unto itselftheir consciousness tied to clones that are awakened whenever they find themselves on the wrong end of the metaphorical photon torpedo Socalled pod pilots are the movers and shakers of the EVE universeand enjoy a privileged position as mercenary demigods consider for a moment the level of desperation that would drive a nonplayer character to enlist under a commander whoby definitionnever goes down with the shipand youll begin to grasp the morbidity of EVEs lore What gets moved or shaken is a matter of taste It might mean battleas a soldier or pirate It might mean cleaning up after said battlesand pawning the salvage Or it might mean moving goods from one place to anotherand shaking whenever outlaws start eyeing your loot Each endeavor can be pursued in the name of EVEs four hawkish NPC empiresa smattering of lesser powersor the great host of player corporationsbut in EVEthe decision can make or break the experience entirely Should you have no

pointillistic map But though the game now allows you to walk the interiors of these structurestheres little humanity to be found inside NPCs are still just portraits in the interface that proffer

1,Edit If youve stumbled upon this review somehowknow that most of these complaints have actually been fixed or otherwise addressed and this is not really accurate anymoretaking the spirit of the fighting genre and turning it into something new and exciting Its smoothintuitiveheartpounding action with the depth to keep you constantly learning and improving and getting better And when it all comes togetherit feels amazing Not to mention how astonishingly beautiful the animations are We as gamers tend to gloss over games having unrealistic animations so its truly mindblowing when you sit there and realize just how incredibly realistic your characters move around in For Honor no matter what theyre doingFor Honor has an ingame currency called Steel You get Steel by playing the campaignor doing daily ordersand you even get a little after every match And this would be all well and good if Steel was just for buying cosmetics It would be a nice progression system to keep you playing and drip feed you extras as a reward But nothats not where this story ends Because this game also has another very important progression system gearyoull be playing against other players playing the same exact hero you are but hitting twice as hardtaking half damageusing almost no staminagetting revenge four times as fastor many other numerous advantages depending on what stats they invested in You can win if youre the better playersurebut you have to be a MUCH better playermassive grind It took me roughly 7 hours of gameplay to finally fully outfit one single hero in 8 gear Does that sound bad Well thats still not itblueand purple So if you want to accelerate your gear grindyou might figure that youll just blow all your Steel on gear crates until you get a full purple setand then start upgrading Seems like a solid planright But whoopspurple gear cant drop until youre Reputation level 3 or higher with your heroand this information is NEVER PRESENTED IN GAME So in effecttrying to buy gear crates before youre Reputation 3 with a hero is a complete and utter waste of Steeland you have no way of knowing this unless you read guides or other community resourcesthis doesnt sound so badconsider your totally reasonable dreams crushedSteel can also be bought with real money Ahnow see with that in mindall this seemingly senseless game design suddenly starts making a very sinister kind of sense Why con people out of Steel by intentionally providing only vague descriptions of how loot works To get them to buy more Why have a matchmaker that regularly puts together extremely imbalancedonesided matches So that players get frustrated that they dont have good gear and potentially spend money on Steel to accelerate their gear grind Why lock purple gear behind Reputation levelsanyway To get people to spend money on Steel to spend on Champion Status so that they can grind Reputation levels fasterbut Ubisoft has mutilated and perverted it into the sick and twisted cash cow that now stands before you I am truly heartbroken at what could have beenand I can only hope that with enough critical feedbackeventually Ubisoft will give For Honor the respect it deserves as a video game and not as a psychologically manipulative microtransaction machineJoined last year on a sale week Started playing and immediately got hooked I was skeptical at first because folk were always on about OP this  OP that and This isnt balancedbut I can be a bit of a glutton for punishmentwas charmed by the games themeand wanted to see for myselfIm almost Rep 6 so Ive gotten my feet wet with this for sure In my time playingI havetheres always a window of opportunity to get out of it eg Cent Cutscene3 of my teammates dead and yelling at meand I won with barely any HP left as their yells then turn to praiseeven if you go into it with a cool headeven if you say you dont get upset by games something stupid will happen thats  out of your controland it will piss you off But thenyou have so much fun with the gameplaytheme itselfyou just keep coming back for morecome to your own judgmentbut Ill tell you right now dont give up if you get destroyed People think this game is easybut its not You cant win just by picking Oroachi and spamming Light attacks It might work for a bitbut you WILL find someone who knows how to deal with thatand you WILL be made helpless with your onetrick strategy Branch outand then learning how to deal with other characters as your character Attack speedsdelayspunishmentsmobilitycounters theres a lot that are factored inand the system is a lot more intricate than it seemsmatchmaking and server stability may be frustratingbut unless you have horrible luckits doesnt stay that way forever Sometimes stepping back from the game to breathe is a good ideasometimes going into VS AI for a bit or for some Orders will ease the stress But keep with it let loss be your fuelhave shortcomings enable your strive for greatnessjust because youre hit doesnt mean it was on purpose Just because theyre not near youdoesnt mean theyre not being helpful Look at yourself and see what YOU could have did better to stay by themor to better survive when solohave a good timeserver issues arent being ignored by Ubi which is why they do maintenanceas tough as it wasbecause weakness is only a perspective Now postrework I can be pretty scary with her Im not infallibleIm not the bestbut I hope you understand what Im getting aty my pp hardThe games like an abusive relationshipI bought the For Honor starter editionwhich many think is a poor decisionbut I disagree It took me 73 hours to fully unlock everything that is included in the full version of For Honor While that may seem like a lotevery single hour was packed full of medieval fun and with very little grinding boredom I also didnt spend a single dollar on the game other than buying the starter editionbut ever since they have had dedicated serversI have only experienced one disconnectwhich was when my power went outso it doesnt really countyou unlock those heroes in that faction to play so I would recommend researching which faction is right for youbut while this task may seem dauntingconsidering you only get about 25 steel a matchyou can complete orders and community events which can get you hundredsallowing you to accumulate steel much faster Keep in mindI never spent a single extra dollaryou can get everything that the full game has to offer with timebut much of that time can be spent on one herojust playing and mastering themso it doesnt become a grindy messthe servers are stablethe game is a ton of fun to play and buying the starter edition can save you moneyas long as you are willing to experience a slight grindthis game ruined my lifeMixed rating is very deserved It can be an extremely fun game but the lack of balance is frustrating The game doesnt know whether to balance around 4v4 or v causing unbalance in both modes Overall however I think its definitely more positive than negative If you take the time to learn all the complex mechanics in the gameI think you can have tons of funI hate this gameI Have Severe Mental Issues And I Want To Die Every Time I Play This GamePrinceKSA  Wowanxiety or high levels of stressMade me wanna kill myselfI hate the fact that I like this gameaffects my mental health in a negative wayFor HonorFor Honor is a solidfairly unique combat system with good variation and plenty of depth Theres a number of balancing issuesbut on the whole the core gameplay is robustchallengingand rewardingthe story is grand and cinematic and wellvoicedand the overall aesthetics are very pleasingP2P hostingand skipping any sort of balancing and connection stability tests In the rare event that a match is found without people leaving or being kickedthere is a strong likelihood that your opponents will have a subtle but unfair advantage in their loadoutregardless of whether they play honourably or notfor some reason the Ubiboys saw fit to incorporate a F2P unlock model within a fullpriced game You will be required to unlock items and heroes with ingame currency after paying full priceand you will be confronted with offers to speed up this process with additional purchases Absolutely disgustingbut in practice the effort in creating it has been extremely poorly distributedleaving the result a horrible glitchy disconnective yet graphically appealing mess Assuming you have the latest highend consumerslave hardware If your machine is average at bestthe game loses its only defence and becomes worthlessUbisofthTHIS GAME HAS CHANGED ENORMOUSLY SINCE ITS RELEASE IN FEBRUARY 27hand its P2P architecture creating numerous issuesand to top that off heroes were either completely overpowered or uselessmeaning that you only saw two or three heroes per match since those were basically easy wins And the cherry on top of all of this was poor communication from the developerscreating a feeling among players that this was just a money grab Ive been playing since Day and I can tell you that the game has made numerous changesand all are for the betterment of the gameAlso allows for team shuffling and increasing stabilityand done complete overhauls of 2 Done numerous adjustments to the entire castwhich leads to you staring at your opponent for long periods of time where they do

Mechanically this game is simply put fun 9 of the time The other  falls into the realm of inconsistency which has been a problem since day onelet me just say that the fashion is something worth grinding for You can suck at this game and still play for the fashion And it continues to get updatedthere is almost no reason to play ranked due to the rewards being very rare and its a duel gamemode Duels are extremely matchup dependent due to imbalance to characters in vadjust Trust me there is a way to beat just about everything Learn itKinda a lovehate relationshipif there was one statement to define this game it would probably be on the term of Abusive Relationship that you cant leave

1,Ive quit this game over  timesIm one of the sad adults still stuck in 7join meits lonelyFor claification sakeIve played this game since Beta and I love the overall animation and playstyle imaged as a D platformer I guess this really hit a nostalgia nerve for me and my yearning for the old Mario Brothers mechanics And while I hate to bash something I fell in love withthis is no longer the game that I use to knowyou had your 4 standard classes MageWarriorArcherThief Mage and Warrior had 3 subsets each Archer and Thief had  subsets Finding equipment and hanging out with friends was easy because there was just a few servers and not that many maps The level cap was set as a crazy but the mindless grinding wasnt so badcause you could easily be with your friends and if you found an equip you couldnt useone of them could and vice versayou would think this is a good thing more people  more friends  more equips Truebut Nexon saw this as an excellent opportunity to milk its players through microtransactionsNexon built more servers and mapscreating virtual spacial rifts between players It became more and more difficult to get to the same map as a friend without using a teleport rock a microtransaction item or wasting a bunch of time Nexon created petsvanity itemsworld transfersshops all for real money When that wasnt enoughthey created more character typesthose who couldnt share the cash shop items with the original charactersessentially urging players to rebuy cash items The new characters also lead to the nerfing of some of the original characters under the guise of improved for rebalancing issues Nexon raised the level cap to 5milking players for even longer They created a lottery system called gachapon for ingame items using real moneynot to mention special event lotteriesMost of us only come back for the nostalgiaEven logging in relies on RNGMapleStory was one of the first MMORPG titles Ive had the chance of playingbesides Runescape Classic which was a looong time agoas well as THOUSANDS of dollars spentI cannot say I am willing to recommend this gameMapleStory is one of the few D sidescrolling MMORPGs that try to mix cute and breathtaking togetherand at timesthey do it very well Some landscapes are hugethe original lore and locations were very well doneand one can be trapped in the games beauty for long periods of time Heckeven getting lost in that game was fun Howeverwith the changes as of the last two to three yearsa lot of the beauty has been lost In order to cater to the broader generation of players who demand instant gratificationthey have changed out most of the old expansive locations and replaced them with compacted versions  so that players can traverse the world much more quickly Howeverby doing sotheyve stuffed all the games content into the newer mapswhich makes most of the world appear small and claustrophobicor exploring the depths of Ludibriumthe background music really amplifies the mystery and beauty the game world is trying to becomeand each of them were uniquebut overall balanced Noweach large class update seems to focus on newer Hero charactersmost who severely outclass the older counterparts in terms of damage and flashiness In factthere are so many different Heroes nowadaysit saddens me to say that youll rarely run into the older classes anymoreexcept in the case of Legacy worldsthere are also items which give you in game currencysome which would offer you lowered failure chances when upgrading items The latter gives players who spend a huge lead over players who dontand this is made obvious by the overly high prices those items fetch on the marketplaceit also determines whether youll have to stay logged in to sell itemsplayers are only able to tradeso theyll have to solicit people in the market entrances and a bad support teamI truly cannot recommend this game to anyone MapleStorys golden days are long goneand whats left is a carcass of what was once a masterpieceA grindy gamelots of hackers and botters left in the game unbanned Got hit with a perm ban after 1k hours on steamand more on the nexon launcher Had a frenzy totemhigh rangeetc Not worth spending a decade of my life enjoyingThe game looks and sounds amazingbut I dont think theres anything positive I can say about the gameplayIve seen Nexon devolve into a sad Cookie Clicker design philosophy The game is now designed for you to sit in one placeon one mapholding the attack button for hours on end maybe with one or two other peoplethen change to a different map every couple levels and repeat the process Orheckjust pick one of the new characters with skills designed to kill everything on the screen indefinitely so you can literally AFKthen brag when you reach the max level with your Kanna by AFKing in a town and asking for Fame because theres nothing else to do in the game but grindwhich I dont begrudge them for tryingbut big dramatic story arcs werent what made this game popular New incomplete features are added before old ones they started years ago are finishedthe game has two bestiaries right nowboth of which are buggy and incomplete And thats not even to mention the broken questsredundant mapsand frequent crashesfrom a game design standpointthis is a mess Ill admit I keep coming back to the game because the nostalgia is strongbut as a critic delivering a critical analysisI cant recommend this gameIve played this game since I was 1 years old when it came out in americadeep hole out in the woodsyou panic and try to get out of the holeyou begin you like it in the holenicerand do more dpsloversand faggots inside of this holeit begins to feel like a communityand you will sell all your gear and quitand you become happy againthe hole has its ups and downsbut youyou were safe in the holeyou werehomeand thus begins the never ending downward spiral of your lifeDecent gameyou can sink a couple hours in itI remember waking up as a kidexcited and eager to start up my dads computerhopping into the world of Maplestoryready to take on whatever the game was going to throw at me that day Needless to sayI was hooked The cartoony yet oddly satisfying visualsthe huge world that was set before methe deceptively simple class systemall things that I adored about it For a whileI couldnt get enough of this game It was my first MMO everandto this dayprobably still my favorite Nothing comes close to the fun I had while killing mushrooms in the starting zoneslaying Balrogs on airshipsdestroying robots in Ludiand finallyconquering Zakum I made many friendsjoined a slew of guildsand mostlyjust had fun Thats what videogames were about back when I played Maplestoryand in a senseit seems like theyve kind of lost that recentlyalthough thats a different topic entirely Maplestory now seems to be much more oversaturated in terms of classes and things to doactually making it an overwhemingly experience rather than an extremely enjoyable oneone that I had when I played Needless to say howeverI still had a HUGE amount of fun with this gameand is handsdown one of the best experiencesif not THE bestIve had in gaming I cannot speak to the community nowbut when I was playingit was a bunch of generous and fun loving peopleones that were willing to help others when they needed it I miss Maplestoryspecifically old Maplestoryeven more specifically vwhen things were simpler and I had a bunch of NX to spend on a different hairstyleits been years but i still think about youI played Maple Story the very first day it was released to North America and since then the game has changed a tontook the world that everyone loved and threw it all over the place then they made these hero classes that made the orignal classes completely useless of which had the most insanely high damage youve ever seen Many of the cool dungeons in maple story became empty which is really sad because they was excellentI want my maple storyNexon is a greedy company but you wont really noticed how screwed up the game is unless you was there from the start You wont notice all the cool stuff taken out because theyll try to blind you with high numbers and stupid classes to ego stroke your dickI will never hate this game no matter how many times I quit it just to come back a year later to nolife for a few weeksThis game has the potential to be great The concept of a D MMORPG thats all animated is pretty cooland theres a lot of charm in this game I currently have a level 3 Kinesis in Reboot I use nexon launcher instead of steam and Ive somewhat enjoyed the grind up to that point The community at least in the server I play in is large and thriving Howeverthis game has major problems thats been in the game for as long as I can remembersome of the characters you can play can feel extremely fluidincludes buggy bossfightsbroken UIfrequent game crashespossible false banvery laggy servers in rebootidk how it is in other serversReboot servers overwhelmingly grindyas if they are purposely trying to slow down progression so as to increase the amount of money players have to put in this game They have no transparency whatsoever They often change the game without mentioning it in patch notes They have also done nothing to fix the known problems of the game that has been here for the longest timeif you want to play for nostalgias sake or just to try it out as a completely new playergo for it Its a nice experience to try this game if you get lucky and dont get bugged outand you can clearly see the charm this game has HoweverI would STRONGLY recommend NOT to play this game if you are looking for a game to spend a lot of time in Nexon has shown little to no interest in listening to the community and they probably never will You would be better off playing in a different game where the company actually cares about their community and things are hell of a lot more polished than this game isTheres a problem with my entire childhood being an online game because online games eventually dieI adored this game as a kid and nostalgia keeps me coming back but theres some glaring problems with itthe goodusing skills and running around the mob is exciting and satisfying The characters are super cutethe NPCs are designed well and every character has their own sort of story except the original explorers I actually really enjoyed going through every characters individual starting quests For a few brief momentsit did feel like a fun little RPG I also really enjoy the optional aesthetics they created in the cash shop I think the skins are really charmingthe pets are cute and the hair styles are funwhich is pretty much everything elselike an actual RPG Jane Doe needed help getting medicine and she gives you a cape as gratitude But nowthere are only about 35 quests until level 8 that you can do that are worth it Low level equipment is garbage because you get to level 1 so fast Everyone just does the theme dungeon because its the best way to get experienceso why do any other quests I consider bad game design when developers just write code over their old codeand dont maintain that old code If other quests arent worth itno one will do them and its just a waste of spaceand it makes other classes so unrewarding to playbecause if one class does so much betterwhy even play the old ones In other RPGsother status such as defense is worth looking into But due to the fact that you basically have to grind to lvl 1 to do anything funthe thing that matters is damage output Dont get me wrongother classes are viable not awfuljust not good its just that when a new class comes outit does so much more with such little resourcesit doesnt feel like you should ever revisit old charactersyou can simply increase your equipments stat through star enhancementso I can feel powerful without spending nx cash I appreciate this change but it made way for new problems I need A LOT of mesos to deck out everything and you can do that by doing certain boss fights but until level 1 you get the money by picking up mesos Thats so annoying to do without a petwhich requires moneywhich imo was fair You pay a little extra and you level up faster You can still level just fine on your ownthe x felt optional to me But they took that out now and you get the x coupons to give away if you spend enough NX Because of server abandonment issuescharacter world transfers are only available through a loot box mechanic systemwhich is a super scummy way of getting your players to spend more money To get the items you wantyou have to keep wasting more moneypurchase itand youre good to go Nowthere are only two hair coupons One is random royal hair coupon and the other one is a choice coupon Theres so many hair styles but they all go on rotationso the one you want might not be available until next month This means if you create a characterand want to change the hair style you HAVE TO choose and buy whatever is in stock at the moment This means if you dont like the hair your character hasyou have to change it to whats available then spend money to buy hair again when the one style you like comes outtheir text UI stays open when another text UI opens The search bar for their map stops working every once in a while If I cant find anythingthe world map crashes Upon even opening maplestoryit fails about 3 of the time and I have to relaunch it When I try to click on a spot in a mapa pop up says you dont have a teleport rock then navigation opens It feels like the developers were lazy and just didnt code that out Just write if rock not in inventory then dont show pop up But perhaps theres too much spaghetti code and they cant write over it It happens with projects that have too many developers or projects that are too oldtheres so much garbage stuffed in your face But this is a common flaw I see in a lot of MMOs The developers think players want every button for guildquestsminingetc available to themwithout considering how much it clutters a screen How are new players supposed to come to this game without being overwhelmed To get into ityou pretty much have to have a friend to guide you through itimowas completely nerf low level party quests They replaced everything with theme dungeonswhich give good exp but the reason why maple was so popular before was because of the social aspect I had to do ludi PQor kerning PQ and it was super fun I met people and made friendswhich made me want to continue to play PQs gave players reason to interact The social aspect of MMOs are what make MMOs enjoyable and nexon kind of just ruined thatbut thats it Dont spend money on this game Log in and have some funbut this game isnt worth giving to the company Some of the most disgusting tactics Ive seen with horrible customer service Events are buggynew players have a hard time progressingeverything is RNG Use it as an afk machine for when youre watching something or doing something on the sideMaplestory is like an abusive relationshipback in 7Ive been unable to stay awayand I have no clue why Surenostalgia is the main factorbut there are so many other games I played back then that dont keep me coming back as often No matter how many times I uninstall itit ends up on my computer again sometime between a few months and a year later Ive never even made it far most of the time I get a character to level 5 and see some other shiny class I want to try outand so I have quite a few 15th leveled characters that I can never seem to get past level 5 And yet I keep coming backAs someone who has played MS since the open beta ended way back when up til a few months agoand even played the KoreanJapanese and SEA servers at different points in timeI think I can give a prety good overviewwhich is absolutely absurd The grind to even play your character back then was absolutely ridiculous The only thing that preBig Bang Maplestory had that this version now doesnt is the sense of community and life that was everywhere People will say that there isnt a sense of community now and that people dont help each other which is untrue The community just isnt at the low levelslow levels meaning anything below  The players are still very friendly and helpfuland will go out of their way to party you if you have quests on the same mapand the ChuChu Island PQ at lvl 1 is a bunch of fun Except for birdsharks Fuck birdsharksso how many levels are there 5 There are 5 lvls in this game and at no time does the progression ever not give you rewards 114 give you skill points141 give you hyper skills1415 give you hyper ability pointsand every  levels after  gives you an extra node slot The first  lvls fly bythere are people that can do them in 8 hours and for some itll take a few weeks Most notably though is the insane Exp curve At lvl  the Exp required to level goes from about an hour or two to 4 hours or moreespecially if you play on Reboot and train in the Arcane maps before getting the 15x Arcane force multiplier from the daily quests And the grind only gets more and more difficult Previously I mentioned that at lvl 73 preBig Bang you could take 1 hours to level up Post Big Bang getting from 34 takes about as long without the Arcane force multiplier affecting your damage and letting you grind at better mobs Because as an unfunded character youre going to be grinding at either Scrapyard or the first area of Vanishing Journey for a good  or so weeks if you dont miss any Vanishing Journey daily quests Later on you can expect  exp per hourwhichconsidering the lvl requirements of later areas like Arcanais going to take you monthsjoining a goodactive guild is necessary If you dont join a goodactive guildon Reboot especiallyyour progression past  will be absolutely glacial You need a good guild to do end game bosses with and to get decent equipmentwhich is doubly true for Commerci PQ because most people arent going to risk having a random in their party looting a class specific weapon or mega rare item thats untradeable on Reboot and worth a bunch on regular servers So basicallyyou have to do your social networking and join a community of good playerswhich is really only a matter of timeyour progression is measured more in a few months at time than in days or weeks and there is something to do every single day you log in Most people who say that PreBig Bang was better doesnt remember how it used to be and they would quit it if they played it after they played the version that exists now In summationfuck PreBig Bangless so with the Japanese and even less with the SEA version So Ill start off with the easiestcompared to NAor Globalused to be different in that they would receive patches ahead of time of NA To my knowledge this is not true anymore The only real advantage SEA has is that it has a map called Parkin Lot which makes lvling to  even easier Beyond thatthe SEA economy is in absolute shambles and the Cash Shop aspect there is even worseit does not have Commerciit does not have ghost exorcist badgeand most importantly it does not have Kannas So why is this version the best Because it is the least PW The mileage system of KR Maple allows you to buy anything from the Cash Shopthe fact that you can get mileage from bossesfrom epic boss spawnsand from frequent events means that you can get pretty much anything you want You can also buy permanent Cash items either from the Cash Shop or from the fantastic economy The economy there is wonderful and not crazily inflated If I remember correctly 1bil mesos there is about  USDwhich is much much better than any other economy on any other version The events on this version are frequent and this version gets content the fastest and most frequently as well The last big difference is that this version has flames on equipmentwhich is another sort of equipment modifier I would still not recommend playing this version though unless you can understand Korean and are willing to practice how to type Korean characters There are a few reasons for thismainly the English community there is dying and there are only a handful of English speaking players leftyou need to know how to type Korean characters to even log into the game and you need them later on to answer antibotting captchas that randomly pop up Its fairly simple though to learnyou can learn with a few hours of practice and be fine The biggest reason I wouldnt recommend this version though is that you have to buy a premade account off of a shady Chinese website for 1mindless game If you can immerse yourself in the gameyoull have a great time As isbefore you even start the game you have to choose what youll invest Do you want to invest time or money into the game If timego to Rebootif not go to any regular server If you play Korean MSdont play Rebootif youre playing on notKMS Korean Maplestory make a Kannaespecially if youre on Rebootif youre on Reboot playing a Kanna and getting it to at least lvl 15 is mandatory so you can farm gold at a decent rateDamienLotusetc except for Bishops and Kannas because they DPS way too slowly and bring nothing to boss fights Ironically Bishops and Kannas are most valuable for grinding lvls and mesosso youve brought your main to lvl gotten your Kanna up to acceptable farming ratesand now youre looking for stuff to do inbetween Arcane River dailiesfarming for meso gear and bosses This is where you go make link and union muleswhich gives you a chance to play other classes without feeling like youre wasting time not playing on your main If you do get to the point where youre making mules for Union get your mules to 141 first for the most convenient Tier of Union and once you have all of them done go back around and get them to  for Grand Master Unionbut youll get there eventually any way Play it until you get boredquit for a while then come back and do it again for a bit You get to scratch your itch of playing a decentmindless MMO with others and your progression isnt invalidated by new stuff that comes out unless theres a complete overhaul again like Big Bang MAPLESTORY WAS BETTER
1,Ive already played this game for over 40 hours and Ive loved every minute of it except for the crashing early on Soheres my review for TABSthe good outweighs the bad massivelysome of the good things includemy favourite map so far is the Ancient Sandbox mapthe map is huge and every little thing is detailedfrom waterto windowsto ancient monuments Every map has a unique personality to it such as hiding little secrets looking at youtribal maps The maps in this game are far better than the maps showcased in earlier versionseach unit has a different weapon and costumethe amount of detail put into each unit is absurd The units in this game are far better than previous versions as they now have more than just a helmet and the sound of the units is amazingthe alpha versions had units just lunge at each other and friendly firenow units actually wind upfall overtry to miss hitting their teammates and work together The AI is a bit buggy at times but it is understandable for such a physics based gamegreat work to everyone working on them Im surprised how well the costumes stick to the unit and do not clip The uniforms are so detailedeven the weapons look great Some weapons have a few scratches that makes them look as if they have been used beforeI love these tiny detailsthey give the game and the units a lot more personality and help them fit in with the style of this gameUnit CreatorNew Factions bthe unit creator and new factions are absolutely amazingthe amount of detail put into each new unit is incredibleevery unit has its own quirks and its weapons and clothing can be found in the unit creator to be used on other units I love the new secret units as well as you have to go on a fun scavenger hunt around the map to find these new unitsbut the bugs in this game work perfectlythey fit in with the games wackiness and they are just plain amazingsometimes units freak out and die right before they attack another unitand sometimes units are stuck off the edges of cliffs and other units come and push them off The bugs in this game are absolutely hillairious and I wouldnt patch them even if I knew howthere isnt much to talk about in this categorythe only things that pop up are minor detailsso lets get into itthe game will lag if you decide to create a large scale battlethis is a very minor issue though and doesnt really interfere with gameplay as it only really affects sandbox modehits sometimes wont register properlyleaving enemy units aliveonce again its only a small issue and doesnt really affect gameplay unless you are in sandbox mode using slow motion to stop the lag from huge battles EDIT The hit detection has been fixed meaning that this is no longer a con of the gameTABS is my personal favourite game of all time and Im excited to see where it goes in the futurethere are a few bugs but most of them give the game personality and add to its wackinessI highly recommend this game to anyone looking for great games on steam If I had to rate it out of 0Id give ithope it helps youMy dad is an avid gamer with a huge steam library He gave me my first PC and my taste in games and he is what made me end up in a wellpaid IT job In my entire life have I not seen my dad laugh as hard he was in tearsalmost choking and redfaced as when we played this We have since beaten almost all the content in the game on his account together and we loved every minute of itJust letting you guys know there is a Mobile Game called Rise of Empire Ice and Fire using gameplay of this amazing games to advertise their game You might want to get rid of themgame is very goodbut we need chineseBring back Chicken Man ManI bought this game the day early access came out Ive been playing it for quite some timeso I should hopefully know what Im talking about in this review FirstlyTotally Accurate Battle SimulatorTABS as the name suggests is a battle simulator Its enjoyableand you can sink hours and hours into this gameat first Ill start with what I find great about this gameand honestlyi sunk at least 50 hours doing this aloneunitsand then share them with the communitythese are some of the best developers I have seen when it comes to how they interact with their fanbase Landfall is extremely friendlyand they listen to the community as wellbut the community is great Theyre welcomingand enjoy sharing their viewsit can be enjoyablewhile wonkyis still funI didnt mention multiplayer anywhere in this review since I havent tested it as of writingas well as if you enjoy the game or notyou may get somewhat bored after the 20 hour mark Of coursethis game isnt exactly meant to be played for 4 hours straightbut more of a Ill play for half an hour kind of gamebut units Since this game is heavy with physicsyou can expect performance to dropalthough this is partially my faultas I dont have that great of a computerId say for twenty dollarsthis game is worth it It depends on a few things you find interest inbut overallits a solid game Not only thisbut the game is still going to get some content postreleasesuch as the hero unitas well as possibly some more units I believe this is a good game that you might want to check outIt has been too longtime to review this masterpieceOnce the custom unit creation is finishedthis is undoubtedly the best battle simulator ever by a long shotand its hilariousthats it Thats all you need to knowWe need workshoppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppThe Campaign mode has a lot of interesting and difficult challenges All the units have different advantages and disadvantages to them and theres a lot of variety tooImagine if there was a multiplayer modeit was good back in alpha and its so much better now looks wonderfulsounds wonderfulplays wonderfullyMy grandfather loves itits easy enough to play but super funny We love to make new units and I would totally recommend this gameSOOOO heres my review for TABShowever when I went on YT yesterday and found Fully released TABS gameplay in my recommended I came directly here and bought it without skipping a heartbeat Nowfor the recordIm a little disappointedhowever Ill get to that later Lets start with the good partsand three different difficulties The game already had a campaignbut it was rather short and needed work This new campaign has exceeded expectations Well done LandFalland not just the same map reskinned For example the Ancient2 map which includes buildings This allows for new variations and strategies to be developedas well as exciting scenarios The maps also just look great in generaland it really adds another layer of realism to the game Desperately needed Overallthe outfits were done extremely welland I highly appreciate themsmooth interface for the new TABSyou may have noticed I havent covered the new units but I will get to that lateralthough this is to be expected for Early Access gamesthere is no help for controls Although basic controls are rather easy to get a hang ofmore advanced controls such as f for flyaround camera before match starts and slowmo controls leftclick and g are not pointed out to you Maybe a basic tutorial might help hereonly not laggy if you have it constantly on slowmotionbut it was kind of a disappointment when I first opened the game and realised they werent there Also other units showcased in videos upcoming to the full release werent released either Some of these I was also really looking forward to messing around withsuch as the Flamethrower and DaVinci Tankbuthowever there is many positive aspects as well I hope in the coming updates that these units will be added and the crash bug fixed My final rating is 70If I had this game when I was theres no way Id ever have left the computerprehistoric to wild westthe absolute greatest thing in the game imo is the unit creator when it first came outit was impossible to stop making unit after unitjust so many possibilities There are a lot of props for unadded factions in the UCso you can create those factions tooas some battles need a fluke or plain luck to win Also there is a range of bugsand the unit creator is unpolished though it could be getting updates laterWhen I was younger back in 20 I think I had seen videos of people playing the original TABS and I instantly loved it I had always wanted to get the game but I had never known how Sowhen this new version of TABS came out early alphaI was old enough to figure out how to finally get the game I remember that I had gone to Target and bought a Steam gift card it was the only way I knew how to buy the game at the time and downloaded Steam for the single purpose of getting TABS Nowover a year and four months laterI have gotten some other games on Steam but TABS has always been my absolute favorite and is the single most played game which I ownwith that time being over 300 hours What can I say I just really like the game To anyone who reads this and doesnt own the gameI recommend that you at least watch some youtubers play TABS first and see whether or not the game is your cup of tea If it isthen I sincerely hope you enjoy the game as much as I doand have funthis is a awesome twist to the old

0,In 2009during my last semester of high schoolI created the original Legion TD map on Warcraft 3 I made it just for funto play with friends from schoolFootiesWintermauland every other TD out therenothing ever felt like the game for me I wanted gameplay that wasso I could queue with my brossince Im a tryhardwithout all the microsince I have terrible aim26 lines of code laterbut proud of the game Legion TD 2 has become Chilllike a TDyet deeply strategic After thousands of hourstheres more to discoverI still like to relax and unwind by playingLegion TD 2Getting to enjoy Legion TD without touching a blizzard game WinwinGreat gamebut I miss to have the option myself to play either v or 2v2 The developer Just removed vbecause of the queue time I say its up to us to decide Please bring it backLegion TD2 is a great remake of the WCSC mod Give it a shot if you enjoyed those games Nothing in this game is P2W the store only sells skinsif u from wc3 u will love itGood old legion tdif you played it back in the day  you already bought this gameCurrently close to 1200 hours inIm one of the top players of this gameso my review would be completely biased since Im obviously addicted to the game because Ive dedicated so much time to itbut Ill do my best to be as objective as possible from a new players PoVeven though it currently has some balance issuesso if you are a competitive playerthis is the game for you Sadlythe competitiveness comes at the sake of sacrificing some of the funotherwise youll find the game stale after a few matchesyet a legion which has a total of 6 units is released like once every 78 months due to development downtime and other issuesa change which arguably made the game less fun for many players This game is fun with friendsless friendsless fun for most people The game is also pretty much dead during NA dayEU nightas there are only around 150 players online So if you wanna playId suggest you play during EU peak timeDotACSGO and othersit can be worth 20but for 97 of the playersit isntit can be worth 10 during the occasional salesbut even like thatprobably around 50 of the players will stop playing after a few hours of gameplayso keep that in mind when deciding to purchase ityou are better off waiting for WC3 Reforgedgetting your Legion TD fix from wc3sc2 custom maps ignore DotA 2 LTD versionthat thing is trashunless the price tag on LTD2 goes down by a lotor unless the development of this game speeds up by A LOTbut since I got a notification because this review got a developer responseI just have to point this out 5778 hrs on record 11970 hrs at review timesince the devs do have a history of being quite salty and responding negatively to critics about their changes After a quick check of SteamDBit seems that not much has changed in terms of this games popularitywhich is sadwith better managementthis could have been a really successful titleI dont normally write reviews but I want this game to grow because it deserve all the praise it getsif you looking for chill games then you can find it here Alsoif you are looking for competitive environment then you are at the right spot because in ranked mode games it actually require some thinking and focus to be able to win which is fun aswell FUN GAME and easily can spend 100hrs in itThis game is the standalone sequel to the map Legion TD on Warcraft 3 It is being made by the same people as the wc3 map and they are doing a fantastic jobeveryone has their own playstyle and it is super rare to see the same builds choosing the same towers on multiple players in the same gameWorse than original wc3 mapbut i had some enjoyable hourshoping the game got betterbut its notbasicallyyou play the game  times Then play until you win 1 time and There is no more fun Does it cost 20 Nopethey just make it better and more fun Butthe custom map and the game has a lot of differencestowers become units and fight with enemies If all your units diesenemy units go to the king and attack him If the king dies  the game is over Seems simpleLegion TD has only  buildersthen original map had more than 10 builders tt20 enemy waveselfsdemons and etc There is a bee with boxing gloves stand with Makaka tree Its not funnybecause someone lost connectionI recommend you to play this map one more time in Warcraft III for freebecause the game is current state is not goodADD PAUSE FUNCTION VERSUS BOTSNeeds a pause button especially for the pve missionsThe TD That Wishes It Was a MOBAId walk away from battlenet and go play other thingsbut then Id get a craving for custom games and go back Ive seen many many iterations of Legion through the yearsweve got a clean uinicer graphicsand no need to deal with the different bot hosts and all the garbage that comes along with bots and their specific rules Theres an official forumthree game modes four if you count practice against botsintegrated player profilesand a few other bells and whistles that none of us had in the original versionand am one of the highest leveled people in the game at the moment Unfortunatelytheres some other issues going on with this standalone version Ill leave it to you to review and decide what kind of tower defense gamer you areyoull be required to play against bots for a bitand the mastermind well get to that later mode will be locked to you Sadlyyou do not get a primer on why armor and attack types are important There is documentation on the forum about all the units and their attack and armor typesbut you need to find it You need to have a basic understanding of the old system Blah blah blah Theyve implemented a spell system that grants you one major bonus after level ten There isnt much documentation on thatand youll have to visit the forums for what little is thereand theyre just going to keep parroting As it is a team gameyour rating will suffer from many matchups with someone just parroting what they saw someone else dothis is the preferred builder by the elite The developers have taken note that the elite prefer this builder and have been tailoring all of their tweaks to units based on numbers theyre crunching from mastermind games Surprise This has made the other three regular builders virtually unplayable In factthe game gives you bonuses for choosing the mastermind builderbut nothing for choosing a regular builder So if you do have a soft spot for say elemental expect future tweaks to your units to be a reflection of what mastermind players have been doing to one or two of your units See where this is going Good Lets move onand eventually master after education I covered that already and experience UnfortunatelyIm regularly reduced to a raging crazylady cussing out kids beforeduringand after games Heres whyunitsetc It shows in the community It shows in members of the community making smurfs Yes Smurfs For a TD Let that sink in It shows in the rampant racismsexismand general bad mouthing in chat It shows when theres so many streamers for a TD Most of them appear to be Alex P Keaton cosplays with a German accent I can go on and onabout the MOBA mentality herebut you should get the idea by nowIts a good gameno doubt But my wish to the developersbut let us decide if we want to wait 10 min for a gameI think you reduced it to 20 waves because of game lengthbut I still prefer the old WC3 mod because of it With longer games and more allies to catch your leaksyou allow for more dynamic games were you can fall behind and catch up etcI enjoy playing it  But still not as good as the original oneIMOI just read a couple of reviews of the game which made me write this onewhich turns the game into a RNG party That is just false In ranked 2v2 it is true you no longer can pick a legionbut is it unbalanced No The very active devs have made the game balanced by having every damage and defense type present in your roll They even added some AI roll helper to help new players select a good roll 1 for thatit is true there no longer is competetive vbut I see that as a positive thingas your decision has greater impact on the game in 2v2 If you truly love v you can still play it casually though  If youre a new player which you still areeven though you played the WC3 mod i recommend you play v and learn the basics How to effectively push workersgood unit positioningsendsdmgdefense types etcit is a project I have loved to follow over the months I have been playing Look forward to many more months I currently put 56 hours into the gamea lot of afkbut still quite a few games p 752 games to be exact Awesome multiplayer autobattlerwith a thrivinggenerally nice communityand ongoing developmentand with that gold you can buy new fighters in between the waves The game gives a recommended value of your fighters for each wave consisting of the total possible value that comes spawning Depending on the type of units you have put on your lane with all their synergies and positioningthis value can be either too high or too low For instancea collection of only tanks units that soak damage wellbut dont deal much themselves will probably not clear a waveand your opposing team also gets a cutas seen on the ingame diagramand these values arent linear A magic damage dealer will struggle against arcane armourbut will melt through nature armourcalled mythium Mythium is used to hire mercenaries that will join the next wave of the opponent Hiring mercenaries raises your income that you receive after a wave is finished The mercenaries are dependant on the amount of mythium you spend how powerful they are You can also choose more powerful units at a reduced income And in this part is where most battles are fought In recognising your opponents build to choose a wave to enhance And of course synchronising your sends with teammatehowever his opponent might be strong on that waveso that may not be the best tactic Another tactic is just to go for the best possible incomeand deal with any opposition by shear valueand ahead with your workers Purposely leaking one or two units gives you more juicy mythiumand if you are ahead on worker countyou will gain an advantageDivineElementForsakenGrove MechNoomad and Shrineeach with six tiers of fighters Originally in the predecessors of this game you chose one Legion and battled with those But this got a bit boringso now you play with selected group of fighters from a random selection of all Legions This makes for much more variety in the gamesand less repetitionand it was significantly differentwith more Squadrons and at some point a leaderboard Very fond memories thereand I wish that maplayout gets implemented in this gamebecause I loved the shared buildingzonesuch as the fully random hybrid Can be queued up to eight peoplesuch as high incomeyou can browse top games of the best playersand can test builds in a sandboxI immediately bought itwhich is rare for me I have such good memories of STDplaying so many games without even a ladder But nowadays Im not really looking for an endless gameand not just ladder for ladders sake So the game shifted to my backlog Now that the game is fully released since two monthsIve got a clear goal in getting all achievements The biggest part is getting 100 wins in one season in both ranked and classic Im practically done with the ranked oneand felt it was time to review thisso I got to bronze ELO below 1200 Now I got to around 16001700maybe I will try for Diamond 1800 For a physically handicapped player Im satisfiedbecause some waves I dont have enough time to do the things Id like to dohehebut in that case its untrue Yes you can also grind like 00 games to create onemy point is that a social feature doesnt belong behind any wall whatsoevergames that are easy to control for handicapped gamers itdAfter playing 500 hours of this game during the AlphaI can honestly say that i had a lot of funLegion TD 2 gives you that great feeling of when you survive with 1 HP and you know that everything you do can and will have a big impact on the outcome of the gameyou also have a huge range of things that you can do every roundand thats what makes every game you play different from one anotherdont be shy and try it outthe community is great and everyone is welcomingincluding the devsh1The legions return straight from 2009h1coming from a Warcraft 3 mod called Legion TD that was made in 2009 Unlike many tower defense gamesyou wont be recruiting turrets around a specific path that the enemies will follow Insteadyoull be recruiting fighters in your lane that will charge the enemy to protect your king Ohand you can also recruit mercenaries to attack the opponents lanes And have I mentioned the fact that doing that also makes you earn more gold Legion TD 2 is a pretty complex gameso lets unveil it in this reviewconsidering the amount of stuff it has to explainis not the easiest of feats This is a title with an extremely simple conceptthat is instead very complex under the hoodthanks to its many different mechanics The grand goal of a Legion TD 2 match is easy protect your king and kill the enemies one In order to do thisyou have to hire fighters to protect your lane against increasingly harder hordes of enemies In order to recruit themyou will use gold that is earned by killing the attacking enemies and by completing waves Pretty easy right This is where things get messyyou can also attack your opponents This is done by hiring mercenaries using mythiumanother resource thatunlike goldis earned in time by training miners Mercenaries will attack one specific opponent decided at the start of the game andonce trainedwill boost the gold you earn by completing waves for the rest of the game This opens up a myriad of possibilitiessince the game offers a lot of different mercenaries that can be used in very different scenarios the snail is the very first mercenary youll hire in every gameoffering basically no power but boosting your initial earnings There are tank mercenariesand some that give you reduced income but that are more powerful in terms of attackhp pool or even special abilities Basicallyevery match follows a loop spend gold to train fighterswhich defeat enemies and earn gold Plusspend gold to train minerswhich earn mythiumwhich you can use to hire mercenaries that attack your opponent AND give you a permanent gold boost on each wavewhen waves get tougheryou can start saving it to send multiple stronger mercenaries in the same wave as bosses or particularly strong enemies This also creates a very interesting carrysupport strategysince training miners costs goldone player can focus more on attackingwhile the ally can spend more gold on fighters and protect the kingso much so that a slightly underperforming ally can doom your game this is particularly true in the mastermind mode the 2v2 ranked playlistwhich at times can be very frustrating Thusbefore buying Legion TD 2I would really think about convincing a friend to get it too But lets get back to leaking we say that a lane leaks when the invaders destroy all defending forces Your lane could leakor your friends or your enemies The important aspect of leaking is thatif properly managedits not a tragedy the different lanes do in fact converge into a single one before getting to your teams king Hereall the fighters that cleared their lanes are gatheredso that they can make one last defense against the leaked waves This opens up the strategy that I was talking about in the last chapter one player can focus on attacking the opponent and making him leak While he does thishe focuses less on defenses because the other teammate can catch leaks for himwhile the mercenaries roster stays the same every gamethe roster of defending creatures will change every gamedepending on the selected game mode in v you get to decide which roster to pick out of 8 different legionseach one having a specific and balanced set of fighters that follow the legions theme In MastermindLegions ranked modeyou will instead play 2v2 and get a randomized set of fighterswith the possibility of control that randomization at the start of the game Againthe game opens up to very different strategiesallowing you to pick the path you think will be the best you can either go for a full random approach and get more gold right from the startor you could try to control the randomness and lock in a fighter and gets unit rerolls This title offers a truly incredible amount of optionswhich is also why I liked it so muchmaking it a title with very simple graphics Fighters models follow the same rule and have very few polygonsbut most of the time you will be watching them from far awayso you wont notice it so muchwellimplemented and the game hardly gets boring even after hours of gameplaydue to its very competitive nature and the different lineups at the start of each match Just be sure to buy it with a friend every game is funnier with a friendbut this title really shines when building strategies togetherposted dailyquoteSome people might think this review might be biased because of my large amount of hours playing this game or by the fact that I am very invested in the evolution of the game and the growth of it I promise however to be as objective as possible in this reviewthere are flawsbut so much fun can be had while playing and most of the community and developers are always willing to help any players with their problems For that I recommend it for youbut I cannot decide for you Create your own opinionthis game is made by a very devoted team of  developers The result is not perfectthere are some few bugs here and therebut they are very open to those bugs and encourage any report of them to try and correct them in the following patch This shows the willingness of the team to make the game better and attracting to all new playersthe honest truth is that the game seems pretty basic place towers and hold incoming waves of enemies while trying to disrupt the hold of your opponentbut the skill ceiling is incredibly high and hard to reach You need a lot of time investment to try and reach the top of the leaderboard and understand the different aspect of the game if you so wish to compete at the top There are also some tournaments for those top players if they so wish to test themselves amongst the best Howeverthere are many different things a new player can do to try and improve or just play for funlike playing the campaignsplaying against the AItrying to beat the weekly challenge or even play a casual match of vthere is sadly not a lot of guides to go to and for thatthere is two main reasons  the game is constantly evolving and the shear amount of possible combination and situations make it too large of a time commitment for non fulltime content creators Alasdo not fearthe top players of this game are often willing to answer any questions on the discord or on their streams and even analyse your previous game to tell you what you could have done or improved This case by case approach is not ideal of coursebut seems to be working well for the moment The community will need to adapt to a larger number of players but there is already a large effort by the community including myself to include content on youtube to help players see the game the way top players sees itthe rate of content release is expected to be very slow due to the small team that is working on this game Howeverevery updates are treated with special careoften asking the opinion of the community to see if the update makes sense in term of power levelsplayability and feeling The base buffs and nerfs are however carefully treated thanks to a large amount of data including winrate and playrate These numbers do not always tell the full story and that is why the top players often gives their thoughts on the current game state and unit state through some tier lists This further helps the balancing of the gamewe need to address the elephant in the roomit is a competitive game and thus is not protected from the judgement of the skills of others and sometime can lead to toxicity There is a ban system and chat restriction implemented in the game and is reliant on the individual reports of the players Since the community is small at the momentthe toxic behaviours are mostly suppressed at least in the range of players I encounter which I admit is a small fraction Online competitive games will never be fully protected from that because humans are humans and they are as they arebut the system to deal with it is implemented and well functional I do however believe that the willingness of top players and the developers to help the community is a proof that the game wants to minimise the toxicity and do not promote itI do hope it was helpful to give you an overview of what the game wants to aim to be and how the community and developers are committed to keeping this game in constant evolution by doing updatespromoting tournaments and leagues as well as creating content on different platforms to help the playerbase improve and growbut I do recommend it even just as a casual game to play with your friendstrying combosplaying against yourselvestest your skills on the ladder or goof around in casual play while testing different units and synergiesthus creating a possible strategy or build to emerge at anytime if only one player decides to go further than the othersGive this game a chancethe developers are always working in the gameyou can check the recent updates to see the amount of effort they are putting in the game
1,bNote This review wont be about the game or the story itself really its the same trilogy we fell in love with Ratherthis review is to primarily focus on the changes between the original games and the Legendary Editionband wow does it stand out In all three gamesespecially in Mass Effect 3 did it look very polisheddetailedand rendered beautifully The lighting as well as the scenery stood outmore visually than before and the special effects as well as the atmosphere  all in k Characters also look polished and not as ugly anymorethough the models in Mass Effect 1 definitely arent going to look as good as those in ME 2  3but was much needed Now its very easy to pause the game whenever even during combat and just zoom inrotate the camerachange filtersadjust the brightness or blur out the background to make the characters focusedect The amount of screenshots and pictures I took is insaneand a very welcome edition to this game Trust mego to Discord or Reddit devoted to Mass Effectand the amount of pictures is staggeringthey did not come with Controller Support You would of had to install a program online or do specific steps in getting it to work with your controllerand even then it was a pain Now you can just use an Xbox One controller or a PC controller without issue As someone who grew up playing on consolethis was a must have for me to enjoy the game morea number of things appearancesdesigneventsect have been changed I came across a few things they changed for the betterand one in particular is a spoiler in ME 3but it was so good to see them change involves Tali The biggest changes are likely in ME 1with environment changes and how the layout looksalong with the fact combat is more smooth and balanced in ME 1 now In ME 2  3its unchanged for the most partbut the interface as well as quality of life improvements are theredespite I loved playing Legendary Editionthere was numerous problems I came across One major issue stemmed from collision In ME 12and 3sometimes Shepard will find himself going over terrain or passing over into a wallonly to get stuck and nothing will fix that unless you restart a save or the mission itself Another issue is the flare being incredibly bright at timeseven toning it down to its lowestthe flare and shine of things can be blinding Sometimes lip syncing is a bit off ME 1 and ME 3 had a few instances of this and followers not popping in at times There is also no multiplayer which was a massive let down I loved the multiplayer in ME 3being able to play any race was so incredible and the wave of enemies per round was exciting to survive in with my friends I wish they included itthe enemy AI can be dumb to auto bot levels depending on the circumstances I played on Insanity and ME 2 had every enemy become an auto botalways aiming for me in a split second with 100 perfect accuracy and never aiming for anyone elseeven walking PAST my allies to shoot me Then you have my AI squadmates being very broken or dumbdepending on againthe circumstances In ME 1they were so useless it was painful In ME 2they were alright but had some dumb moments In ME 3they could carry me and I would look at my phone as they did all the work if you build them right Balance and AI are a big problem in Legendaryand I hope they improve AI for everyones sanityif you want to relive the trilogy and have an excuseI say go for it The price is reasonable despite a lot of people want the game cheaper or free if they own the original games already But if you think about itall 3 games 20 each plus every DLC released are free in Legendary Edition But apart from thatdespite I did very much enjoy playing this trilogy all over againthe changes arent that big in scope Mostly just better graphicsbetter framerateadjustments in combat and adding a few changes to scenes  design of things If youre a huge fan like me and dont mindthen yea it is worth But if you arent that impressed with the perks of Legendary Editionyou arent missing out on too much Legendary Edition is like the old trilogy but in nicer paintpolishedand got some upgrades But even with that saidthis was such a treat and I enjoyed every momenteven with the stacked cons Amazing series overalla must have whether its the older games or Legendary Editionh3First things firsth3this version isnt super easy to recommend unless youre just a hyperfansuch as myself Howeverif youre a person that does unotu possess all three games and their DLC in one placeI can highly recommend this versiontruth be told Especially for ME1 where it originally never told you that you can drag and drop abilities into the hotbar These games were designed for consoles first The original release dates span from 20072012 Designing games for console first wasis just how the Triple A industry functionedespecially at the time Were seeing a slight shift away from that now and I suppose you could argue they should have changed how the game functions in this remasterbut I would contend that uthis version is essentially a collection with improved visuals more than anything else Its simply not a remakeutheres almost nothing else Even the brightness setting is buried in “calibration” rather than video settings Luckilythe games are all pretty old and dont require much to run anymore Thoughfor a remaster especiallyits disheartening to not even have things like an FOV slider Ultrawide support worksbut its got black bars on the side during cutscenes — whichin my experience of using ultrawide for the past year and halfits pretty common for “official 219 support” — but still very disheartening to not see it implemented properlyIve played them 35 times throughprior to this version Howeverone thing I cannot truly comment on is the differences that importing a save can do As I have never done it Essentially every playthrough of each game was a brand new Shepard to me Ive played ME1 and ME2 mostly on X360truth be told It wasnt until ME3 that I started playing on PC So from that aspect alonethis is version offers me something Ive never actually seenin thatyouve already played these games multiple times or youre somewhere between never having gotten into them or possibly having never even heard of them So its a moot point of contentionits still very much ME1 Youll need to spec into specific weapon types to do real damage Its most assuredly improvedin thatyou wont miss someone two feet away if youre not leveled into the weapon type nor will the sniper rifle sway be so absurd—as if Shepard had never held a weapon before But ME1 remains the most itraditionali as far as RPG elements of all the gamesME1 was not without faultsbsimilarities include the intro being action packedthen followed by an extreme amount of exposition in a semiconvoluted map Tedious tutorial quests posing as fetchquests give little to no urgency to the main story Essentially not telling the player that they could leave CitadelHinterlandsyoure unable to choose certain dialogue later on making certain situations impossible to have a favorable outcome without prior knowledge and preparationalmost completely devoid of any roleplaying aspects outside of dialogue choicesno longer weapon types—dictated rather by bclassb Which essentially boil down to three types bAdeptSoldier and Engineerb Specialists in BioticsCombat and Tech respectively Howeverthere are also what I call half n half classes in bVanguardb—BioticCombatbSentinelb— TechBiotic and finally bInfiltratorb— TechCombat These are persistent through the entire seriesthese are not inherently bad choicesI love me a good action game But Ive felt for a long time that when establishing a new IPshifting their core mechanics in this slightly offputtingif not pernicious way ended up taking away what made those games special in the first place Turning a fervent niche into a drabgeneric blockbuster hit for the masses This focusshift to action culminates in Andromedaas far as I can tell beven if importing a save You can also play differently as far as paragonrenegade—somewhere in the middle each game The way you play has more immediate effects Howeverthe games feature many imajori decisions that have far reaching — and often unforeseen — consequences going into the other gamesthe galaxy map is simply menu to be navigated In ME2there are no more sites to be landed on and explored with the Makoinstead youll find anomalies that youll shuttle down to The galaxy map becomes more interactable You directly control the ships movements and this costs fuel Resource gathering is then performed by scanning and sending probes down ME3 focuses on scanning and obtaining War Assetsconsider following my curation  — urlhttpsstoresteampoweredcomcurator229505Station ArgusurlquoteSo i used to play this game years ago on my older brothers Xboxnot understanding a thing that was going on My brother ended up passing away a couple years ago so when i saw that this game was being remastered i had to get it and see why my brother loved this game so much After beating it i saw why he loved this beautiful game and why he talked about it so much 1010 Great gameA great port Now if KOTOR gets similar treatment my life will be finishedI doubt there will ever be a trilogy like this againNewcomer to the series3 of the best games Ive ever playednothing else like itFeels like meeting a bunch of old friends Cant stop smilingIt has not just Garrusbut Garrusand Garrus againIt’s been five months since I finished the legendary editionand I still feel like I’m in mourning It’s akin to a first love Will I ever experience something like this again All games from now on face unfair comparison Though I’ll find enjoymentI still think to myself how much I miss that exhilarating feeling of falling in love with this seriesMass Effect 1 was the first game I ever completed on PC back in 200 or soand the entire Mass Effect trilogy remains one of my favourite gaming experiences of all time Naturally when I saw this Legendary Edition was priced at £599I was likenah Ive already paid for all these games on Origin Ive completed them I dont have time for this anyway Why would I go ahead and spend over £50 on itand I closed itthe choices I was going to makehow epic it would be to experience games 123 back to back rather than waiting years in between and forgetting half the detailsI bought it Ive sunk some time into the first one  which is arguably the one that needed a bit of TLC the most It may actually take me years to finish all three with the amount of free time I have lately screw youreal lifebut Im off to a good startreliving the experience Id forgotten how tough some of the decisions in the first game wereIve not experienced problems with bugs touch wood and it runs on my PC like a dream Playing the first game for a second time 12 years later has managed to capture both nostalgia and a fresh feel for me somehow Probably because Ive forgotten just enough detail to make half of it seem newwhilst remembering the other half Its a smoother experiencebut not streamlined or dumbed down for the masses phew Its kept that undefinable je ne sais quoi I was worried some of the atmosphere might be missing  but its definitely still there It still feels like something special But even betterbut this rerelease gave me the motivation to revisit one heck of an epic series and I have no regrets Dont expect any new reviews from me for some time thoughthis ones going to take a wee while to complete Ive even started looking at the achievements and wondering if I could 100 itwish me luckplease follow  urlhttpstoresteampoweredcomcurator2971565My Curator Pageurl 💖quoteThe Mass Effect trilogy is one of gamings greatest triumphs It was a product of BioWares golden age of imagination and creativity Not only that it changed the way people perceive the action RPG genrebut video games in generalbut also hope and compassion The lore and writing is so brilliantly presented and thoughtout That you end up experiencing the consequences in the third game because of your actions in the first No wonder its so easy to immerse yourself and dive right inand who will you become To the fate of the entire world being placed in your handssnappier combatgrander scale of eventsmore interesting companionssleeker gameplay and of courseeven more decisions for the player to make And the impact of your choices can be observed throughout the entire playthrough Entire civilizations can be saved or lostinnumerable amount of essential characters can survive or perishromances can thrive or wither The amount of things that can change from playthrough to playthrough is staggeringwill not only change the world around youbut also change you too Will you inspire people through love or fear  Will you be charming or intimidating  Some of my favorite trilogy moments stem from Shepards inspirational and compelling speeches But its not just Shepard that changeshis entire entourage of both familiar and alien allies changes tooso much potential Understanding how they thinktalking to them inbetween missions and figuring out what makes them tick was always one of my favorite things to do in Mass Effect You will no doubt end up having favoritesand thats normal Eventually you will start feeling a real connection and sympathy for at least one of your allies Whether it will be towards someone who is seeking absolution Or someone who is searching for a homeor a family Or just someone who is looking for a big ugly monster to beat the crap out of Who am I is a question that resonated strongly with me in particular LegionEDI and even Shepard are all faced with this question And you as a player have the ability to directly influence all of itbelongingselfsacrifice and peace Your role in this universe is much bigger than it seems at first You go from saving a tiny colonyto saving a planetto saving an entire solar systemto saving the galaxy and deciding the fate of every living thing in it But the universe demands balance And every decision for something is a decision against something elseit still looks and performs great Yesthe remaster enhances the textures and meshes and adds extra postprocessing But the aesthetics and overall scifi look of the game remains the same The set pieces are uniquevery different from planet to planet and memorable in their own way Nobody ever forgets their first Spectre induction or the adrenaline pumping suicide mission in Mass Effect 2 Some sections are more technically impressive than others But I think the fact this game can look so good using Unreal Engine 3 ten years down the lineis a major achievement in itselfbad or out of focus camera anglesnothing game breaking but theyre still there And to this day I couldnt find a way to disable the vignette effect without mods Speaking of modsI recommend using a couple to address the busy worksuch as instant planet probingskipping hacking minigamesinfinite galaxy map scanning Its not going to give you an unfair advantage or ruin your experience But its gonna save you a lot of timeespecially if this is your 5th time replaying the trilogyis that it can be a bit daunting You get all these emails sent to you inviting you to different places A bunch of new companionsnew locationsnew gear and things to keep an eye on Its definitely too muchtoo fasttoo soon for a new player Its like walking into a storeand have all ten clerks running at you Pushing each other to the sidefighting for your attention It can definitely be intimidatingand you have to make sure not to accidentally play the DLCs too soon or too late I suggest googling a DLC order list just to get your bearings With that saidI enjoyed the expansions and I liked how seamlessly they all transitioned With my favorite one being The Citadelwhich incidentally might be one of the best DLCs in gaming history And least favorite being Zaeedugh But even with all those omissionsI still strongly recommend playing the Legendary Edition over the originalsits just better in every wayId like to say that Mass Effect has a special place in my heart Even though I replayed the trilogy about five timesand I know exactly whats coming It still manages to make me as emotional as during my very first playthrough I dont know if its the really well written dialogues Or the brilliant chemistry and voice acting of the whole cast Could be the music and the way the cutscenes were directed Or perhaps its the fact that even though its set a hundred years into the future with all kinds of aliens and synthetics The nature of all life remains the same We still argue and make mistakeswe still have regrets and seek redemptionand were still learning to love not only our enemies but also ourselvesThe Lord of the Rings extended edition of video gamesfor the love of god add a FoV sliderFeels like coming homeThis review started as just pointing out the most noticeable changes in the Legendary Edition compared to the original editionsthen it transformed into regular reviews of each gameand ended with a rant about ME3 A stream of consciousness kind of a reviewif you willisnt After importing my Shepard from ME1 to ME2 I discovered that his eyebrows and stubble were missing and his skin became pasty white ie he looked sickly AF Had to reenter his ID code in Custom Appearance menu to be able to modify him Should have been a separate option without needing to do so From ME2 to ME3 his hair and skin were finebut his eyes became much larger I checked  its the same set of eyesthey are just bigger in ME3 Weirdcompared to the rest of the series The planet exploration elementalong with the Makowere some of my favorite momentsdespite the overwhelming jankinessbetter looking assets taken from later games and improved lighting which makes the game look newer by about 5 years Noverias Port Hanshan doesnt look as bland anymore It is a bit too dark at times thoughespecially Feroswhich was locked to 30 in the older PC portheadshots have been addedthe gameplay upgrade is impressive aside from the streamlining of gear upgrades and inventory management Each class has now a distinct abilitywhich makes them unique compared to the others The person who came up with the Vanguard Charge must have had a true revelation its arguably the best addition to the series as a whole And then theres the scanning minigamewhich is just a mistake of nature The hacking minigames are an improvement thoughbut in ME2 its even betterespecially in the DLCs often epic and grandiose The hubs are much smaller than the Citadel from ME1but each of them is distinct and presents some breathtaking landscapes The ambient in clubs such as Afterlife is still impressive a decade since releasebut its not as noticeable as it is in ME1arguably the best armor in ME2is available on Illiumespecially when using sniper riflesnot sure though Twice the game froze on a black screen after selecting squadmates during the Suicide Mission I had to kill the process I think I did it too fast and doing it a bit slower is the workaround No crashessome of the animations are just bad or broken eg the activating ammo power animation which worked perfectly fine in ME2the hacking minigames were removed altogetherand the only hub in the game is the Citadel which is separated into small floors There is also a ton of listen to NPC and find arbitrary item somewhere in the game world quests taken straight from Dragon Age 2 A clear sign of not enough timethe combat is much faster than in the previous installments movement in and out of cover is much quickersprinting is infinitecooldowns are shorterand you can dodge Weapon modding and upgrading were reintroducedas well as weight was added which influences length of cooldownswhile walking around the Citadel you are no longer in armor and your squadmates are using their shore leave by themselves instead of following you everywhere they also communicate with each other on the Normandyespecially seen in eg refugee camps on the Citadel Its well contrasted with the often humorous camaraderie between Shepard and his squadmates its amped up to 11paving the way for some of the best fan service ever written in video gamesand thats not counting Citadel DLCit is a good game it has some strong writinglike Tuchanka or Rannoch arcs… but then you have a lot of autodialogue from Shepard and generally much fewer dialogue choices throughout Cerberus being everywhere and as powerful as the Empire from Star Wars for no reason Kai Lengan antiShepardbeing only fleshed out in the novels ie if you never read themtough luckyou don’t even know who he ishour long YouTube videosand forum posts of epic proportionsall disseminating what was wrong with it I can only add that it disappointed me so greatlythat I returned to Mass Effectas a franchiseonly now thanks to the Legendary Edition To put it bluntlythe original ending was so badthat I did not play any Mass Effect game for nearly a decade not counting the ME3 multiplayer It was not about having each and every decision reflected in the ending I knew that was literally impossible to develop It was about having closure and the ending being satisfying I received none of those The Extended Cut is infinitely betteras it does provide some closurebut it still is rather nonsensical given the themes throughout the series and even ME3 itself Leviathan also adds some context to italong with more dialogue options in the ending I will end it herebecause this is what it actually is The ending soured so manythat only 3 metric tons of fan service could sweeten it up Sadbut multiple visual errors carried over from the original release are still presentME LE is worth itthough I had hoped they have fixed ME3’s technical issuesjust as they did in ME1 At this point it’s more janky than ME1 Beautiful K graphics with HDRrefining an almost perfect franchiseWrexdo you WANT us to arrest youbased and Wrexpilledh1iIm not sure if turian heaven is the same as yours but if this thing goes sideways and we both end up theremeet me at the bar I’m buyingih1and it includes the entire trilogy and their respective DLCs Right off the batif you haven’t played the trilogy and love storydriven gamesthen go ahead and buy it at full price Before we beginI should note that I only played the original iMass Effect 2iand a small portion of the first game a few years ago0 DLCs and amazing expansionsand only one launcherwith incredible charactersrich lore and unforgettable momentsnot so much for the second and thirdand you take the role of Shepardthe commander of the SSV Normandy You are tasked to find and recover an alien beacon in one of the human coloniescalled Eden Prime After investigating the colonyyou successfully locate the beacon Howeverit somehow activates and Shepard receives a vision of the future deathdestructionwar and extinctionand they are all caused by an unknown powerful enemy It is now a race against time to find out what the visions mean and save the galaxy from its inevitable doom In order to avoid spoilersthis is the plot of the first gamewhich is either bParagonb sympathycompassionhumblenessetc or bRenegadeb intimidatedisrespectetcand they are measured using a morality meter There are extra dialogue options that you can unlock by reaching a certain point of that meterdepending on your morality These choices will influence certain events later onand even carry over to the next gamethe trilogy has one of the most wellcrafted storylines in gamingso it’s easy to become invested in itin addition to the unforgettable characters and companionsincredible lorehaunting enemiesgripping missionsmemorable and tearjerking momentsdifficult choices that can lead to massive consequences laterfascinating locations to visit around the galaxy and interesting alien racesas you can level up your character and choose different talents and abilities When it comes to gameplay and combatthere are some differences between the threewhich I will talk about later At the start of the gameyou can either choose the defaultlooking Shepard male or femaleor customize your own character After thatyou can choose one of the classes that are presenteddepending on what talents and abilities that you want to take to the fieldbut instead use the “overheat system” where the weapon overheats the more you fireAlsoyou are fixed to choosing  types of weapons pistolassault rifleshotgun and sniper riflea lot of gameplay improvements were made aiming feels so much better nowimproved inventory management mark items as junk and convert them to omnigel at once and you can finally sprint out of combat even though the running animation looks weird The most notable improvement is the Mako you will be using a vehicle in half of the missions to traverse through difficult terrains and long distances in various planetsand driving it feels a lot smoother nowcompared to the original with its lackluster controls and slow speedME2  ME3 have improved combat and gunplaywhile dumbing down on the RPG elements no more weapon modes and inventoryuniversal ammo thermal clips instead of the overheat systemsmaller open areas and no more vehicle missions if you don’t count two ME2 DLCsyou aren’t limited to  weapon types anymore depends on the class of your choosingshooting enemies feels more satisfyingfaster sprint and at longer distancesand better companions in my opinion They removed planet exploration and replaced it with planet scanning minigameswhich are repetitive and monotonous ThankfullyME3 rarely has them bAs for the remastered versionsbthere weren’t any noticeable changesand they are hard to keep track of You should play them in the right order to get the best experienceso I recommend looking up a guide onlinetry to catch up with your crew and companionschances are that you will unlock new conversationsupgrade optionsand side missions that may have vital consequences in the futurenext gameyou can change it when you import your save file to ME2ME3beautiful lightingless blurry and more complex texturesand significantly betterlooking environments and As for ME2I didn’t notice any significant change compared to the originaland I assume the same applies to ME3since the original games still look decent to this dayIntel I91050k32 GB RAMWindows 10 Homeusome of which even existed in the original games enemies clipping on wallscharacter models firing in the wrong direction but still hit the targetShepard not blinking during conversations at times ME1 onlyand characters disappearing during conversations I also experienced multiple crashes ME2 especiallyand FPS dropswhich always happen inside the citadel in all three games With that being saidit’s not as bad as it soundsas they ran smoothly almost all the timeincluding Jack Walland they really help build the mood and futuristic atmosphere of the gameswith their synth and piano music My favorite songs have to be “Leaving Earth” from ME3as it perfectly captures the enemies’ scale and powerand “Suicide Mission” from ME2as it is played during one of the greatest missions in all of gamingamazing and memorable charactersfun and intense gameplaygreat visualstopnotch songs and now all in one package If you are new to the seriesthen I highly recommend buying it at full priceas for players who already played the entire package beforeI recommend buying it on saleas the only major differences are the graphic overhaul of the first game and improved few gameplay aspectsfollow our curator pagebDevils in the DetailbquoteurlBack in 200 Mass Effect was the first game that I bought without reading any reviews or anything else At this time I didnt know that Ill love the sagaI can easily say that its simply the best remaster game nowadays Not a lazy one with just higher retexture and thats all Nothe Legendary Editionlightstons of quality of life tweaksHDRetcMass Effect Legendary Edition includes all DLCs more than 00 DLC and a hundred hours of fun Ive 1 hours Steam recorded and still things to do one of the best RPGs ever that features nice character creationchoices

on the citadel
1,I managed to get some time in with FtK some just after full release and over the past couple of monthsspecific events are on a timer which can be mitigated or even removed by a players actionsthe game still suffers from great mechanics cheaply implementedhumour and variation and youll get a good amount of play time out of itif I miss this shot which Ive pumped up to 99 chance to hitthe last monster with  hit point will crit against my hero with 30 hit points left with 3 damage Yup It dodged Yupmy healer is dead Called itjust shut it down for a whilework off the rage quit and come back until it all happens againsome great music and a very fresh take on an RPG as a roguelikeif it runs outmakes progress that much more difficult the Chaos mechanic Players must decide if they have enough time to go down into that cave to perhaps find loot and experience but risk elevating the danger inhibiting the ability to complete their main goalsoften having to weigh the odds and consequences of failure against the often unknown benefits of taking such riskshealing herbsequipmentarmor and weapons that match the ever more difficult monsters and encounters are rare and as the quest progressesmore expensive to buy in towns And this is the first design point where I think  the developers dont trust their own systems enough In the first act a healing herb in limited supply to start with costs about the same anmount of gold the player can get by winning one encounter In the second act the cost increases not incrementally but by huge factor about 5 times or so and in futher acts this rises at the same exponential rate So much so that buying even one healing herb is so prohibitive it isnt a considerationfrom one to five or six coins are shown and the RNG determies the success or failure of each coin flip based on the associated stat For some abilities to be successfulall of the coin flips must be successful so the higher of number of successes needed the less of chance the action is a success Players can also spend focus to assure that one or more of the coins come up a success and the player needs to balance using focus for critical situations And here again is  where I think the developers need more confidence in their own designsI dont think the odds shown to the player are entirely accurate I tested this out using some old fashioned cardcounting and an abacuswhich doesnt produce exact mathematical results but certainly points out some possible weightings over time It seems that if players face higherlevel monsters and some weaponsnegative modifiers are applied to the roll but not displayed I think this may be where some of the cries of cheating are coming from The RNG seems very good in noncombat situations such as overland challenges and disarming traps so the discrepency seems very odd for just combat This may just be a bugoversight but if it is an intentional design decisionespecially in a game so dependent on randomnessit masks an implemetaion issue and is point of frustration at design rather than a challenge of a gamebut always have a lower chance of success which is actually displayed and usually require more successes than a normal attack For example a basic stike could have three rolls at 67 per roll inflicting some damage per success but a special attack has five rolls at 47 each and requires each roll to succeed  Its a bit of a doublewhammy intended to push the player to use Focus which provides a challengebut it also seems that even if the attempt is successful the monsters have a good chance to avoid the effect While the game does display what effects the monsters are rightout immune tofar too often using special abilities instead of basic attacks have too low a chance of success and a waste of time when a basic attack has a better chance of at least doing something of useit does succeeds four out of five times While the monsters should be better and more dangerous than the heroesthe incredibly high success rate of monsters especially when they need to make so many successes and do so easiliymakes it seem like they are not subject to the same game rules as the player It feels likenot so much cheating per sebut simply cheapexteremely low success rates of secondary player abilities to bypass their own design Its almost a shame because it seems a reevaluation of the power escalation as well as the configuation of the system rather than the system itself which seems solid would shift this perception significantlyor rather the specific configurations of the mechanicsare to me what is holding back what is at its core a fantastic gamebut in its current state that thumb is a very tentative Im still going to be playing and following the development of this game because of its potential for greatnessits a bit like playing a really difficult DD campaign but everything is faster paced and I can control more than one guyyour character will flip a coin 5 timesand if he gets all of the coins 00 then he does max damage if he gets none of the coins he experiences a critical failurejust like in DDand he can get punished for it For one instanceif your weapon is fragile or breakablea critical failure will break that weapon for the rest of the game and youll have to find another one or use your old weaponDO NOT SLEEP ON THIS GAME Seriously I had this game in my library forever and thought it would be just another roguelike cash grab but I was so wrong This game is what I wished that gloomhaven would beand if that dosent sell it for you then I dont know what will The balance is so perfect where you always have to think and the punishing badluck moments are usually recoverable if you plan ahead  It scratches the dopamine roll itch very well too if you are the kind of guy who gets a little too into modifiable luckadjacent mechanics like dicey dungeons or autochess One of my new all time favorites Im confident to saymost CoDBF games dosent mean they all are the same but to me they are so I dont see the nuances and so on This game has a lot of subsystems like economyresource managementmassive explorationinteresting loot to be gained in most interactions and so on If the game was simplyas the screenshots led me to believe a follow one of a few branching paths and try to survive until the end like Slay the spire but without the deckbuilding I thought for a long time the experience would be bareboned Granted I start the review by saying do not sleep on this game since I did for so long I know I did not give the game a chance and I regret thatcheck in if you want and feel free to ask me anything that confuses youI absolutely love this gameand it is by far the best random game buy I have ever madeevery board is uniqueand even 0 games in you will find equipment you have never seen beforeto what rewards to pursueto what pressing threat you should be addressingmatters And that is just moving around the boardeach combat is its own puzzle to solvewithout watering down the difficulty Fun cosmetic options tooI love this gamebut the catch isFP is a very finite resource And sometimesyou just get screwed Part of the fun of challenging strategy games like this is learning how they workand when you first start playing you dont know what you dont know So when you get Ambushed and all your gold stolenit feels unfair the first time it happens Howeverfrom that point on you know that is thing that can happenand it is on you to prepare for itbut one of the most frustrating things about that game and this one was the feast or famine with what items were available to buy from shops on any given run Not whether or not you could afford what you wantedwhether or not the store had anything worth buying AT ALL This game has that a bit tooand it can be pretty frustrating I wish they would have made it so each biome had at least one guaranteed weapon and armor piece for each main attack stat between the two locationsbut it takes a few nights to finish a run It would be cool if they  made a shorter game mode that tops out at level 5 and is completeable in a single sitting like FTLSo Ive noticed quite a few salty reviews on this game and this saddens me greatly Ive played multiple playthroughs and had terrible luck on some and amazing luck on a few as wellland that crazy hitor make the perfect save A trade off for the rewarding feeling is that it will punish you greatly for mistakes and wrong turnsfrustratedExtremely happylaughingand most of all satisfied with this game if you enjoy a challenge The game is still early acces but the Devs are superb and much more content is in the works Steel your nerves and prepare for an adventurechallenging but rewardingA load of fun with a few matesGreat game My wife and I are geographically separated and it’s one of the few games we can play together and enjoy She’s not a gamerso finding games she can play without getting frustrated is tough She likes the game so much she even plays it when I’m not aroundwhich is saying a lot since she pretty much NEVER plays gamessomething we’ve been wanting for awhile now Thanks team for putting this together I’m looking forward to more content and other games your company makesVery fun to playeven if you have no friends to play with A great RPG with many hours of content to enjoy and a high difficulty levelbut technically a little simpleFun even when you lose 8 hours of progress to a bug that immediately gets patched by the devs when you complainthanks devsWell this one is certainly a hidden gem And one I wouldnt have normally discovered Dont be put off by the strange graphic style which is initially grating as I almost was Dont be put off by the fact that it LOOKS like a casual mobile game as I almost was Instead be completely taken aback by how good it ishow it has more depth than a great many more expensive titleshow all its extra scenarios were given free rather than being used to milk more money as DLCsand how its great as a single player game and even more fun as a coop title A solid 90 with bags of replay valueFor the King is a must buy for the majority of gamersFun gamebut inherent design flaws make game extremely frustratingprocedurally generated hex grid setuprandom encounters and more make the game feel like playing an elaborate board game but on your PC The problem is that the developers came up with too many different ways to make the game difficultand then made almost the entirety of the game luck based Even the decisions that can be made come down to do I feel lucky to try this challenge without using limited resources HealingFocusetcor do I want to try to use up these rare resources now and hope I get lucky enough to get more later Almost all decisions have huge luck elementsand luck is not on your side most of the timethe real difficulty comes with the onetwothree punches ofwhich clashes with or maybe one or two survive to raise the deceased which may not be possible and will further reduce your time to complete the quest even if it ishaving permadeath in roguelikes was to make decisions matter and avoid ruining the game by letting people savescum Howevertheres too much RNG in this game to make that an appropriate difficulty mechanism hereas decisions just often come down to luck The game would be much more enjoyable if they get rid of the time limits andor the permadeath featuresat least as an option in the difficulty selection  The developers have had about 50 of the players telling them this exact same thing I had heard one dev complain that the time restriction was critical to the essence of the gamedespite so many people begging for the option to remove it Hopefully theyll listen to their playersDont let the play time above fool you Between various accounts and system changesIve put in well over 000 hours into this gamesince then I had become one of the original 5 WikiFounders and went out of my way to send as much praise as I could about the game toward othersMonstersMore LootUnlockablesMORE LootInteresting Story and even MORE LOOTyoure going to enjoy thisbeneath is a roiling beast which hungers for nothing more than to make you suffer in a good wayafter putting in a ticket one of the Developers themselves directly assisted me in recovering my unlocks and lore progressionI cannot recommend this game enoughSo after 4 Attempts I finally beat it with a BuddyI truly enjoyed The GameIt has Great High Risk high Reward gameplay We made it through with a hunterblacksmithbusker here are my pros and ConsIt is Way to expensiveDrop it maybe 50 GoldKilling them sometimes doesnt reward the item backIm looking forward to what is to comeIf you think 85 percent chance is a good odd● IN SHORThard to masterIll start off by saying that if I had paid what I did for the early access version in the state it was when I got it and that was the completed gameI would be completely happy with itand there are times when youll have easier or more difficult time due to the mapthe enemiesand events that happen That will turn some people off But I think those two combined work Yesyoull replay the first few stages a lotbut even though the general sequence of events are the samethe run will be different every time Youll get different mapsdifferent enemiesand different gear Plus different party compositions result in different sorts of gamesI generally couldnt get through the first act now I routinely get to the third though I have only beaten the third act once So there is a feel that you are advancing in the game even if you are restarting the story Some people have said that you have trouble fighting the enemies even at equal level Ive found that I can routinely take on enemiesdungeons a level higher than my partyalthough theyll cost a decent amount of healthresources and in the case of dungeonsmay result in a couple of characters dyingwhich in itself is not permanentas you can revive them at the cost of increasing chaoslosing their sanctum With decent gear and tacticsthe fights are very manageablebut you do have time to take fights and explore a bit You dont do much explorationbut its not an exploration gamethe maps not set up for it Its not a game over if you run out of timeeither Its a balance between taking time to level your characters and getting objectives donedont just beeline each story objectiveyoull be underlevelledif youre looking for an adventure game thats focused on fighting and levelling rather than exploringand that has high replayabilitythis is a good game Dont expect it to be something its notand its very fun I would definitely recommend ittldr the game doesnt feel finished yetsome really inspired mechanicslots of good ideas I had never played a game like For the King hexcell overworldturnbased combatso I cant say which ideas are original and which were inspired by other gamesthere are plenty of things to doand any direction you walk in is as likely to be profitable as any other You might not notice how great the first round is until youve reached the lategame content at least oncesometimes the monsters wont drop anything Thats typical for RPGs not everything is guaranteed Youre not supposed to grind for equipmentthoughbecause drop rates are too low and also you gain experience from doing thatwhich is the worst thing that can happen to you At level  youll start seeing mechanics your level0equipped party cant handle Enemies that cant be hit unless you roll your attacks perfect Enemies that put the Shocked debuff on you to prevent you from rolling perfectly unlesss you dodge their attack Enemies who do both of those things at oncemaking it functionally impossible to hit them until you can dodge their attack and break the cycle Enemies who take items or money from your cashstarved partyor who destroy the few bits of equipment you might findthen vanish and leave you totally brokewithout you even getting a turn in the combat Just two leprechaun turnsthen the fight is over and youre poor Its basically just a cutscene You can avoid this by having certain passives unique to rarelowlevel pieces of equipment that you might have found but will almost certainly need to sell to buy real gear very soonbut you dont have the luxury of gearing up first because of the many ticking clock mechanicsif you let it stack three times Scourges debilitating negative effects that last until you find and defeat a correlated boss in the overworld also demand attentionthe whole game gets harder Prices multiply far beyond the price range of even a welloff party The two reliable sources of healing Godsbeard herb and resting at an inn will soon be individually more expensive than the totality of your characters possessionsbut those will send you even further out of your way and will waste one of the limited opportunities to lower the Chaos level that you getyou have to choose between quests that award money and those that lower the Chaosjust because they can hit pixiesthievesimpsleprechaunsbirdsetcbut you dont have much freedom to do so You cant afford to make an invincible tank by routing all HP and Armor gear to your Blacksmith After allits much more likely that the enemies will attack your unprotected Herbalist or Scholar So you need to armor everyone pretty much equallywhich means nobody can rise to be a paragon of their role This makes people who like to make builds sadI dont like having to discard Intelligence gear because my Scholar needs more Vitality and Armoronly one character should need to be physically resilient the tank To have a tank at allthoughyou need to have the ability to tauntwhich you dont There is a Taunt skillbut it requires a perfect roll to executewhich is usually around a 50 success rate If it failsyou wasted a whole turn Being an ability one would use in an emergencyyou can never afford to risk skipping your turnand so Taunt is not a relevant mechanicMOST abilities are not relevant There are many status effects and debuffs you can theoretically put on enemiesand sometimes they might give you an upper handbut theyre all attached to lowsuccessrate skills and require perfect rolls on top of that I dont know why it cant just be one or the otherbut the result is that its just not worth using most abilities in the game Standard attacks are almost always the only optionand I think a lot of variety is lost herethe way most parties will be getting around is by walkingso you have three pieces on the board who all need to move at approximately the same speed They wont move at the same speed Some classes are slowand movement is governed by Speed rolls Sometimes one character will move six tiles and the next will move only one Youre only as fast as your slowest characterso a lot of the time youll be taking a single step and calling it a day You can have your faster characters scout ahead you pretty much have to but they cant do any kind of combat when theyre off on their own unless you want them to die so at the end of the day your party is only as fast as your blacksmithwhen you reach the Poison Bog biome and see that each turn nets your slow old blacksmith three Speed rolls worth of movement and he fails all but one every single round youre going to get a little frustrated Especially if you dont have something to prevent poisonwhich is debilitating and worsens your rolls even moreand I have come to believe that there is no such real part waiting for meThis game is wonderful and means a lot to me and my partner For usplaying this

1,Been fishing in this game for over 8 hours now and havent caught a single russianAvoid at all costsRF4 staff bans innocent playersbut RF4 staff members act abusive when facing criticismit is well known that they abuse their power regarding forum activity YesterdayI reported a bug that remained unfixed although they were told about it before christmas events patches The bug led to my reel being heavily damagedthus leading further to a loss of silver due to a lack of interest in fixing that bug I reported it The tone was fermno offensive language has been usedI can prove it with screenshots They deleted my report and gave me a warning for aggresive behaviour They did not address the bugthey ignored it I am a paying playerI invested in this gameI support their shitty attitudeso I wont take warnings from lazy devs I wrote again in the criticism section funny they have onethey are unable to take any kind of criticism No offensive languagesame ferm tone Next thingthey issue an IP ban

exactly what lazy game devs do Are they lazy Yup They could easily find out that the two other players had other connections in the pastwith different IPs and I was the only one to write and play from the same IPconstantly Yetthey were too lazy to research thatresulting in a banning of innocent players This is the end of RF4 for meI will not support childish developers who had some unity tutorials on YT and believe they now own their game They dont Paying players do I am not saying you should stop playing rf4that is your choice But I would be really careful where I invest my moneysince RF4 has

buy gear with gold coins to continue fishing In the future I expect more of a hybrid system for revenue with a mix of goldbait and gold coins for gear hours well I have now elapsed 3 hours So maybe the question I should have been asked is not would I refer this to my friends To would I continue to play it moreand you will lose less players to frustration uAhRussian Fishing 4but yet one that i advice you as a player to stay away from even after having played it for nearly 7 hours myself Howeverthe reason may not be what you would immediately expect So let us not get ahead of ourselvesand instead first examine the pros and cons of the gamealthough i came closetemperature and time but also things like line typeline sizeleader sizeattachment visibilitygear and tackle qualitiesfish migrationbait preference changes and much morelet us move on to the consthe lake progression path does not make sense This will often leave new players frustrated with broken gear fishing at places they do not have the correct gear for yet or simply no or few fishthe crafting progression does not make sense In RF4 you learn to harvest baits as well as making groundbait and lures Howeveroften in those progressions what you learn does not match the actual lakefish availabilitythe store stock system especially will leave new players frustrated Every lake has a certain set of stores in which many items will say out of stock For most items that actually means will never be in stockbut the game does not explain this Furthermorecrafting requirements often need components from particular lakes that do not fit with general player progression In some cases when the player finally reaches a checkpoint in craftingthey have passed the need for that craft in the first placethere is a large list of bugsmany of which are not recognized by the game management even though every old player know that they are present These bugs include but are not limited to chat lagIDs appearing instead of player namesstore lagselling lagghost bitesstrange fish got away streaks that sometimes do not make any sense at all and much morethere is more to be said about the game You seethe game includes a place called the penalty pond or popularly called the prison pond This place is a specific lake map players are sent to if they for some reason have a falling out with the management of the game Having a falling out with the management can entail everything from what you normally see moderated in other games by a profanity filter to posting something on the forum or discord that is not the the general liking of the managementyou will get a notification that you have to catch X amount of weight of fish to get out again Mind youthe fish in the prison pond i am told are all smallso having to f ex catch 1 kilos of fish may very well take a very long time Not exactly a fun prospect in a game which a player originally decides to play for just that  funyou may suddenly find yourself on the receiving end of the stick for a supposed violation that you do not understand or agree with And at this point you will have no choice but to bow down and catch your small penalty fish effectively wasting your time and metaphorically speaking agreeing that you were rightfully penalizedor quit the game It does not matter if you have played 1 hours1 hours or 1 hours The management are generally not open for debatebut that you could get away with misspelling or abbrevations of such wordshaving never gotten sent to prison pond and considering myself a loyal playerat some point replied with a harmless personal opinion which included a four letter foul word I did not think anything of it until about an hour later i found myself being teleported to prison pondsince i felt that the issue must have been a wrongly automated action I was abruptly shut down and told that i violated the terms of service with a blacklisted word in my sentence I then read through the whole of Russian Fishing 4s EULA yeahi had not read it beforehandthese days how many actually read these very large agreements written in legal speak To my large surprise i found nothing in the EULA stating that the sentence i wrote was in violation of ithighlighting the parts of the EULA that could have had relevance but did not in my case Howeverinstead of having an adult conversation with the moderatorsmy post was deleted I then reposted it It got deleted This repeated itself 45 times until an administrator posted a reply stating that i asked for an explanation of the ban and i got it Ofcourse the administrator posted one of my earlier posts instead of the post where i was pointing out that i was not in violation of the EULA which is terribly convenient At the same time my posts were marked for moderation approvalwhich in other words meant that i was cut offbut it comes with a serious flipside to the coin In its current state i can not recommend itas you as a player might get hit with the same misfortune as i dideffectively wasting very many hours of otherwise enjoyable playand captured screenshots of the conversations so that you as a potential new player will know what you will be up against before deciding to playand i apologize for that Regardlessshould you decide to play anyway you may want to have the above in mind Good luck and have fun This game is a Korean grinder but in Russian style Why Let me startits a free gamewhat do you expect but nobelieve me  this game only looks free Be preared that without golden coins bought for real money and Premium pass you will acheve i wanted to use four letter word used for stool First few hours of game are pretty fun  quite good leveling tempo but when you will get to level around POOF you join an elite group of russian fishermen who goes fishing just to drink vodka You stil cath the fish like before but you realize that they are worthagain a word for stool Prices for gear are ridiculousand i mean RIDICULOUS After 18 hours of grinding for best gear you can make like 115 siver per real time 15 hours and good medium class rod is like 15reel is the same and line plus bait another 3 Then you realize that you must have the skill to get more fish and guess what  skill goes quite fast for first few levels you want to use ground bait sureprepare couple of thousand silver coins to level the groundbait making and clisk on crafting for few hours I have houndreds of groundbaits made and still have around 5 of skill tree  Be also aware that with certain percent of skill you unlock another ingredients the same goes for all other skill trees You want to catch a fish with good price to sell Forget itwithout a proper groundbait you will only catch some trash species not worth catching On low levels you can only catch certain species of fish which arecommon and worth that most of the server resets and patches are ruining most of the water bodies bite rates and your spots If you will find a spot where you can get decent fish for farming silverbe sure that devs will show you their middle finger and reset it very soonyou will not be able to use it anyway that is so well designed  no shortcutsgrind or paygo on waste your time MAybe you will end like me thinking maybe this was all a bad joke and now ill start to get some good fish I can tell you straight away  No NeverfishfishAlrightI got 16 hours into this gamemade it to high level to play all the mapsand now I feel I can give my honest review of the gamemeaning there is at no point of the game you need to purchase anything to continue playing EXCEPTthat it isand I will explain howyou start out as a character that has never fished beforehas a limited amount of moneyand is trying to start out As you go to enter the tackleshopyou see reels and rods in the thousands of silver costand you started out with a measely 5 silver So you thinkshouldnt be too hard to save up Wrong Each fish you catch will average about 5 silverif you catch a nice size fishit will jump up to about 1ish at low levelsif you catch a trophyit will be around 1 silver for the fishbut a trophy fish is extremely rareonly 1 caught out of the 16 hours of fishing I have put into this game By the time you make it to level 1you might have enough silver to buy a LEVEL 5 SET UPand at this lakeare fish that will literally destroy itor take 45 minutes of your time away trying to land a fish worth 5 silverbut the thing isnow you need level 16 gear AT LEAST to land these fishand these reels and rods will be about 914 silver EACHso you will be looking at 1 hours of grindingand not spending any of itjust to get a reel Then as your usin that reel to save for a better rod or say even anotheryou will start to notice it just doesnt have the stopping power it use tooh guess whatyou got to repair it Repair costs for the reel will be anywhere from 37 of the cost of the reel to just repairno this game does not have a pay to win wall where you cannot advance anymore It has one discretelygiving you the option to continue the game for free and literally not get anywhereor buy gold and premium time to repair your rod and reels without spending insane amount of silveralong with no wait time I would much rather pay 6 for a gamethan a free to play game with microtransactionsif it was not for some people to pass down there gear to me at lower levelI wouldnt of even commited 1 hours into this game EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GET STARTED ALL THE SHOPS ARE OUT OF LOW LEVEL GEARNO INTENTION OF A FIXcant get out fishingand just simply love to fishbut todayI cannot recommend the game for anyone to try given its current statebut the grind isnt fun to me anymoreGraphicsfishThis game once was the best fishing simulator there was offered but has fell far from grace over the past year  I seen hints on how this game and the dev team is behind the scenes let me explain When I first started playing this game and watching the guides on youtube I heard about this long time player named BIGWRM I was on the forums one night and seen that he had been posting concerns about the game and he got black listed on the site where no one could see his post just because he was giving rightful criticism Lately this game has went the route of cutting the amount of fish actively caught by players to near nothing in the hopes of players spending real money to buy premium items people are leaving this game in droves I post this review knowing full well that it could result in my account being banned for a negative review but I no longer care about a game that at one time brought my inner fisherman so much joy I cant recommend this game to anyone anywhere at anytimeMy wife wont let me go fishing in the middle of Covid19so Im testing the waters here So far this is an okay replacement to fishing in real life The water looks as smooth as I remember itthe fish still cause a ruckus and my wife still yells at me to spend time with the kids There is a nice variety of fish and locationsIve caught a few fish here that I havent yet in the real world The one thing I wish it had was proper multiplayer Theres a chat but thats about ityou cant actually see other players My good friend Lloyd and I have been playing this together and I do wish we could cast our lines side by side like we used to Overallthis isnt a real replacement to fishing but it is a darn fine one for the time being Cant wait to be back out catchin carp in the old rowboatI had given this game several chances becaue I do see quite a bit of potential herebut as is it is far from a finished product and shows it everywhere  The thing that made me give up is the attitude of the devs and admins  They see any feed back that isnt 1 posative as an affront and just argue with and insult players looking for helpone of the head admins on the forums and in disccalled me lazygame me conflicting and false info about game mechanics and perma banned me from disc for insulting him once in frustrationfish on this reservoir could change their habitats and baits preferencesjust that it could have  Never mind that populations were adjusted gives about as little info as possible  From playing the game it seems that this means that fish will just stop biting all together for no apparent reasonor just jump off your hook simultaniously happening to groups of people fishing in the same area at the same time despite doing everything that is supposed to prevent this and getting no feedback what causes it other than bad rnggroundbait makes the fish you catch bigger rather than increasing the rate at which you catch fish  This is counter to common sense of how groundbait worksmy experience with using it in the gameand the ingame tool tip which reads use groundbaits to catch more fishalmost all positive after having mixed reviews for monthsOver zealous moderatorscausing untold damage to equipment which is expensive to repairthe game could be awesomeif the devs sorted out the ridiculous economyoverpowered fishrepair costs and nerfing the watersThis is the worst fp game on the market currently The team managing this game are the greediestmost incompetent and shady The adminElwoodiath runs all communication like a dictatorHitler There is absolutely no tolerance for criticism or even a hint of negative tone Imagine you are frustratedyou go on to discord and ask a question while saying something likeis this seriously meant to be a fun mechanism As soon as the admin or a mod sees your postit will be deleted andor you being banned The admin has threatened to ban me or worseIm not kiddingthats exactly what he said So the level of professionalism doesnt existall I have seen are nerfsaddition of bugsaccidental addition of content thats broken and not ready for public release yet and a new map for high level players that is littered with bugs The team is so incompetent that I have not seen a single patch note that fixes the many bugs of the game I dont know if they dont care or if they just dont know how to fix the game To give you an exampleat night in the Tunguska mapthe moon will appear in front of the tree box Its a joke and people have mentioned several times over the months and its still not been fixedall they are doing is adding grindnerfs and more content so people buy premium and  No bug fixes and  communication with the players No one knows when the next content patch is or if its a bug fix patch There is  communication btw the devs and the players How is this EA thenPaul RF4 Megasheetthe first result is his excel sheet that just about everyone uses for this game He reasearched and made an excel sheet on the best ways to grind the game What happened was one day there was a quick patch and it was brought to the teams attention that a secret nerf took place After stating the facts and questioning the devs why the patch notes didnt mention themPaul was warned and later on banned He was a good guy and geniunly helped the community His last words are over in his sheetyou are supporting the greediest dictatorsjoke of a fp game Is this what you want to see all fp gaming companies do I wouldnt be surprised if this was posted on discord or foum and a moddevadmin saw it and banned me on the forum and ingame right awayAvoid if you know what is good for your WALLETbut INCREASE prices for silver for in game gear in order to try to extort players for money On top of thistop end reels in game can cost as much as if not more UPDATE I just checked the most expensive reel which is around 1 Gold in game This would cost 4 according to their website Completely absurduntil March  I sincerely wish I never spent a cent on this stupid piece of crapnot to mention what my added up total came up towhich I am totally not proud ofthey are just shady and greedy bastards whom care for nothing else but profiting off of naive player base whom continue to pay themwhich is why I feel it is necessary to report their behaviorthus forcing players to spend real money to be able to buy gear On top of all thistheir prices for gold and gear are absolutely absurdconsidering that for one single reel in game bought for goldone could easily buy a legitimate starter fishing kit IRL for less than what they charge for virtual gear Alsothe game encourages spending goldwhich is purchased for moneyand the prices are downright absurd I wish I could post a screenshot herebut for comparisons sakejust look at their website and convert the gold prices for top end gear to real money if you truly want to give yourself a heart attack This game should be abolished from existencegreedy developers like these guys should not be allowed to operate on this scaleyou might ask The answer is NOT THAT MUCH Good luck grinding you life away if you do not want to spend real life moneyand also THIS GAME WILL NEVER BE OUT OF THE BETA STAGEAS HAS BEEN THE CASE FOR LAST  YEARSset up a new free to play account and do not support these greedy bastards  And for the players who contribute by paying for their Premium Subscriptionheed this warning add up the amount of money you have spent on premium alone and you may just become shockedjust like I wasthey would not have reskinned mosquito lake They would have developed a new map But their laziness and greed definitely got the better of them Heed this warningA streamer sponsored by the game got caught scamming his viewers on video and admins and devs decided to witch hunt the people who showed the proof insteadthey just wanna make money and thats why the game is a grindfestthey only care about taking your money they ban players who have made comments on how the game could be improved the admin team will advise you to come off steam an download there client version to avoid paying steam they should not only be removed from steam but should not be a game at all until they consider the players without them you have nothingRussian Fishing is the best fishing sim out there I have played it since before it was translatedway before the Steam release The amount of available tacklefeed and bait are jaw dropping UnfortunatelyI still would not recommend it to anyone in its current stateto reach lv I need around 15K XP The average fish on the map Old Burg nets me XP right now And thats rounding upyoull find that this is a beta and rules can change One dayrods can be repaired Suddenlyrules change and your expensive rod can become permabroken And not through hundreds of hours of play Just getting your line stuck will do it Ooopshahahbeta And there goes your moneyit got mired in its punishing economy Play it if youre content with tossing out a float but expect to never see most of the XPlocked content
1,I LOVE IT  Awesome graphics  I used to spend a lot of time camping and  backpacking growing up  I broke my neck diving when I was 17 way way back in 183 and have been paralyzed since then  This is a close as I have found to being able to wander through the woods again314 hrs on recordAs a hunter in real lifeI respect this gamethe graphicsand how much fun it is Its not too easy or too hard to take down animalsso everyone can enjoy it I dont really have any complaints about the gamebesides a glitch here and there but thats not a big deal to me The only thing I would really like to see change is to have a trophy room added to the game It didnt really bother me much that there wasnt oneuntil yesterday when I harvested the legendary Red Deer in Hirschfelden I was a little dissapointed that I couldnt go back and look at how big it is So my idea is to have a trophy roomand either have it display the top 10 scoring animals a person has killedor have the hunter be able to select if they want a trophy in therewith a maximum of 20 trophies allowed I dont make the gameso this is just my idea of a small thing that would make the game more enjoyable for me Thanks for the fun this game has brought meDisclaimer  I dont recommend this game for people in hectic households toddler etc due to the lack of a pause functionor for people who are too busy to play for more than brief periods at a time  The gameplay involves long periods of stalking and waiting and is more suitable for those who can spare 12 hours of uninterrupted play time per sessiongiven the abundance of negative reviews reading some variation ofI ran around for hours and didnt see any animals010 I want to point out that this is a hunting simulator and not an action FPS  The game models noise and scent as well as visionand you are usually in pursuit of animals that have much better hearing andor senses of smell than humans  Running in the game is only suitable to get from point A to point B and should be avoided while actively hunting  Walking through bushes and tall grass should also be avoided on hunts although its not too noisy on trails  The animals will otherwise hear you coming and flee before you know they were thereand even if you spot their tracks youll never catch them just by running after thembut my player stats show that I have scared off via noise almost 00 animals  I have only seen 4050 so far  The animals are thereyou just arent going to stumble across them while running around as if it were Skyrim  The game requires long periods of slowly creeping around and sitting still in blinds or foliage using calls and peering through scopes or binocularsI bought this on sale just to see what it would be like  I was pleasantly surprised  The base game includes two large reserves maps to play on  They are beautiful and populated with sufficient species to keep the hunt interesting for tens of hours if not longerthe game makes good use of modern hardware and looks very pleasing  It isnt nextgen levelbut it looks great at 1080p with an RTX 200s  The animal models are perhaps the weak point hereas they could stand to be a little more detailed  Their animationhoweveris realistic and looks goodbut it functions as a series of challenges to complete in exchange for lump sums of experience and cash  You can ignore them and will probably complete them organically in time as you playor you can use them to get a feel for the gameplay and map layoutdiscovering landmarks and completing challenges  You get one skill point or one perk point per levelalternating  Skills vary from extremely useful make less sound when you walk  steadier aim to fun but unnecessary  Most players will therefore likely wind up building their hunter along similar lines  I feel that this is one area that could have been fleshed out a little morebut its acceptable asisso take that with a grain of salt  Unlike a game like Skyrimyou wont stumble across animals every 50 the moment you walk off a trail  You need to listen for their callsuse calls of your own to attract themfollow tracks and make use of need zones where animals congregate at certain times of the day to eatdrink or rest  By default the game uses visual helpers like glowing tracks and call indicators to help youbut you can turn those off if you want the realism and challenge  Note that this will invalidate some of the skill choices that adjust the indicatorsso youll want to build your hunter accordingly1015 minutes or longer at times depending on your prey and the conditions of the hunt  Going after elusive Diamondrated animals can allegedly take over an hour realtime for some people  If you enjoy stealth games and delayed gratification youll feel right at home  If you need constant action to stay immersedperhaps give the game a passI want to address the DLC elephant in the room  Yesthere are a lot of DLCand yes they add up if you buy them all at full price  Fortunatelythe DLC are completely optional  I bought the game on sale and picked up the wellreviewed Yukon and Tundra mapsand then later the Safari map mixed reviewsbut I want to experience an African map with one gun pack and one lodge for a total equal to a lunch  Not bad  After reading descriptions and reviews I decided I didnt need any of the other DLC  I say get the base game and maybe one map that really interests you and wait for a sale to grab anything else if you decide you like the game  Overall the maps cost as much as a coffee and donut on sale excepting the newest onewhich is a bit priciertense and dramatic at others  I wouldnt hurt a fly in real lifebut after experiencing long hunts in this game and bagging a goldrated deer or coyoteI think I understand better why reallife hunters enjoy hunting  If youre a real hunter I think youll enjoy the game even more than someone like me  Ive seen some positive reviews from actual huntersbut take a look for more if youre still on the fencehaving never played a hunting sim beforewhich is more than can be said for a lot of games Ive played  Considering what I paid for it on salean absolute bargainAt the age of 55I am new to the age of gaming I genuinely love the attention to detail in this game I also appreciate the fact that you can set your own pace for each session My most intense enjoyment of the game is with the multiplayer settingin whichI play with my adult sonwhile using the headset to communicate He laughs because I am a very emotional player There is only one feature I might change about this game While you are able to see the other playervia their name and location labeledit is unfortunate that each player cannot see the others way points Is there a way to incorporate this If so I would give it a score of perfection Very nice mapsbehave somewhat realistic most of the timecallibers dont really fit well with eachother performance wiseand the same for each weapon class although you only need to unlock them oncecookingeatingkeep playing and even seem to move with playerbut stillcan be really annoying canoes would be great in some maps like Layton and Yukonwould be interesting to track animals without the glowing but with dog 231120did not try them yet but they appear to be appreciatedwalk aroundmap need zones by following tracksdont expect to walk into animals when making a lot of noise Then when you have some interesting zonestry to ambush them at the right time especially drink zonesCuatro and Parque are a bit bland terrain wisejust a heightmap with vegetation However Vurhonga adds a lot of unique speciesand the openess kinda fits the theme Silver Peaks is nice but doesnt add a lot of new thingsMedved has also some overlap but has a really unique atmosphere Yukon also has some double species but the terrain is really epic and also features some dynamic weatherActually the game is good butyou have to pay more for the DLC I bought this game for 75 discbut wasting money more than the game on 1 DLC Of course you can play without DLCand also theres free DLCs toorestetcdont just walk around with noisy sound and blame the game cz u didnt get the animalsaccompany you all time at lonely place another maps why bcs u can hunt lionsloljust use ATV and all easyso Fking huge You can spent a day to walk around LOLanother map to hunt bearsyou will get impatient just remember when you dodont run at a bearStarted a massive argument with my girlfriend because I shushed her when I found a deer and thought she might scare it awayIts almost like real hunting  Its more like a simulation than a gameit blows 247  And itll be south one minute and then North 5 minutes laterruining your entire plan of attack   Generallyin real life in the Northern Hemispherewind blows west to eastwith small variance  Devs went full potato with the windcertain animals are smarter than others  Elk are dumb as hell in real life  But in this game theyre just as skittish as whitetail and rabbits which is just stupidcamouflage matters  Blending in with the environment matters  In this game it doesnt matter AT ALL  How you F this up when youre trying to create a hunting simulator is beyond meits a very fun gameGraphicsThe game is the most realistic hunting simulation game I have played The graphics are compatible with most modern laptops and desktopseven the low settings are pretty good Only wished the animals AI was more realistic For example in real lifeanimals will take the path of least resistance Same way we walk in worn down paths instead of overgrown grass right next to it Id like to see something like that implemented instead of the animals taking a generally straight path through bushes and what not Also the maps dont accurately define edges of water sources Other than those minor details its a great game 10 rating from meI POSTED A REVIEW YESTERDAYBUT IF YOURE LIKE MEYOULL LOVE IT  IM 5 CANT HUNT ANYMORE DUE TO A BAD  KNEE BACK BUT IN THIS GAMEI CAN BE A KID AGAIN WITH THE DLCSYOU CAN HUNT ON ANY

with the 270 rifle before it diedh1Where IRL meets fantasy gamingh1the outdoors experience in this open world sand box hunting sim is so like being in the great outdoors that most sessions I forget I’m gaming I often even forget the fact that I’m looking for achievements in the game Andfor a gamer who enjoys the thrill of capturing every single achieviethat’s a big deal It is the total world immersion that makes the experience of COTW so impressive I’ve only been playing for 3 weeksbut at the time of writing the review I have 0 of the achievements and almost 200 hours in game I am already the ‘Hero of Hirschfelden’ and ‘Lord of the Lakes’ because I’ve explored the total area of both maps Mumbles to self in monologueing voice “I like that Yes I like that very much” The missions are challenging enough that it will be awhile before I finish them all Sotime in game is almost unlimited I can’t see a stopping point yetsince the latest patch 1112 this works just fine Thanks EW for the frequent updates  for listening to the community needsbthat’s because I’ve often wished for a sim for climbing mountains Andthe challenge of discovering all the sights modeled after reallife geographical landforms archipelagobuttecanyongorgevolcanoand much moreis all very alluring Butmany natural points of interest are integrated into the mapsproviding a history or lore to these fictional maps that matches their reallife counterparts You are able to climb every mountain in the game You can explore totem memorials and abandoned ruins and collect artifacts The sound effects immerse you in the outdoor worldand the music is lovely Every area of the map is crafted with painstaking detail that provides eyecatching splendor to each sunrise and sunsetfor hunting and for photography with the cinematic camera in the controls The controls are all very simpleand can be keymapped for ease of use I like the run toggle so you don’t have to hold down W I changed the E use key to mouse 5so that when I’m tracking I can run toggle and use the mouse to navigate and click to read the tracks as I’m running The overlay provides mapping and a codex that stores all your accumulated knowledge of the world you’ve discoveredas well as those daytime hours Many outposts are scattered throughout the mapsand provide access to your storagethe ingame storeand a sleep point Sleeping allows you to move time ahead in hours Setting it to 1800 for examplewould make it sundown if you want to hunt at night Buteach time you sleep costs ingame moneymaking it a bit more of a challenge‘death’ only resets your character at a sleep point  you lose nothing Atvs are unlimited Abandoning one at the foot of a mountain is nothing You can retrieve it at the next outpostor even pitch a tentand summon one up Tents have a limit that seems to be about 7 or so on each reserve With fast travelyou are able to move from tent to tent if you wanted to be in another location to hunt at dark I like to explore in the daytimeand hunt at sunsetsunriseand nighttimewhether for hunting or photography Multiple arcs of missions are imbedded in the single player to allow the option of structured gameplayfor those who want more than just simple run and gun type game play Of courseeven the most hobbitlike adventurers like mewho love to wander around the countryside seeing all the sites and animalslove to find a cozy spot on a rock overlooking a canyon and accumulate a few carcasses down below before climbing down to harvest them allmore is always betterwhen it comes to weapons in game More would be even better It also has luresammoand other gear for hunting Scattered around the countryside are woodpiles for building permanent ground blinds using ingame currency These provide more experience points for the skills  perk trees as well The skill  perk trees provide a good range of skills to work toward increased hunting experience for the current 0 max of levels These add abilities such as gauging the weatherand improved tracking skillsbut it looks as if these can be purchased eventually with ingame funds as an alternativethough it would take a lot of time Either way4 bucks is the cheapest expansion dlc I’ve seen Andthe ATVs are an awesome part of the hunting and exploration Andthe tents allow portable base access functioning like the permanent outposts throughout the maps PersonallyI’d love to see the addition of boats and fishing Butthat is just a wishlist item I see no cons to this gameCall of the Wild by Jack London Like the bookthe game reveals much about the lives and behaviors of animalsand the great outdoors Many species are integrated into the world of the current two reserves in Germany and America Black BearsRoosevelt ElksRed FoxesCoyotesEuropean BisonWild BoarMooseRed DeerFallow DeerRoe DeerWhitetail Deerand Blacktail Deer Besides the typical colorsseveral rare  albino furs appear randomly The upcoming dlc expansion will add a third reserve in Siberia Medvedwith snow and an anticipated new selection of animals such as the already revealed Lynxand later an Explorer’s Post as a young adult I’ve enjoyed the fun of group campouts with my sons in the cub scouts over the course of a decade  the numerous camping trips with families  friends over the yearsand even group  solitary hiking  camping experiences ButI’ve never been hunting myself As great of an experience as solitary hiking  camping can befriendship is a huge part of the outdoors COTW provides a smooth multiplayer experiencewhere you can either create your own server gameor jump in with already created servers All outposts  locations unlocked in singleplayer are also available for quick travel on the multiplayer maps You can join your buddies for group cooperative hunts or compete in challengeswhich is really nice while sitting in a hunting stand in the dark waiting on the animal herd to arrivefans of shootersopen sandboxand sims The devs at Expansive Worlds have made a high quality game for everyone to loveI grab gunI see deerI missI recommendOverall its a great hunting game The base game is good enough on its own to give you an enjoyable experience hunting several varieties of animalsTents and ATVs are also DLC items that i feel should have been included in the base gameand I have bought thembut they really do impact your play in a meaningful way so it is hard not feel like they were left out on purposeaverage bucksand monster bucks Weight and coloration plays a part in this too In short every animal has a trophy of some kind and they are varied by what must be some sort of RNGthis game can devolve into a shooting gallery were you kill everything on sight as there in no real incentive not to You get money and experience for every kill you claim and wiping out a heard of deer with your DLC M1 Garand on your DLC Tripod Stand becomes the quickest way to bypass the grindthis is a game i would recommendbut it is just thata gameThe Hunter COTW is an amazing game for those who have the patience for it It takes alot of practice and knowledge to learn the game and its mechanics At first glance the game might seem very slow pace and boring and i dont blame anyone for thinking that once you purchase the game you will be able to play two diffirent maps Layton Lake and Hirschfelden These maps have a total of 1 diffirent animalsspecies for you to hunt All the diffirent animals are split into diffirent weapon classes from 1  So diffirent animals require a diffirent caliber for exampel a Whitetail deer is a weapon class 4 There are five diffirent ranks for all the animals bronze silver gold diamond and The Great One only applies to some species You start from level 1 and progress ur way up to 0 As you level up you will unlock diffirent perks and skills to help you hunt animals more efficient You will also unlock new equipment such as weapons animal callers and binocularsSo Ill start off by saying that this game is tons of fun I really enjoy the thrill of getting a good shot off on your targeted game and the reports that judge you on how ethical your kill was I love all of the aspects to this game that attempts to get close to a real hunt What i dont like is the paywall to access features that shouldin my opinionbe included in a hunting simulator Having to buy DLC to have access to more weaponstentsATVmore reservesmore speciesand hunting resorts really makes me not want to play it past the hours i already have in Well over 70 of this game seems to be hidden behind a paywall I broke down and bough the ATV DLC because its absurd to sink 1020 minutes in walking multiple km to discover fast travel points or arrive at favored hunting spots I just cant bring myself to pay for the rest of the game  of your time you spend walking around the forestfireing your gun and missing all the significant organs of the animals
1,Great coop survival game The idea behind it is fun and a great throwback to Honey I Shrunk the Kids Exploring is so much fun with someoneuse the arachnophobia mode It turns the spiders into cute bubbles to fight The actual spiders are very well animated and are legit scary even to a nonarachnophobe like meA game that plays very similarly to the forestexcept instead of cannibalsthere are horrific giant spiders that i hate very very very very very very very very very muchWhen I first bought this gameI came into it with fairly low expectations I figured7 Days to Die meets Honey I Shrunk the Kidssurewhy not and I eagerly punched my ticket on the train to capture a little childhood nostalgia What I got was SO much betterand flatout impressive for a game that still purports to be on Version 3 in an environment where that actually MEANS something sorry 7DTDI love youbut 3 years of alpha is sillyjust to get it out of the wayit claims that I have 3 hours play timebut I really only have 45 minutes or so in It only acknowledges the shut down when I completely exit and restart the steam client So if youre evaluating it against the  hour return clockbe VERY aware of thisyou do need XBox Live for multiplayer I dont know if that means you need a paid subscription or not  I happen to be on the 3 month free pass for Discord Nitro If it does that would be a SERIOUS problemas multiplayer is where this games value mostly resides for methe characters are fully voice acted with unique and endearing personalitiesso I understand thats a HUGE askbut its my hope that theyll get it up to like 68 minimum 1 ideally before coming to full release It would be particularly cool if each kid had unique advantagesdisadvantages in approaching puzzles and crafting think oldschool Maniac Mansionfor those of you familiar with that gamethe characters have no idea howwhy theyve been miniaturizedand finding out seems to be the main plot VERY coolso there may come a time when this particular map gets boringpredictableand hopefully theyll add procedurally generated ones in the future But what a delight It feels very wide open and three dimensionallots of underground tunnels and omnidirectional exploration potentialand the ants will mess you up if you venture into the wrong area before youre ready I love the challengedelightful art style  Maybe its being a 7DTD veteran that makes this stand outbut the cartoonishvibrant and sunny backyard is such a welcome change from the drab motif of the apocalypse they really captured the idea of how scale changes the look and feel of otherwise familiar objects and surroundings They took it way beyond its conceptual roots into new and awesome placesand Im glad I supported it while in early access I hope the team is responsive to tweak and change requestsbecause this already good game has the potential to be truly amazingI love this game I originally bought it for my dad for a birthday present I wanted to play it tooso I got it for myself too Then after playing multiplayer with my dadmy niece and nephew saw the game and spent their hard earned money because they wanted to play so badand its loads of fun Its easy enough for kids to playand its complex and challenging enough for adults to enjoy Its rare to find a game this funand big It builds our relationships even while playing the gamewhich is a huge plus for me Updates are coming out faster than we can explore the mapand the map is huge We love itGreat fun so far with friendsplayed smoothly with 3 other people on xbox 1 on pc and had no issues until it crashed and now were having trouble getting back in together Despite this it seems like a fantastic coop game and people are over reacting as usual in the reviewsme and my friends had a good 5 hour session with no issues Base buildingfighting bugsexploring etc Seems like a great little game so far and very excited to keep finding new thingswhich did surprise usthere is still plenty to discoverlong after you get to the current story end and you can really tell how good the story will be once more has been addedWhen I was a kid I wanted to be able to shrink downthanks to this game I dont wanna anymoreWhile the Story is rather shorttheres still quests and building to do YESyou need an Xbox Live Account but PC Players DO NOT have to pay to playYou literally log in once and it remembers you the next time aroundno annoying window prompts or anything People are review bombing because they lack common sense Its an EARLY ACCESS gamejust because you beat it in mins or something doesnt mean thats all theres gonna beyoure buying the game to support the devs and developmentHeybut at least you get to kill them If you grew up wondering what it would be like to be the Szalinski childrenwell nows your chance  Sure it may not be your lovable Canadian father who made you 1 inch tallbut the outcome is the same  Dodge spiders and stink bugs as you try to scratch out a corner of your very own in this gorgeous survival game  It is made by obsidianso I expect a lotand have been Exactly pleased with their offeringgame good i love to play with my dadIf you ever wanted Honey Ive Shrunk the Kids in real life as a kidthis is your game Fulfilling one of my childhood dreamsI forgot i hadSo Grounded is amazing and terrifying at the same time Game needs some difficulty adjustmentbut its cool to see a new environment ive never seen in video gamesbut there are way to many of them especially given that they can one shot you and they are super buggy I also find that even if you dont engage themthey passively walk slowly towards your position for quite some time and for some distance Spiders need an overhaul ASAPbut nothing didbut I will wait Just get rid of the XBOX live garbage and let us connect via steamHoney I Shrunk The Kids finally made into a videogame It was going to happen at some point rightList of fun things in this gamefun game  I really cant wait to see what they do with the gameReeeeeaaaaallly awesome Got this game close to when it came out for me and my son to play Loved the whole honey I shrunk the kids theme I will admit I was worried at first because we kept dying early in the game darn soldier ants But as you learn the mechanics of the game and how the bugs actit becomes much easier and enjoyable to play Definitely a sandbox gamecollect itemsidentify recipescraft whatever you can wherever you want almost Weve already set up several bases on the map It does have a bit of a story that is still evolving via updates Burgl name the bot is awesome Controlsanimationand collision detection is really smooth Has some intense moments in the game and some cool bug battles We are still waiting for a Scorpion updatethat would be insane Bug pets to ride andor fly on would be good too Keep up the good workGraphicsI would rate this game at its current state in early access around a 751but as its early access there are a few very noticeable bugs and kinks in the game that need to be worked outthe crafting aspects in this game are plentiful and NOT repetitive feeling as there is a lot to do with the resources in the game I had a lot of fun crafting things For the baseI could also put up blueprint plans as well as for the CookingBedsetc and my boyfriend could help me build them So it allowed for teamwork in the aspect of I set up the peremiters and plans and we both harvested resources and delivered them into the spots I planned It was a lot of funand let me know that we both were taking part to build and set up everything unlike a lot of other crafters where I usually am doing solobasebuilding and my boyfriend is doing a more redudant job of harvesting and storing the resources so I can This aspect made us both feel more equally involvedthe ability to climb unless somehow I didnt ever unlock it seems neccessary to a point in this worldin my personal opinion This is where my reduction of points comes fromhowever Otherwise if notstill wonderful At times it feels like Im in a Cyber weird science movie or Labhowwhy they were shrunkand who caused this and how you connect to it For most of the gameplay me and my boyfriend were definitely trying to figure out why these things and unlock tapes scattered through out the world I do think there could be more guided gameplay of the story  however for early access thus far the story progress despite only getting what I feel like was 11 chunks of the story was still satisfying and leads me to want to play moreI SHRUNK THE KIDSmy computer despite being custom built is much older and still operates on Windows 7 OSmy boyfriend experienced a few more bugs that made his game play quite a hindranceat times causing him to lose many things in his inventoryI had no issues fully navigating through the gameI also expierenced the Wolf Spider in the Oak tree not attacking which leads me to believe the spider spawn in that area is bustedthe bugs are understandable and didntfor the most partcause any real damage to playing the game as the game is still forgiving in respawning pretty much what seems to be endless resources but with a difficulty curve even on Medium level not seem so awfuland you can certainly in a way Parkour but I dropped into a part of the map that did not allow me whatsoever the ability to climb out and didnt seem like it was meant for someone to drop into Leaving me to have to manually Give Up which allows you to essentially seppuku so you can respawn and start overas far as the Steam version goes as I cant speak of the XBox Market Platform itself as I dont own the game thereyou do NOT have to be an active paying Xbox Live GOLDULTIMATE subscriber to play with your friends I wanted to make this clear as NO REVIEWS NOR ONLINE GOOGLE SEARCHES had originally answered this question that people have been asking Whether this changes in the future or notI dont know  but currently at the time of me writing this review you do NOTget more recipesother unlocksetcthat works similarly to the way you find more of the outdoor science HUD tents Finding both of these things is cumbersome as their lacks to be a minimapand your scanneralerterthingy is realllllllly REALLY wonky in helping direct you to either of these things especially pure raw science clusters that are harder to see and more hidden I feel like the scanner needs to be made radialdirectional because thus far in an open world the only indicator is a flash and a beep from the HUD spoilerEveryone used to have this type of imagination when we were kidsyou have to admit that I know its just a game and still have a lot of bugs but I feel like a part of my imagination came true D you know that feeling There are still a lot of things they can put into the game that I am really looking forward to seeing  Anywayits fun thats all it takesProbably going to draw quite a bit of flak for this not recommended review but hear me outas it would be in a bugs life in this case yoursin their size The lack of handholding pushes the player to think on their feetwhich fits well into the mystery of this situation you are thrown into unnecessary handholding wouldve taken away from immersion otherwiseor a decently fleshed out story with a promise of an eventual sandbox In groundedwe have little of either The story comes to a very quick end as it is still being created perfectly understandable Howeverthere is not much content in the sandbox department as the ceiling of craftables are quite quickly reached which the exception of tier  tools With a very familiar and simple trope of only having to manage hunger and thirstthere is little to do in the sandbox other than basic base building Most survival games so far even on early access release have had decent enough distractions for your character to manage ColdThirstHungerFatigue in The Long Dark or endless base building possibilities Minecraftand theres much more to come I agreeand I would expect no less from a dedicated dev like Obsidian Howeverthis release shouldve been eitherat half its pricemy not recommended review is specifically on a cost benefit analysis of getting this game in its current state at this price My position will change knowing Obsidianhighly likely for the better based on price of the game after some of its more larger content updates are releasedThis game is alot of funthe concept of surviving in your backyard as a shrunk down person is very interesting to work with However the game does have drawbacksfirst the inventory management is clunky and sometimes doesnt work as intendedundoing my attempts of sorting my inventory by rejoining is common Secondly some of the enemies are too powerful to take on in single playerleading to frustrtionyou would have already been killed  times by random spiders and mosquitoes before you are even able to fight them off because of our lack luster gear Lastly is the water physicstrying to get out of water onto a lily pad feels like rubbing yourself against sandpaper due to the height gained by jumping out of water being tiny But all of these can be solved in a patchupdate in the future so let me move onto the good parts The creativity is astounding in this world that the team of Grounded has createdthere isnt a second of this game that i truly felt bored because there is so much to do and explore The designs of the creatures are incrediblenot often i would say that ants are cuteand likewise the spiders are scary and fierce comparable to a Trex in your backyard This game can create beautiful landscapes if you stop to take in the beauty in front of you
1,When I was originally deployedI spent my first day gathering scrap in Meta for our brothers fighting down South Spent three hoursnonstop just gathering scrap and materialsgiving it to people who would deliver it to the battlefronta truck pulled up to my scrap heap Telling me that men were needed on the front lineI loaded into the truck with a gun and rode to the battlefront It was a three minute rideso the boys and I were talking amongst ourselves It was all our first time going into combatwe were excited to see it first handenemies were advancing over the bridge and we were being mowed down like flies I had a medic kit and was doing my best to keep people alivebut you cant save everyone Mortars were blasting our positionand after fortyfive minutes I thought we were going to be overrun Just as this thought crosses my minda halftrack blows past me with the gunner screaming for men to follow the vehiclefurther than we had been all morning The half track kept pushingbut was blown to hell after an RPG hit it The enemies ended up blowing the bridge behind my squadthere were ten of us We had to hold the line until that was rebuiltwhich would allow for reinforcements to let us make it across the rest of the bridgefriends Id grown attached to during this hours long battle I was on a machine gunand I fired and fired and fired at any enemies I could see Screaming at them The four of usheld the line for fifteen whole minutes before reinforcements arrived Once they didwe were able to take the bridge and advance onto the Jade Covewhere every action you make matters to the warbuy this right away This is the best purchase Ive made in a whileThis is a complicated beast of a game Reading through the reviews around this oneIve noticed some common trends The positive ones either see something truly remarkable about this games conceptor they talk about a specific positive experience they had with it The negative reviews complain about glitches or are from veterans who have lost faith that the game will ever be what it was promised While valuableI dont think any of these have the full picture Then againthe game is too big to be summarized in a few paragraphs I shall try regardlessbut Im more interested in sharing the unique experience this game offersevery rifle carriedevery tank destroyed was at one point built by a playerbut not always used by the same player Thats an important distinctionbecause logistic chains are the name of the game Battles are won as much by attrition or one side running out of bullets as brilliant strategic maneuvers it falls to logistics players to organize and adapt to ensure their side does not suffer that fate All levels of combat in this game come back to logistics somehow Partisans intercept shipments behind enemy lines to try and starve the enemy front line An artillery crew can be devastatingbut shells are expensive and someone needs to supply them As soldiers die and respawn they need more supplies to keep fightingbut medical supplies can extend the effective lifespan of soldiers and prevent equipment loss Defenses are invaluable but take time and resources to buildand usually have blind spotsso they need to be placed in appropriate locations Everything comes back to scarcity and how it is handled by logistics Additionallyno one is ever mechanically forced to do a specific job There is no medic classthere is no tanker class Every job is done because for whatever reason a player or players have taken it upon themselves to ensure it happensthats because it is Its hard for me to imagine a game that comes with as much stuff to learn as this one Hundreds of hours in Im still learning things Even something as basic as what is the objective can be a difficult thing to ascertainbecause its dependent on what your team wants to do But its also hard to imagine a more supportive community There are literally hundreds of veterans who share a love for this game and want to share it with others If you are lost and confusedand ask for helpsomeone will provide Some veterans make it their business to  train new playersand set up training squads and platoons to get new guys into the war faster and with a better idea of what to do  Unfortunately not everyone is as kindand there is some elitism in the community But ultimately most are good people and Ive never struggled to find dedicated team players in this game Additionallyits difficult to imagine a more diverse community Its not uncommon to find a half dozen nationalities represented in a single squadso Ill rap this up with a story Several months agoafter a major update there was a sale With the salecame a flood of new and inexperienced players The spawn area was packed with confused newbies and no one was sure what to do with them A few veterans gathered them upand came up with about twenty soldiers Twenty raw recruits with no idea how this game workedand were eager to shoot something The veterans ran these troops through the tutorialhammering what bits of wisdom they could into them Newly trained in the basicsthey headed to the backlinesand gathered up a number of halftracks and trucks for their use In an organized columnthis group of five veterans and twenty new soldiers drove down to the front linehearing the occasional Go get ems and Holy the army is heres from the impressed veterans they passed Other new players and some veterans who had jumped in without direction joined them as they wentswelling their numbers further When they got to the front linethe town of Kingstonethey found that the front had stalled Their halftracks werent well equipped to push the line forwardand taking these new players into the meat grinder would be a disaster So they went east insteadand attacked a neighboring town These recruits crashed through the weak defenses and began clearing the town house by house But disaster struck A line of Colonial tanks arrived and destroyed every halftrackand the artillery piece they had brought along Undeterredthe units commander told everyone to grab an RPG and walk back to the town Twentysomething men with rocket launchers can do a lot of damage The town was capturedand the unit secured the place as best they could Enemy tanks attacked relentlesslybeing destroyed or repelled with each wave The unit eventually disbanded as players got tired and logged offbut the town was oursand they had been seen A pressconsultant for the community news cast saw all of thisand wrote a story for the next stream Foxhole Flasha twitch stream in the style of a WW radio showran a piece on this attack on the town guarded by new recruits where tanks came to die The accomplishments of that group of newly blooded soldiers were immortalizedand it was all made possible because a few players took commandand the rest were willing to follow themand I shall hold it dear to my heart for years to come This game is challenging to get into It can be frustrating and its still in early access There are glitchesimbalancesand sometimes you just might not have a good day online But the fact that stories like that are written with every warin every battleis enough for me to recommend this game I hope this was helpfuland  hope to see you on the frontI played roughly 1 hours in three weeks after purchasing it The game is really absorbing and likely the best earlyaccess game ive ever seeni spend more time on the menu than the game itself The communityonce goodturned into a mess of selfentitled children belonging to one or more of the massive clanswhich ran this game into the groundservers usually look likeand suddenly some blob clan enters the gameturns it into a 6vcompletely destroying any fun in the gamethen hop onto the next serverrepeat They are very well known to use exploits in order to be unkillablegain more precise shotsgrief with the enemy supplies  via joining the opposite teamor other unjust advantageswhich obviously causes the main clan players to never be banned no matter what they doas a moderator will vouch for themwhich isnt badbut not as important as solving gamebreaking issuesi can see this game being played by less than a hundred playerswith most of the servers ending up like 3vspeople getting bored and leavingthere was massive backlash from the community for posting thisbeing even more toxic Mods literally telling me to kill myself DO NOT get this game at allthis exploded Glad to see so many people listening to my counsel In all honestyi must admit i also got certainly fired up during that last talk with the moderatorsbut that was due to them getting me kickedbanned without proof as some sort of revenge against my personwhereas in the other hand youd expect mods to be professional at all timesexplaining stuff rather than going no u It reallyreally saddens me to see such a promising game being ruined by the aforementioned issues Will maybe check it again in a few monthsif its not dead by thenand will let you knowi tried to go back to the game and see how its developingwith several different people so this Mod Abuse isnt just to my person but to many others Alsoexample of how the servers are horrifyingly unbalancedi talked personally to one devand managed to calmly expose the issues the game hasthe reason that led me to this reviewand gave him a few tips about what id personally do to drive the game forward  Ill keep you informed in the coming daysbut some OK Got into two servers  In onefull of toxic players wishing cancer to each other Fleed immediately to another which was balanced and had a great time with a group of players Faith restored Not so muchi saw something absurdexcept now abusing his new modpowersthe exploiter clan i talked about before The othera complete random They start teamkilling each other bannable offense and the 8dk player starts insulting pretty much everyone on the channel This corrupt mod jumps in and bans the other playerand does not even warn the 8DK about this kind of behaviourbut im not against namingandcalling such people from now onyou can have fun with some people but the community is just as toxic as it can getmod corruption runs rampant and devs do nothing to stop italmost three years laterim glad this review helped the many thousands of people who commentlikeor even directly message me about it Sorry that i no longer answer people here I just dont feel the need toas i have put the game aside since two years ago Im aware some things have changedwhile many others remain the same At this pointi will simply leave the review here as proof of what happened throughout the games development timelineand i encourage you to read the comments and make your own decisionso please refrain from insulting comments from now on ThanksMy first experience on Foxholeand together pushed pretty farmy tank comrades left the tankreal warriors never leave their tankthey die with itthe enemies didnt destroy my tanka guy came and said Its okay buddywe came to rescue youi quickly switched to the driver position and drove the fuck awayhave spent all 7 hours defending one bridgeSoI have played under 4 hours of this gameits 1 worth itapparently its a server dedicated to helping new players learn the gameExperienced players were literally rounding up players as they spawned inputting them in a squadand then step by stepshowing them how to play the gamevehiclesgunsbuildingmedical and then told us we were ready to go to waror we could stay and learn about the rest of the game  i opted for the latteri felt like i was ready for warsalt something and was instantly told by a player to get downas soon as i crouched the player that told me to get down had his head shot off and all i had was a pistoli gracefully looted my fallen saviorand followed the emerging allied troops as we moved up the road to the norththey had MG nestssandbagstrenchestanksplacing our own trenches and defensesand began to push them back towards something called the pit which they had made a fort out of at the top of the roadbut we held fastour medics were going nuts running from one injured person to the nextrandom craters were formed by the dropping bombswhich was our only cover and gunfire was everywherei got my first couple kills in this encounterand looted a submachine gun from a fallen enemyi had plenty of ammo that i looted off of him and saw that the enemys right flank their left was completely openi pointed this out to the guys in my craterabout 5 of usand we made a mad dash for the flankwe noticed several supply trucks coming in3 of us split off and threw grenades onto the truckswhile me and we will call him Jimmy stayed and coveredas soon as the trucks blew upthe enemy was upon us like flies on blowing up the first wave of enemys but it was far from over3 tried to rush into our little crater and i shot them down with my submachine gunbut jimmy only had a rifle and wasnt able to keep up with the demand for firethe next wave almost overwhelmed us as they started using cover and gained fire superioritypinned down and unable to do muchjimmy and I began to attempt an escapebut i was shot and was too injured to go much furtherand attempted to fend them offbut i convinced him to leave me behindmust have taken several of those Bs with me before they got meour little distraction and Jimmys survival caused the enemy to overextend on that flankletting us wipe them out and force the line back at almost a sprintand i had so much fun i cannot wait to play tomorrowWas yelled and cussed at by a 11 year old for not delivering the items he requested while running logisticssome people called me crazy for farming scraps for hoursin one of our Scrap yards But they did not expectto keep gettin tons of supplies Every time they saw me still mining the scrapthey try to tell me to stop miningbut i always said we can never get enough of scrapand more scraps to the logistic Then suddenly some from the logistic squadtold me to follow them in one of they trucks They showed me what they have build from the scrapsthat i have delivered to them They showed me a base full of foxe holesPilboxesand many more They said to mebecause of you we could make this outpostbecause of you we could keep pushing the enemieswith out worrying about suppliesabout a crazy guy in the scrap yard They called it the Reds Scrap yardwhile they even added a order that shows where it wasit was not much but soon most of my team knew who i was They keep visitingme Commending I told them not do iti just did this to help our teamone of them said in chat Not all heroes wear capes But i said to himnot all heroes are sane because i mined in that spot for almost 8 hoursIf you want to be b the b soldier you may have troubles to truly enjoy the gamei bought this game with high hopes I started playing and was a bit disappointed with the above angle I went to the front and players were mostly taking pop shots from a distance I was not sure what to make of itthen it happenedwho had just noticed me I fired and missedhe fled My sergeant was mortally wounded and fell to the ground He said to me you fought well soldierthis time I felt it though The gears of the war machine turning around me I hopped on a truck to the front lines The driver wished us luck as he dropped us off under distant gun fireparticipated in several raids Received several commendations from my comrades Made friendslost friendsFelt hopelessfelt powerfulyou name it 11Do you like working mostly alone Do you like Timers Do you like grinding in the middle of nowhere for hardtoget resources Then Logi is for youpraying that the enemy wont land a piercing shell on your sorry asses Then Armour is for youFirst night playing this game I spent the entire time fighting for control of a bridgeI told him if I died to tell me wife she was a whehe replied with Oh I know she isThe End Times are herethis seems to be the most stand out difference from other gamesboth combat and logistics are required to succeed Being a PvE player myself didnt mean I never saw combat Delivering needed supplies to the front IS a dangerous endevor as a few pistol shots can disable a supply truckforcing you out into the thick of itbut to continue the bloodlust Fine by meas I couldnt have been in better handsthe end times are hereand I couldnt be happierthis game does include that same feeling of ownership but in a different way Instead of the player character being the starits the map All you do is reflected in the maps status so once a war is wonits a bit like a server resetSimply putthis is the greatest MMO I have ever playedI dismissed the idea that players actually worked together I could not believe that a developer team could create a game where it takes a minimum of 3 people to fire just one artillery gun Yet not only have they managed to do thisbut the mechanics are set up to make this fun I have seen more teamwork in just one game than I have seen in all other MMOs combinedthere are many vets willing to patiently teach newbies the ropesthis MMO alone has a real player driven mission to win the war Every minute of every daythere are battles raging across every hex Each battlelarge or smallis genuinely important Whether it is a titanic tank battle for control of a city or a single partisan sabotaging logistics deep behind enemy lineseach person is engaged in what feels more like a real struggle than any other game I have ever played The nature of the playerdriven war makes the game into an environment for a thousand sidequests culminating in the thrill and relief of finally winning a war that has lasted potentially weeks There is the thrill of driving the enemy back and capturing a town There is the comradery when you and a few people are under siegestruggling trying to hold ground against a horde of enemy tanks There is the relief of seeing a player deliver desperately needed supplies after you have used your last clip of 76mm There are genuine ups and downs that feel real because the people who make it possible are you and your comrades in arms You can shape events which affect the outcome of a war driven by hundreds of other playersyou can be an insurgent working deep behind enemy lines or a logistics trucker delivering supplies to an embattled frontfirst you hear the scream of enemy shells and the blast as they hit the city You hear the return fire from friendly howitzers blasting away Players are rushing around building defenses or unloading flak guns from trucks You hear a tank commander issuing orders to his crew as you pass You hear a man calling out coordinates for his artillery crew Then you hear the machinegun fire in the distancejust ahead of you Then the small arms fire and you realize that the front has pushed towards the very base you are trying to resupply When you deliver the cratesthe players praise you for delivering what was so desperately needed You hear genuine relief from real people from every country and you even feel a sense of pride in your ingame countryAs a gamerI rather dislike MMOs Theyre usually massive timesinks where you have to rely on grinding your way through tasks for your own personal benefit If you dont put in the timethen you suffer from being left behind or make little to no personal progress Foxhole is different Even if you spend just an hour or  in gameyou can contribute to the greater good for the entire team Just that small amount of time can make a huge impactand help change the course of a battleI was watching a streamer on Twitch play the game for many hours The team was struggling to make a breakthrough into a town and the side was getting pretty darn frustrated Resources were not coming in fast enough to the outpost and everything was at a stalemateand as Id seen from the Streamthe place was chaos A tank squad were screaming for tank shells The resources were coming inbut noone was assembling these shells for use I knew what I had to do So I started assembling shellafter shellafter shell whilst the tank squad were out fighting with what they personally could gather to prevent the enemy pushing us back Upon their next return they were shocked to find over 4 shells and a tonne of fuel I had personally assembled waiting for them They commended me for my efforts and were quickly back on the frontlineour side had made a breakthrough The key to breaking the stalemate was the Tank Squad who had the resources to finally smash through the towndestroy defenses and allow the teams infantry to clear out the enemy The tank squad and the whole side attributed this monumental victory in the war to my efforts I was quickly given commendation after commendation which poured in from the higher ranked players on the serverdropping weapons and ammo to the frontline was met with Hey SaracenFantastic job Saracen followed by Hey youre Saracenyoure the same guy from Twitch chat I saw what you done dudeawesome workand change the course of the war againIf you dontpretending that you actually got fucking injuredThis game is built around the peopleus logi guys with a whole squad of normal soldiers pick up a rifle and chase the attackers into the forest Firefight after firefight we pushed on but each time losing one from the logi groupfightingA week ago I was diagnosed with a terminal illnes and the doctors have given me a year at best Im so glad I was able to play this masterpiece before I go I dont know how many people will see this but I recomend to you to buy this game if you do see it Gameplaygraphicsrealismeffects everything is masterfully crafted Thank you Clapfoot Studios for your gameTLDRand I’ve never been successful FurthermoreI don’t expect to return to the game Read on for an explanationget gunshootlootdierepeat I had a blast trying out all the weapons and loadoutswhich means if you want to be effectiveyou’ll be staring the very corner of your monitor for long stretches of timetrying to parse out the enemies under your UI For this reasonif I’m feeling a topdown shooterI’ll play something elsebut the experience is cut short when something frustrating happens Maybe the respawns run out and your friend can’t easily get back to the front Maybe there aren’t enough public supplies at the front to keep your friend’s interest Maybe he gets pinned in the spawn by a friendly truck or soldiers Maybe he does something incredibly stupid out of ignorance and gets flamed by a veteran player I’ve been on both sides of this A person who isn’t in the mood to grind past all these things will not last longI decided to try logistics Even though it has a learning curveit’s rewarding to see a wellplanned delivery make an impact on the frontyou click the item and a timer begins When the timer expiresyou get the thing Big things take more time so sometimes you’ll click a thing you need and wait a solid minute for it to appear in your inventory No minigamejust waitingoften for minutesnot seconds You can’t move or interact when this is happeningbut you can think about what else you could be playingyou can start planning operations I’ve had some incredible adventures Once a Scotsmanan Australianand myself an American stole an enemy ocean freighter full of supplies and gloriously sailed off into the sunset while the enemy watched helplessly from the shore Epicthe fundamental problem with operations is that your teammates all have different goalsor simply no goals at alland this can lead to hours of planning being ruined in a matter of secondsthen use vector addition to calculate ranges from all howitzer positions NextI would need shells I couldn’t find some poor chump to grind them for meso I expected to spend 4 hours getting them thereand I have 4ish shells in my howitzerall enemy positions mapped outinformation support from the front It’s been a long roadbut I’m so readyand so are the soldiers ready to push with support from the back I go back to grab the last load from the forward basebut when I return a curious private is occupying the howitzer next to his corporal buddy who is making a futile attempt to spot targets 1 meters downrange with binoculars that can see 8 meters Frustrated at not being able to map any targetsthe private fires 3 shells randomly downrangecompletely missing all but a few friendly structures I plead them to let me on the howitzer so the operation can beginbut the private’s response is to continue to fire shells After  shellsI admittedly get perturbedpull a pistoland take the private down His buddy executes me in response I respawn to what seemed be an admin or mod telling me that I need to let other people have a turnand that team killing will result in a ban In silenceI watch the private fire the remaining  shells randomly He exits the howitzerand the pair head towards the front I close the gameI have a lot of play time because the systems are very grindy and take a long time to understand Much of that play time is passive where I walked away from the computer because waiting is such a massive part of the game I had some fun times with some folks and loved learning how everything worked Howeverthe memorable adventures are diamonds in sea of coaland once I came to an understanding of each part of the gameI feel that other games deliver what this game attempts to offer in a far more efficient and less frustrating wayIve driven many miles hauling supplies to the front Ive spent countless hours hunched in the drivers seat of a tankwaiting to be graced by the light of day and the order to drive forth and push the enemy back Ive watched from the trenches as a dozen men are slaughtered by a well placed artillery blastand Id do it all again
1,If you liked Age of Empires III gameplayyoull like this Fair warningyou are basically paying for a slightly better looking AoE with two new civs Now mind youif this was any other game youd probably be ok paying 15 for two new factionsor rather you wouldnt be ok with it but you would do it anyway Consider thatand consider that you also get a discount on this if you own Age IIIand who understands the current political climateI understand and support why you changed the names of the Sioux and Iroquois to their preferred name That doesnt bother me in the slightestand it really has only positives for people of those backgrounds and cultures to support their representation HoweverI find it problematic that you are attempting to erase the word ColonyColonial from a game that is about the whole colonial system You guys felt the need to apologize for creating this game in a climate that generally had no issue with these wordsand you changed them to appeal to changing political climates What you fail to understandis that at least your campaign does a good job of explaining the brutal and unjust nature of imperialism and colonialism The whole India campaign is an amazing scorch of British imperialismas the Warchief section is a scathing and honest representation of US imperialismall youre doing is attempting to conceal history Terminology matters when discussing historychanging terms makes no sense In the academic communitywe dont alter colonialism from our terminologyratherwe acknowledge it for what it iswas and write or study it Alsobe mindful this game greatly exaggerates all societies and communitiesand while some portrayals can be considered unsavory in our 2020 worldjust note that the European communities represented are also stereotypes Why is this important Because its a VIDEO GAMEBrings back the good old times when my only worry was doing the homework for the next days classesThe gameplay is great but the issues with the game are so bad it makes me doubt I will even buy the next one in the series I also wish i knew the issues before i played the game now knowing the risksi can see why they did it but its super shady and makes me have 0 trust in the gamein generalis fairly demanding  Tried using my work pc where i have to run multiple emulators for perf tests and even that pc had issues with frame drops every so often on max settings and ran into an occasion where all 2 gigs were used on the gamean example is if people change their colors and you pick the free one it might still say its takeni think this one had great potential but with the issuesi think it wont hit that potential anytime soon or at allsoftware developers failed in producing optimal code or didnt have enough time to profile the game to check for performance issues and refactor Management failed to see the potential and didnt try their own product before release and possibly didnt listen to their team to extend the deadline being afraid to make the decision to talk to their publisherAs someone whos played the original AOE III for many yearsIncluding both AOE I and AOE II and their respective DE releasesI have to say that this game is beyond absurdI absolutely cannot comprehend their though process when they decided to remake it Age of Empires III was already the black sheep of the AOE series for many reasons and unique flawsbut it still managed to be one of my favourite during the years They made many great changes but then took ten steps Sowhat did they screw up in this amazing releasethey also changed the Lakota Sioux Campaign with Chayton Black to make it more in line with Lakota culturewhich I can completely understand But they also removed Crazy Horse from itone of the reasons blatantly beingand I kid you notYou should ask his descendants if thats okay with them Surelet me ask Stalins last descendant if its completely okay to make a WW2 game that includes himthat makes total sense They also renamed the Iroquois to the Haudenosauneeand Kanyenke to Kanyen in the Definitive editionas it describes his name more accuratelyas his previous name was referring to a location rather than a nameBut unfortunatelythey were also incredibly lazy and didnt redo the voiceoversso now you can hear an audible cut everytime they mention any of these new namesconstant crashesfps dropspeoples name disappearing and instead being replaced with Player 18 They also utterly butchered the multiplayer menutheres no unique avatars to setno trivia that shows up like in the gold gametheres just so many things missing and the menu is generally bland all you have is a HostJoin and Ranked buttons The leaderboards are also extremely brokenand sometimes your wins even count as lossesabsolutely astonishingan absolutely amazing addition for sureas it scared off new people in the old gameunfortunatelyits so unorganized compared to the originaland sometimesthe game will remove a completely different card from the one you clicked Some of them also break certain factionssuch as the free fort shipment for chinayou still get the Fortbut now you cant upgrade your units for some reason Alsoeach of the decks for every single faction have three starting decksto help you get used to the playstyles of each Nation Unfortunatelydeleting them all and making your own one for Spain in particular makes Spain get deleted completely from your gameforcing you to restart itto which youll see that the country has completely resetincluding your levels and decks Hope you didnt level your home city oopsbut theres no setting to increase the population cap in your game like you can do in AOE II DE too That wouldnt work as well as in AOE IIconsidering in AOE IIIa lot of units are EXTREMELY powerful and take up to several popcaps to rectify that issuebut its still worth adding in my opinionwhile AOE II is a poster child that got love for the past 7 years with constant updates and national additionsif you knew that less people might play this onethen why even make an effort to release it This edition includes the Incans and the Swedesthe Swedes were an old cut content faction from the originalso it makes absolute sense to add themIncans were a very unique faction and AOE II players will feel right at home with them But that leaves the question Wheres Italy It was also a cut faction Wheres an Asian Civ Why didnt they receive any love like the natives and the Europeans did Dont tell me youre just going to leave it like thisMicrosoft If youre really greedy for moneyIm sure people would happily pay for DLCsand the only way of getting them out is by deleting them and feeding your enemy XP Ohwhats that Your Explorer got stuck on that trading post your ordered him to build Must suck to be you The AI also still focuses on walls over any other priorityeven when the walls are broken and they can pass right through Sometimes theyll kill a unit they seeand then proceed to just sit there for the next fifteen minutes before doing anything else and the new Extreme AI just never attacks youExtremely broken Id sayand considering in what a sorry state this game isI can completely understand people being angry about it They renamed the Iroquois and Sioux like previously mentionedas those names were given to them by their enemiesokaycool So was Chinas They also redid the voiceacting for bothand its beyond atrociousI wouldnt be surprised if the people who were recording them deliberately halfassed them just to deter people from playing them Theres only two voiceactors for both Sioux and Iroquois now Male and Female For both Nationsthey sound extremely atrocioustheres no emotion put into it at alland to top it offtheyre EXTREMELY QUIET At first I thought that maybe they just didnt have the resources to hire a few competent people to record those linesbut the Incans sound just greatand theyre new The only issue they have is their Explorer being quietwhich is most likely an error They also changed the firepit to a communal plazawhich is the most laziest thing Ive had the honour of seeingI cant tell you how many times I kept looking back and wasting precious time during a multiplayer game just looking if my villagers are actually working in it or if theyre idletheyre barely any animation or life to it And they applied it to every Native civ for some reasonbecause Im sure Aztec war priests just stood at community plazas frozen in place for all eternity To be inclusivethey also made it so Iroquois and Sioux cant mine goldinstead you have to waste 25 wood to build a tribal marketplace that lets you magically farm that goldsince you have to place them right next to the gold mineswhich prompts your villagers to pretend to be collection pelts as they do the default farming animationquite amazingId say Dont instantly blame the devs on that onethoughblame the amazing Competitive community that cried about the mechanic being too unique to the originalhence why they made it as it isso that they couldnt just farm gold infinitelyas if plantations dont exist OhsorryI meant Estates They renamed them and completely removed the mention of slavery in the Ingame encyclopedianice way to take a few steps backis that why theres still Black Russian villagers that you can recruit for whatever reason They also renamed the Discovery and Colonial age to Exploration and Commerce age respectivelyI dont know where they pulled those terms outbecause Commerce age doesnt exist They also added a Historical battle to the gamea new featurebut that didnt stop them from censoring stuff either Andrew Jackson is present in one of thembut just simply named American Generalwhich I can only presume is like that because he signed the Indian removal Policy Seriously If youre so afraid of history and the repercussions you might have received by remaking this gamethen why did you even bother They also didnt bother reworking India or Chinadespite people literally showing them the absurdities they included in them Cant write anymore The AI still doesnt work on water maps Eg if you play on Ceylonthe AI stays put on their tiny starting island and stops doing anything because they run out of wood As another exampleif you play on Honshuyou can expand onto the second major island where youll be safe for the rest of the game because the AI will never follow you there The devs shouldve fixed this problem fifteen years ago Ill update my review ifwhen the devs fix this problemThe launch was horrendousto say the least The game had more bugs than a rain forestbut more work is needed until the game is truly stablethe game is in a playable state right now and I took my time until i wrote my reviewas I believe that you can only rate a game after at least a couple of weeks of playtimethe network component of the game is infinitely better than the laggy experience of the originalthe Swedish and Incas are a fun addition and the changes to the previous civilizations were smartly implementedyou cant whisper or invite anyone from inside the game unless you are in a chat channel with them or in their clanyou need to communicate with them outside of the game SteamDiscordetcthanks to the UIit is quite a decent gamelets hope they fix more bugs and crashes and improve the menues ingame so the games online population can strive and become largerI will give the game a positive review for nowI will edit this review appropriatelyAfter 1000 hrs I can say despite the tumultous nature of the time I am super happy with this game It needed some more polish before release but Im happy that they went through the release cycleless balance issues no OP abusno old han or bustno 1010 sepoys always wins and while sure sweden and inca needed adjustment Im really really happy with the state of the game and how well the developers supported the game They really listened and after 15 yrs of lack of support this past year was a very welcome oneThis remaster does a good job of updating UIgraphics and fixing the home city mechanics that put a lot of people off of playing multiple civs in the previous release Mostly everything enjoyable about the original core gameplay is kept present in this releaseit brings up the question of why other civs havent been changed to reflect their own endonyms Why are the Indians not Bharat Sweden Sverige or Germany Deutschland This seems like a very Americentric design approach based off of recent historical revisionismthere is not really an effort to change the depiction of any Asian or European civs and the effort gone into changing the admittedly crude representation of native Americans is ultimately jarring as it cuts and rearranges elements of the game Elements of audio are awkwardly cut and changed with new voice acting that is honestly pretty poor in performance Ultimately some of the changes to civs actively make them worse to playthese changes just seem to shy away from and deliberately misrepresent the Early Modern period of Historyscrubbing out any reference to anything that could be deemed controversial Andrew Jackson being simply referred to as American General is very strange also as it goes against the teams previous ethos of accuracy It really just feels like an attempt at concealing history and as such the changes really only took away from my experience of the game They were unnecessary and kind of patronisingespecially to anyone with an interest in the time periodIf you liked Age of Empires III gameplayyoull like this Fair warningyou are basically paying for a slightly better looking AoE with two new civs Now mind youif this was any other game youd probably be ok paying 15 for two new factionsor rather you wouldnt be ok with it but you would do it anyway Consider thatand consider that you also get a discount on this if you own Age IIIand who understands the current political climateI understand and support why you changed the

be considered unsavory in our 2020 worldjust note that the European communities represented are also stereotypes Why is this important Because its a VIDEO GAMEAge of empires III has been my favourite game for as long as I can remember The multiplayer is super janky and some days it is impossible to start a game 8 player games are impossible to finish and improbable to start There are too many insane and unnecessary changes to count Native war chiefs can no longer tame wild animals because that is racist but a Chinese monk can punch a bear and turn it into a humanWhere to even beginwhich was one of their coolest featuresand the North American natives can no longer mine and are required to construct an additional building to be able to acquire coin Changing things in the game to be more accurate and considerate towards people who were presented in the game in a way that was ignorant or even disrespectful is finegreat evensuch as changing the names of the civs to what they actually call themselvesbut changing core mechanics and lazily introducing them is not This is an absurd and unnecessary change that is an insult to veteran playersthat is built around the theme of colonialismaround the era of colonialism and whos entire gameplay is based around building a colony cant have the colonial era in it because it is too offensive Was colonisation an awful thing for many peopleYESabsolutelybut it happened and its what the game is based aroundthe game isnt making it out to be some glorious thing This change of course does nothing to the actual gameplay so Im not going to give up on the game just because of that but it is extremely idiotic and uselesshoweverit only unlocks the customization options for the visual appearance of your home city and no longer unlocks shipment cardsas you now start with all of them While this works great for multiplayer as you no longer have to grind of out matches to get the cards you need to stay competitiveit is awful for singleplayer There is no more sense of progress or goals to work towards and the main replayability of singleplayer is simply gone This is the change that makes me just not want to play the gameI used to love unlocking and experimenting with different makeshift shipment decks as I worked my way up to the more powerful onesbut that is no morethe deck editing menu is nigh unusableits essentially just a massive blob of the possible shipments you can use with very little sorting options The original deck editor showed you what building the card typewhat era you could get the shipments in and the progression trees all at the same timeallowing for easy location and identification of each card In the definitive deck editor you can sort by age or by card type thats itenjoyand the cards are in a seemingly random order with no visual separation making it a long unsorted messy list of shipments that fit said categoriesso be cautious in checking if your pc can actually run the gamehavent played with them enough to say for certain but Im not really picky with how strong or standout they arejust happy to have new contentnothing ground breaking but they generally look nicethere arent a lot of them but something is better than nothing at this pointwhich is nicethats about itits a shit showhowever they ruin a lot of the games nostalgia which is admittedly a sacrifice I think we can make and a lot of it is lazily donesuch the community plazawhere villages walk in circles for some reason and it looks ridiculous The fur trading building used to get coin is gathered by villagers as if they were plucking berries from the side of a building built next to a coin mine which they arent allowed to gather from but the fur trade drains coin from the mine Very historically accuratethanks devs Its just looks stupid and is clearly not very thought outbut once againdoesnt affect gameplay so its not that big of a dealaccumulated over the span of over a decade and to see its legacy end with this disappointing mess makes me extremely sad Ive been beyond hyped since the first Definitive Edition was announced as I was hoping that AoE  would get oneand I was even more hyped when AoE  was confirmed to get one I am not hard to please when it comes to remakesI would have been satisfied and given this game a positive review if it was simply a graphics upgrade with nothing else but they went ahead and made changes that no one wantedremoved content and sucked the soulthe character and the passion from the gameall in one fell swoopIm notIm fine that the changes to the names and appearances of the nationsbuildings and other things make the game more inclusive What I am not ok with is compromising the gameplay for the those reasons Its likely my fault for giving off that impression as my paragraph on the whole colony renaming ordeal made it out to be a lot more serious than it really isI dont want to see it failI want to enjoy it In its current statehoweverI dont see myself playing much of it and I would love to see that changedThis game takes me back to when life was way easierAfter 100 hours of playingit is timeI experienced what they were going through crashesglitchesstutteringlagweird AI behavioretc They were right and on point My apologies for misjudging youI expected this to happen I told my friend that we should wait for the reviewsgameplay videos and potential bug fixes before we get it I wanted to play it bug free as would any reasonable AOE fan We were bound to get it anyhow but I insisted that we wait Of course he didnt listen to me and bought it for both of us at launchAOE  DE is getting better and better Its still NOT perfectyou waited months and months and maybe even preordered itdisappoint you this way AOE  DE took a hard blow which it shouldnt deservenor should it deserve this rushed release considering all the present bugs and crashesI have faith in people who are passionate enough to make a remasterpassionate enough to communicate with players and make an effort to fix the bugsglitches that haunt AOE  DE I thank you one by oneAOE  DE looks fantastic The visualsthe sound designthe level designetc It really is absolutely gorgeous Multiplayer  skirmish work fine It lives up to how amazing the original was and adds much needed retouche This is undoubtedly a fun gameI wouldnt recommend getting AOE  DE right now necessarily Wait for a sale Yes this is not a full 60 or 70 game but it had a bumpy start thats still very noticeable and ongoingyes I am boredyes I am a fan of Age of EmpiresCHEERSOther reviews have covered the mess of bugsatrocious UIaudio errorsgraphical errors and so forthso I might as well cover another point of contention the changes made to make things more historically accurate You know that when youre greeted with a paragraph talking about how they have removed problematic elements the devs wordnot mine to make the game more accurateyoure in for a ride The changes themselves are relatively minor some are as simple as recasting fifteen year old linesothers are as gamechanging as removing the ability of the Iroquois and Sioux who I will refer to as such to mine coin and instead forcing them to trade for it through buildings Some of the changes for the sake of historical accuracy actually do make things more accurate  mainly the name changes to some native units Others are just a blatant grab at brownie points such as the removal of all instances of the word coloniala game focused on the period of history that saw the growth of great colonial empires no longer has the word colonial within it  the Colonial age was renamed to the Commerce AgeColonial Militia were renamed to Revolutionary Militia Plantations were renamed to Estatesthe Discovery Age was renamed to the Exploration ageand  most puzzling of all  Light Infantry was renamed to Shock Infantry Meanwhilethe Sioux and Iroquois have been renamed to use the terms they referred to themselves as orratherthe Iroquois have  the Sioux were just renamed to the Lakotawho are not the only Siouan people to exist This was done in the name of inclusivity The old names did not prevent these empires from being added in the first expansion a decade agonor did it prevent anyone from getting into the game I also reject the idea that the new names make the game more historically accurate Not just because there is nothing inherently inaccurate about an exonymbut because of how selective the application of these changes werewho do not call themselves Japaneseare still Japanese and led by the isolationist Tokugawa in a global empire building game The Indians and Chinese are still led by the Mughal and Qing dynastiesdespite the fact that neither of these dynasties called themselves Indian or Chinese both those words also being European in origin or even viewed themselves as being representative of Indian and Chinese nationhood The Aztecs are still called the Aztecs despite the Mexica being the actual tribe that represented themif we want to go by the renaming convention for the Sioux The Ottomans  who were a dynasty  are still called the Ottomans rather than the Turks I probably shouldnt have to mention that the Germans dont actually call themselves German either It is not only wildly inconsistentit is entertainingly inconsistent in their effort to promote the terms that natives used to refer to themselvestheyd leave the Manchu Qingwho went out of their way to impose Manchu culture on the Hanrepresenting Chinaor still pretend that India is a uniform civilization best represented under a TurkoPersian Islamic dynastytheyve left things virtually unchanged for the Europeans and Asians Prince Henry the Navigatorwho was never a head of statestill represents the Portuguese despite all other leaders being actual rulers Napoleonwho gave up Frances colonial empire to pursue European hegemonyleads the French in a game that doesnt have European mapsand for some reason still flies the medieval Capetian coat of arms The Britishdespite their namestill have nothing representing the Scots unique to their rosterand the Germans are just Prussianswith the only thing representing something else in the HRE still being Czech War Wagons of all things Moreoverwhile the Iroquois and Sioux are restricted to trade posts for gathering coin in the name of historical accuracyEuropeans  despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of European settlers never set foot anywhere near a gold or silver mine  still get most of their coin through mining rather than growing tobaccomaking rum or trading furs like they actually did The implication of thisof courseis that the devs might think the Iroquois and Sioux simply wouldnt know how to mine precious metal deposits if they were presented with them  given that their removal of all terms referring to colonization also implies that the natives were Noble Savages who didnt engage in empire building or colonization of their own and that the Europeans didnt even colonize the New WorldI can believe that the devs are actually that based and paternalisticthe actual reason is more likely that the devs just wanted to virtue signaland went about it in some of the most thoughtless and wasteful ways imaginable And I do mean wasteful They spent timemoney and effort in consulting native tribes and recasting fifteen year old voice lines because someone might have found them problematicrather than doing something actually inclusive like allowing all empires to customize their home city a feature still restricted to the original eight European empires or otherwise actually applying more polish to their remaster I would not call this a remaster either The graphical updates are nice  when they work  and the Swedes and Inca are a plusbut aside from that and having access to the entirety of your card deck from the start there are no further improvementsand the mechanical changes made to the native empires were to their gameplay detriment This is not a remasterthis is an expansion pack with a graphics update  and the only saving grace is that it is at least priced like an expansion pack

childhood nostalgia Even if you do buy itstay away from modsthey can delete your filesas many has found outthe hard wayA handy guide to deciding whether this is the game for yousince reviews and several forums are being raideda lot of reviews and forum posts are popping up about changes that have been invented by their respective OOPsare complaining about random changes actually requested by the communityor are filled by flaming from members of a few different groups that decided that this game should be review bombed due to political reasonsor because they think its a waste of time since they prefer AoE2here is a short summary of actualconcrete pros and consas well as a short debunking of the most common made up arguments Lets have a short FAQ about the misinformation being distributed as a part of the raids at the momentthe models are just more detailed Some people are experiencing weird blurriness that will cause the game to look more foggy and cartoony as some people have put itbut there are a few workarounds or you can refund and wait until they fix it if that occurs for youbased on the fact that you get stockhome cities instead of having to make a separate one if you want to play a faction Youre able to name your city and explorerand customize it just as you can in the original release of the gameand see how many home shipments you have availablesince the UI elements and unit rendering through trees are there pretty much just as they were with the original releasewithout grinding first This was one of the most requested changessince the existence of the homecity card unlocking mechanic was one of the biggest things that pushed people away from multiplayer when the game first launched Several good arguments have been made to why the old progression system should be implemented into singleplayerso well have to hope the devs will add that in the future The singleplayer communitys arguments are goodand its sad that their gripes were hijacked and mangled by raiders and review bombersrun over by SJWsbut the short answer is noand this whole topic has been blown out of proportions The devs basically ordered a short list of things to change from Native American consultantsas well as thought of some changes by themselves They basically changed a few words in a few text filesand made a few mechanical changes that were luckily goodas the things that affected game balance were mainly buffs to underpowered thingsso the effects of this to multiplayer were mainly positive It has to be saidthoughthere is also a big downside to what they didin terms of what they didnt do at the same time Basicallythe changes they made were really lackingand they didnt follow through with making all of the changes that should have logically been made according to the principles that were used to justify the changes they made Several really weird things were left unchanged with the nativesand the Asian civs were left in a really janky state in terms of historical representation and accuracy Several members of the games Chinese and Indian communities have already been vocal about thisso if youre interested in what went wrong with the India and China civsthere are plenty of posts around detailing the flaws therethe changes dont really affect the game since the changes being referred to in OMG THE DEVS ARE SJWs posts are a few changes to text stringsand if they bothered you theres been a mod that reverts them since day onesome people dont If youre seeing pages upon pages of copypasted AoE2 is the best AoE is for retards threads somewhereyouve just seen an ongoing raid Its a cringy sightI knowunlike other AoE gamesIII is heavily balanced around population costs and AoE damagemeaning that it becomes completely unbalanced and unplayable with a higher unit cap It probably would have been nicer to have a setting to have it higher in custom gamesbut its more of a small oversight that could have been nice for a few peoplerather than a big flaw or something highly requested that was left out This release is extremely multiplayer focusedand a higher unit cap setting wasnt a priority for competitive multiplayer play If that was something you were looking forward to and wont buy the game because of thisthats understandable as welllets go through the cons firstas well as other visual bugs Be prepared to wait or refund if youre experiencing these These include bugs that stop you from progressing in the campaignconnecting to people or seeing multiplayer lobbiesif youre interested in thatyoull most li
1,Surviving the Islethe game comes with a very steep learning curvewith no tutorialand only recently introduced hints to help you start your experience Q makes you sniff for food and waterE lets you interact with thingshowever what they dont tell you is how to actually survive If you thought all you had to do was keep your hunger and water bar fullboy are you in for a treatit matters staying out of sightand it matters what colours you chose for your dinosaur Staying out of trouble is going to be your hardest lesson to learn Sounds simplebut people in this game has it down to a sciencedon’t make the mistake of choosing an apex predator like a tyrannosaurus or a giganotosaurus right off the bat They take most of a day to grow into adulthood and chances are you won’t get there at all in your first playthrough Choose something manageable like a utahraptordilophosaurusGalimimusor dryosaurusthe trees and bushes will for the most part help cover your outline Once there you should sniff and look for the nearest water sourceyou might have to walk a bit before you can really sense any Make sure not to sprint therefor that will drain your food and water quickerand ultimately your stamina bar as well You never know when you will desperately need all of the aboveeven if its just for a few bites Herbivores eat a specific bush smell them with Qand carnivores eat meat either alive or from corpses smell for corpses with Q Once youve found your water source make sure not to linger Bigger and badder things will eventually make their way to youso make sure to stay out of sight When moving across the landscape never walk in the open You might think you have the advantage of a better view into the distancebut youll be surprised by how quickly a bigger dinosaur can reach you once they’ve already spotted youand most seasoned players can tell your species and age from the sound you make Lastlydon’t be too trusting to other players While someone might be the same species as you and therefore a possible allycannibalism is not an uncommon thing although not as common after AIs were introducedhowever if two starving Allosaurus see a fresh young onethey might just decide they’re better of with a snack than the responsibility of helping you out Some people will aid youbut others might notand its important not to take it too personally if they dontI would recommend playing on the Official Servers They will always be labelled Official Server EUUS through 13 There are considerably fewer rules on themwhich means you won’t accidentally break one of them and risk a permanent banand they do not require you to join any discord server There is no global chatwhich to some is a disadvantagebut it also helps you stay detached from other players You’d be surprised by how salty someone can get after trying to grow a TRex for the third time they take five hours to get to adult and once again gets killed halfway through While you could argue there’s the benefit of asking for advice in global chatI would say it’s much more fun to enjoy the game as it was intended One dinosaurone lifeand an unforgiving world where most other things will try to eat youDarwinisticPVP experience where only the strongest and smartest survive It can easily be enjoyed with friends or family but be prepared for a challenge This game is not for the faint of heartIts quite a unique game If you play on Teutonic Servers is were the Game really shines Just watch the Video Essay from SovietWomble He said everythingI felt forced to post a positive review based on the many negative reviews that simply failed to fact check or have no idea what theyre talking about I am referring to those who complain about abusive admins and the sortbut fail to mention they went onto player rented servers that are in no way affiliated with the game itself or its developersadmins The people getting banned get banned from player run serversNOT official serversUSUS3EU1EUEU3 and theyre tagged with official server THESE are the servers run by the game developers themselves and they do not abuse a thing therebecause it does not But they simply failed to check this and just acted like they knew

the thing that had killed mea Dilo I decided to play it different this time and stayed away from watering holeslooking instead for a densely covered river to shelter near until I could grow some During this timesome very interesting things happened During my first two spawnsI was just running around willy nilly looking for foodand was thinking to myself woweven though theres 180 other people on this serverI havent really seen anyone else lol wellthats because noone else was running around willy nillybuilding my courage up to go hunt for a meal since I was getting hungrya freakin FULL GROWN T REX went stalking byless than thirty feet in front of me he had seen me run that way earlierand was hunting me Terrifiedmy first instinct was to boltbut I knew I would be no match for his powerful stride and he hadnt seen me yet So I stayed put and thanked myself I had camod my skin colors pretty well on spawn as the Rex kept on going until he disappeared from view in the thick underbrush I stayed put for about five more minutesand was just about to rise from my resting position to go hunt for food when out of nowherethree or four Utahraptors came screaming out of the bushes 100 yards away straight for me I thought to myself wowhow the hell did they see me As I felt myself starting to get discouragedfrom the bushes behind the raptors burst the T Rex in an all out sprint the raptors hadnt seen methey were running from the Rex Remember the scene in Jurassic Park where they hop in the Jeep and run from the Rex after the water starts trembling in the cup The part where the Rex suddenly bursts out of the forest coming for them It was just like that And then a second Rex appeared on my rightcutting off the retreat path of the raptors leaving them nowhere to gosince we were in a gully I watched those two Rexes utterly destroy the raptors and eat them all except for one once they leftI snuck over thereate the free mealgot a drink of waterand then came to write this review with my hands still shaking from the excitementfolks If youre on the fence about this oneget off the fence BUY IT It is the most fun I have had in a multiplayer game in YEARSand the tension is utterly insane when someone is hunting youThe first thing to know about The Isle in 01 is the two separate versions Legacy and Evirmaand the version most people play It has lots of dinosaur species and a very active playerbaseAI dinosaurs for carnivores to hunt downmassive well detailed maps dotted with human landmarksriverslakesmountainsjunglesgrasslands and beachesand two main gamemodes survival and sandbox In sandboxevery nonexclusive dinosaur in the game is playable You start as an adult and basically do whatever you want This can range from Death Matches to Dino Chatting Rooms In survivalless species are available but the gameplay is more dynamic You start as a baby dinoeither a juvenile on your own or a hatchling with a mother As you feedhunt and surviveyou grow in size and strengthbecoming faster and more formidable until you become a fully grown adult It is often necessary to form groups with members of your own species to better the chances of surviving If you are a female dinoyou can have your own young when you become adult The nesting system allows other players to teleport to you as hatchling dinosbut they are completely dependent on you until they become juvenilesno longer receiving updates from the devs As suchit has lots of bugsranging from minor annoyances to game breaking glitches such as oversized hitboxesrubberbandingFPS dropsdisconnections and more There are also a few tricks that undermine the basic values of the gamesuch as tail riding It can be more than infuriating when you lose your dino to something only describable as bad game design Food spawns are also fickle Certain regions of the maps lack AI for carnivores or bushes for herbivores As suchmany players tend to gather around hot spots rather than explore the maps There are also toxic players who partake in frowned upon behavior such as carebearing or taking care of dinos that arent your own speciesor KOSing or killing everything in sight for funa complete recode that was started after the Legacy code became too troublesome and frustrating for the dev team to work with It has a lot of the features that Legacy had with more yet to comein addition to many exciting new features including an entirely new mapnew dinosaursreworks of old dinosaursnew mechanics such as grazing for herbivoresgrabbing dragging and swallowing kills for carnivoresnew playstyles for unique creatures like pteranodon and deinosuchusand new systems for foodperks and elder dinosaurs Everything in Evirma is much more fluent and natural than Legacyfrom movement to combat to the ecology of every distinct speciespossessing a far smaller dino roster than Legacy some features like the diet and elder systems have yet to be addedand as usual there are bugs Howeverthere have been regular patches and bug fixes from the devswith a roadmap for future large scale updates already planned outThe Isle is a very unique take on the survival genreand a delight for fans of dinosaurs and paleontology Progress has been slow but steadyand the game already has a lot of promise with its dynamic gameplay If you love survival games and dinosaursthis ones for you If youre more a fan of fast paced gamesmaybe pass on this one Growth takes a while DAs of right nowI am unsure if I love or hate The Isle Im still going to recomend it because the game stands well and has earned my respectbut keep this review in mind when thinking about buying the gameeach altered personally for him and little is reused between the different types They have their own sounds and each a different sound for the different communications such as friendly vocalization aggressive vocalization longrange call and so much more that only adds to the realism this game is trying so hard to produce The minimalist UI is effective and out of the way as to not take the players view away from the visuals too often aside from when the dinosaur needs to eatto drinkor to rest for a moment and regain energy lost while sprinting Each bareither of hungerthirstor energyneeds to be managed similarly to human survival situations You shouldnt waste energy on sprinting everywhere you gofor exampleif you are a lone herbivore under threat of being hunted in an area frequented by predators You need to save that energy for when you must run away You can regain lost energy by walking or faster by lying down That saidthis is a slowerpacedsurvival gameso those looking for a fastin the moment gameId wait and see where the dev team is headedfirst Humans were mentioned in the past and we are currently unsure of if they will be added or how they will opperatethe most problems I have ever had with this game have been with the user interaction The Isles multiplayer is the reason I bought the game in the first place and I truely believed that I would be getting into something where I could play close with other players in herds or hunting parties that carried on realistically as dinosaurs might once have That isnt what I gothowever What I got was a beautiful game with large maps in which finding other players was a very difficult task and one constantly hindered by hunters who aimed at newspawns for their food Each timeId respawn in different locations I tried to remedy this by joining multiple steam groups with their own servers that told me they could help me to have fun and play the game like I had originally wanted to This was more or less a lie The progression system is in place to stop players from playing the stronger dinosaurs right away and ruining everyone elses good time on survival servers sandbox servers just have everyone deathmatching The problem with this progression system is that everyone else in the community is always ahead of you in progression due to the fact that these communities are diehard players that only play this game They are always a higherranked dinosaur and no one wants to play with the smallerstarter dinosaursnot even other starter dinosaurs In spite of the communities best effortsI found myself stuggling to have fun in this game and its appeal lessened and lessened I had watched countless videosread many reviewsand yetThe Isle was NOT what I expected it to bethis game is good Not greatbut good The Dev team is putting a great deal of work into the game and I will give credit where credit is due Howeveras the game standsI DO recommend buying itbut I caution you Whatever you expect it to be likeits not like that This game is hard to read through other peoples eyes You need to get it yourself to see how youll enjoy it If you dontthen refunding it is always an optionso I shouldnt be allowed to review it and then obviously not read the review I dont need 100 hours to review a survival game about walking around hunting or standing around eating plants It doesnt take long to get what he game is aboutso stop acting like Im missing some bigspiritual thing by not playing this game religiously I still recommended the gameso Im not hurting the developers and I simply put in my own opinions while asking others to draw induvidual conclusions based on their tastes I didnt personally enjoy the gameso Im not going to play it any more than Id like to Thats my choice and Im sorry that Im not showering this game with madeup praise overflowing out of my mouth and ears because some people think I need tobuteven though I didnt like itI kept eating it and telling the company its great while also eating more and more of it after already finding out that I didnt like it It doesnt make sense I personally believe that you can review this game afterat leastfive hours of play Most survival games with little to no story dont need too much time and it doesnt take that long to figure out if you like it or not The review system is there for people to give THEIR opinions of the game If you dont like one reviewfind another or review it yourselfespecially seeing as someone with 117 hours in the game told me it was a great review and that I hit the important aspectsbut I guessto those of you who think Im a moron because of my play timehe must be an idiottooright Those 117 hours mean nothing because he doesnt agree with youI genuinely loved this game  I have sunk around 00 hours into it  Howeverat this point I cannot recommend the game  I think the premise of this game and existing framework could produce an amazing game in the future  I am unsure as to whether or not this will be accomplished at this pointand several unique playable dinosaurs  Each dinosaur needs to worry about food and water  Thats about the extent of the gameplay at this point  All of the public servers are limited to progression modeand private servers can choose sandbox modeto say the least  You start off as the lowesttier herbivore or carnivore  As eitheryou have very little time to find food or water  Every minute you are in the gameyou accumulate a progression point  Once you have enoughyou can unlock and spawn as a different dinosaur  It can take several hours to progress through these branches  Every time you dieyou lose all of your progression  You have to start completely over whether you lasted  minutes and starved or spent 4 hours unlocking new dinosaurs  This system has very little rewardand once you have played all of the dinosaurszero reward My experience with this mode is that its an exercise in frustrationrun around a lotand talk to friends You need to worry about eating and drinking This hasnt changed much since the releaseand wonderful soundssoundtrack  The developers recently released an updated map that is absolutely stunning  I truly enjoyed exploring the map in sandbox mode  There are several screenshots availablebut here is a link to MeatyLocks youtube video that shows off this new map httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvSrMmnRTebJAif I can even say that  Currently there are many issues with rubberbanding and widespread lag across all servers  I was forced to turn the shadows to medium in order to achieve FPS over   Everything else is set to epic  I have a 970 GTX carddesktop built this year  There are many players with better specs that have issues  There are currently a lot of bugshungerthirstor optimization patches  The patch notes are incredibly uninformative and briefreply mostly with snide remarks and insultsand seem to really get a kick out of itthe lead developer recently posted a thread saying he was temporarily removing sandbox to get more feedback on progression  Howeverwhen given feedbackthe developers sing the same tune in every threadbelittling player ideas and input  The first thread that emerged from progression with genuine ideasfrustrationsand feedback had a response from Dondi that said “Found the thread of people who dont know how to hunt”  That was the only developer response to roughly 9 pages of feedback httpssteamcommunitycomapp37610discussions0394391748864but there are quite a bit of posters on the forums that detail what they like and dont like  When a developer is openly hostileit doesnt quite feel worth it  The thread is intended to make a joke of player opinions disguised as desiring feedback httpsteamcommunitycomapp37610discussions0394391733096491mostly dismissed by telling players that its only going to be more difficult and theres no issues for them to progress  Im not exactly sure what kind of feedback they are looking for at this pointat their own expenseand have clearly stated server rules in the title  One server was specifically set up to relax and communicate with other playerscalled the Chill Lounge  The rule was no KoS kill on sight  One developer Deathlyrage incited a raid on this server where players intentionally entered it and broke this rule  Unfortunately only one moderator was on at the time and she had extreme difficulty controlling the chaos this caused  She was understandably upset after being alone for hours on end trying to enforce server rules  Her post on the forums was met with insults directly from the developer  The thread is here httpssteamcommunitycomapp37610discussions03788711730644discordand Dondis stream  The general environment of these platforms is incredibly toxic  A lot of players enjoy the game for different reasonsand players that play differently are vilified  A game that is diverse and promotes different styles of gameplay should be celebrated for accommodating a wide variety of gamers  I dont think those players should be shunned and insulted  Many examples are visible on the discussion pageand not in line with the practice of ignoring player feedbackprogressionand playable dinosaurs have been added since Everything else that still needs to be implemented workshop integrationcontroller supportVR

barebones sandbox at best  Developers recently implemented a strict ruleset that is not engaging or rewardingcalled progression   Developers are rudeuncommunicativeand enjoy insulting their players  Development seems to be working backwards  Developers are focusing on balancing this rulesetwith most of the content not implemented into the game yet  Game is currently poorly optimized with low FPSserver lagserver crashes periodicallyand rubberbandingWell ive decided to write this after alot of thought  I did enjoy the game when i started itits still in early access and bugs are to be expectedmostly weve laughed over themits alot of pvp at the moment but thats where the issues start to arise sadly Not so much with the game but the devs and forum mods Which is what brings me to review this so poorly All of the expeiences are myself and friendsfreezingplayers asking for the lag to be addressedand hopefully worked onto which all are replyed to Get a better computer and  Connection bugs on ISPs not paying feesthreads are locked and deleted if they are questions related to where the game is headedanything on breeding or any discussion on thoughts to different dinos abilities and looksDondia post was released in the forums by a dev deathlyrage stating to Ask about the new breeding system So many of us went into the stream to ask to which nothing was anweredno talk of it and everything relating to it was ignored After which this post was deleted and denied Thou a few people like myself kept copiesplayers will always talk and wish and express what they want toits freedom of speech But when the mods go in and lock threadsshut down poststell people Thats never going to happen when they are only modban others because they dont like what they post or just have issue with the players themselves in the game That is immature and frankly turns me away from this game  anyone even breathing a word of it is publicly ostracized by both the community AND devssome comments from the people that do the locking and deletinga list of people that they have banned for what  and why are they sharing this infojust save yourself the headache and anger and fustrations and avoid itit was the same old nonsense with now Mods  yes they allowed mods into the game to which a whole new group now harass and bully modders for creating As the devs put it Dont make it look bad and people wont hate it  Wow justdinosaurs  I love how they look makes me wondering if they got the game free as the detail is pretty slim to none all to gt the postitve ratings upunless you enjoy walking a tightrope of careful wording the moment you get into the game or forumsheaven help you should you try and ask for helpan interesting listen from youtube on one of  the isles devsI was a Gallimimuslow on water and sprintinghoping Id stumble on a pondwhen I rocketed over a drop I didnt see and broke my legexcept for the other Galli  It walked with me a wayssat with me while I waited for my leg to healand then when I was wellled me to water Her name was Leanaand she was waiting on coordinates to rejoin her herd We chatted awhileand discovered we both wanted to evolve to Maiasaura next We agreed to do this together She got the coordinatesand we headed outspoke of carnivoresthen folks stopped responding All of a suddenwe were a herd of two We made it to a lakebut couldnt stop to drink there was roaring and a carcass nearby We ran when Leana spotted the Acro responsibleshe saidto the lake on the other side We made it a good ways up the mountain before we hit a dead endand we realized we had to go back We were low on water by thenbut we could maybe make it to Acro lake and if we were fastget away before he spotted usbut neither of us could afford to wait I told her to evolve to Maia without me Dont worry about meI can make it to the lakeI made it to the lake On my last fifth of health and limping myselfbut I made it and survived to Maia Ill find youiUpdated 1 year after posting this reviewihes responsible for the teams performance after all as hes the head of the businessplays and feels great It can and will be tweaked in the futureif you can believe the devs and fanboys that is The gameso faris already looking pretty gooddiverse and emerging mapsa lot of the community and its devs brings it downa lotgo swimming when youre about to die to deny food for others you cannot eat in waterturning up your gamma so your can see clearly at night totally kills the night vision featureofficial servers do not have this problem too much Official servers also dont have global chat which also helpsthere are not many populated servers to choose frombut its unreal to me on why the devs are allowing community hosted servers ask for money to play certain dinosaurs on their servers They know servers do this but they just ignore this Its mind blowing in my opiniontheir websitesteam and discord and some news is even distributed through streamers in the form of leaked content This makes it confusing to find the latest newswhether they are ingame or outgame relatedsome developersforum moderators rarely acknowledge this They choose to ignore these facts as they try to cover it up before and after these issues are fixed and act like it was never an issue in the first placewas continuously abusing his admin rights ingame in the past He was banned eventually but official moderators on the steam forums choose to act like nothing ever happened and continue recommending to buy the gameshowing way less servers then there actually are also applies to official servers I recommend just using the steam server browser available in the steam launcher as this fixes most of these issuesunprofessional and self centered devperson Ive ever seen You can check out his streams on Twitch TheDondi Most of the messages or streams of him which I have seen he talks about his disgust for his own community or hes showing he doesnt care at all what anyone thinksbecause he will do whatever he wants This is probably sarcasm or so I hope but nevertheless it isnt the way you should behave as the head of a company Its true its his game and all but talking like this is just very inappropriatemodelssoundatmosphere which gives the game a lot of potential On the other hand its pretty common to meet admins who break their own rules to your disadvantage especially on unofficial servers Devs mainly Dondi might act up unprofessional concerning issues with the game Furthermorethe community in combination with absurd madeup rules on how you should play make up for a toxic environment The game in its current state is mostly a waiting simulator until you grow up It gives the game an unsatisfying feel00iI bought The Isle coming up two years agoexcited i jumped straight in exploring and making friends Over the past  years ive had many adventuresmany late nights and many laughs When i first started playing their were two different gamemodesSurvival And Progression Survival consisting of Spawning in as a Baby Dinosuaur of your choice  thus growing to an adult if you dont meet your maker before hand and thats about it in the way of content or playabilty in my Opinion its lacking any sense of purpose and i found myself growing bored almost instantly when becoming and adult Dinosaur with nothing else to do but sit there and eat on occasionsthen the more you play the more points you would getwhen you have enough points you could progress down a certain tree of Dinos and it had a real sense of achievement Knowing when you saw a big Dinosaursomeone had put Alot of Effort and time into such a thing was a great feeling for me You had so much to gain and everything to losethe Ultimate Hardcore survival Experience  the community felt alive and everyone was friendly for the most part ill never forget the absolute gigantic herd of herbivores migrating through the harsh lands of The Isle which i was very lucky to be apart of It felt like i was in a movie fighting for survivalit was everything i had wanted and more  But and its a big but Progression was taken out of the game after an update Quite a while agopersonally i felt like this was the biggest mistake the Isle Devs have done thus fartaking out all sense of gameplay and content As for updates as many other reviews have stated  Updates come once in a bluemoonand odds are its just content for youtubers to make videos on or the devs to hop on the server and grief playersvery quick to ban players with no notice and what seems for no good reason for most servers there is a strict set of rules which for me and most other people follow with no problemwhich well come back too in a minute Pretty much every server has a Donation section of discord where you can donate real currency for an Adult Dinosaur of your choiceand alot of people go down this route which for me ruins the communitytheres a real difference when someone has spent 7 hours surviving to an adult and when someone gets it instantlyi feel like the donators are very careless with their dinosaurs and quick to rule break Because heyIll just spend another X Amount its fine Now going back to the ruleswith the rules in mindi personally had this happen to me and many others fell to the same fate i had just hit adult on a Female Triceratops 7 hours of work had gone into nursing this baby to adulthoodThen as is known to happenan admin Message Appears  then the admins will spawn in as a Hypo Dinosaur which is unkillable for Any dinosaurso as if being unkillable wasnt enough they proceed to Break there own rules and run around and kill every dinosaur in sighti dont know if its a ploy to get more people to buy dinosaurs but it felt unnecessary and excessive and they even has gone as far as using thier admin abilitys to Teleport onto a group of players just to end countless hours of hard work and you might think Well theyre big so i could just hide somewhere beneath a tree maybe Nopethey have everyones Nameplates on their screen so there is no escapedinos are nice but people are notI have withheld doing a review for this game for a very long timeas it has ever been in a state of constant change HoweverI now feel I can make my final say on this game Do not buy it This game has been in Early Access for  yearsand I have been around for over 3 of those years with almost 1300 in game hours Ive always held on to hope that all that this game promisedall the potential of an amazing concept would one day be fully realized But now it is clear that day will never comethey released an incredibly bare bonedbuggy mess of a demo with only  playable dinosand missing nearly every basic feature present in their original game They claimed this recode was necessary to build a better foundation that would allow for faster updatesbut a month into it weve seen only  basic patches with bug fixes and having to readd basic things like in game settings adjustments To top it offthese patches have broken more than theyve fixedas the game has no clear directionno clear goaland no clear way out of Early Access and into a fully realized game Now that there are other options for Dinosaur gamesthis game is quickly running out of time to deliver on its promisessomething that has failed to materialize in its previous  years of development Even from a conceptual standpointthis game offers little more than what content you can create yourself The novelty of being a Dinosaur quickly fades into boredom after a handful of hoursbut the grand promises and teases by the Dev team keep you holding on hoping for more It will never comethe lead Dev changes his mind and demands a reset that sets them back monthsif not years in development Given the incredibly poor treatment of his playerbaselack of ability to maintain a staffand apparent lack of goals for a full release of the gameI am now resigned to acknowledge that this game may in its entirety simply be a scama cash cow with no intent to finishbut to merely continue hyping up a playerbase with false hopeonly to offer excuses for why a different direction must be taken that restarts the cycle all
