The game also features the popular high-speed Skip Mode from the PlayStation4 version. With the touch of a button, you can jump between events and fields at twice the normal speed, and battles at four times the normal speed!


The Crossbell State

Bordered by the Erebonian Empire to the west and the Calvard Republic to the east, this prosperous state was once in crisis due to the actions of a fanatical religious group.

Tensions erupted in a mafia war, with security forces being manipulated by the mysterious narcotic, Gnosis. Peace was eventualy restored through the efforts of the Crossbell Police Department's Special Support Section. The Imperial and Republican officials associated with the Order and the mafia were driven away, and with a new mayor in place, it appeared that the future of Crossbell was bright; however, this was only a temporary respite on the turbulent Zemurian continent.

Pressure from the Erebonian Empire and the Calvard Republic is steadily increasing, and signs of yet another upheaval are imminent
among Red Constellation, the most powerful jaeger corps in the world, Heiyue from the Eastern Quarter, and Ouroboros, a mysterious organization that operates from the shadows.

All paths lead to Crossbell, and countless unsolved mysteries going back to ancient times are about to be revealed at last.

This is a story about living in modern times a gift to all those who fight to overcome the walls that bind them.",pos

Though Lizzie appears affectionate and devoted, it quickly becomes clear that she's so violent and unstable that a normal boy would run away from her. But when John sees her, he sees someone else suffering from a mental condition. John is willing to risk his safety for a chance to help Lizzie gain some mental stability.

"We did it!Thank you to everyone who voted for Merri Puzzle on green light. I hope everyone has as much fun playing the game, as I did making it.About the GameMerri Puzzle is a physics based puzzle solving game, with a unique look and feel to it. The goal is simple, getting an object, often a ball to the end of a maze. Your only controls are the forces of gravity, and building blocks. There are multiple ways to solve most levels. You can make block slides, block elevators, or just fill in the gaps. Other levels may need you to build walls to help avoid lava, or to get a key shape to the exit. As the game goes on, the amount of strategy required to solve each puzzle will go up. 

Merri Puzzle features a range of different mechanics. Some exits may be locked, some rooms may require making a path for two shapes to reach each other. Different shapes have different physical properties. Instead of building a bridge with blocks, you may try floating your ball across a sea of other physical objects you generated. Each level is unique with a different challenge. 

Merri Puzzle includes a simple check-point system. You can pick the way you play with point and click control buttons or key binding macros. This way you can play with a mouse and keyboard or your Steam controller.",neg
