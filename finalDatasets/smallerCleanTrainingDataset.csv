0,This game ruined my life I am not hating or anything I was from Dota 1 for like 34 years before Dota  was released and it didnt caught my attention to adapt the new theme of itan awesome game I really should have thought about spending money on a free game but to hell with it I say Mechanics are well designedwhat makes a hero OP is the player behind it and the team that surrounds it This is a team game peopleso team work is a must unless you are solo queuingthen you have to carry your garbage of a team but it can be the other way around Monster gamers are realyou can only be good at something if you focus on itlearn from mistakesbe aware of your surroundingstrust your instinctuse common sensetrusting on your team to always have your backbelieving in your capabilitiesalways try to be better than you were yesterdayand thatnot just friends but complete strangers too Dota  is a game that will never be forgottenI recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience painsufferingand torment because at the endyou will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get betterits just a game YAWAh1You learn how to learnhow to lose and most importantly you learn about youh1Dota is something elsesomething i have never experienced even when i was addicted to a mmorpg when i was 913 You learn how to learnhow to improvehow to win and how to lose The most important thing dota teached me was how emotions impact your performanceand that  saying nothing is sometimes the best thing to do In real life no one really teaches you stuff like that since people are kind of used to dealing with emotional assholesknowing myselfim really unsure of how much my life wouldve been different if i never started dota I asume i wouldve been a bit further regarding social contacts but careerschoolwise i highly doubt  that it wouldve made a big difference You gotta  be realistic when thinking about stuff like this Im not a very social guy I dont like to put work into stuff i dont care about The thoughts lets learn music  or lets study wouldnt have EVER crossed my mind when i was 15 Im pretty sure if i wouldnt have started with dota i wouldve just been gooning around the city and abuse drugssince thats a lot of fun to me Back then i actually never even thought about working on something to improvethat whole dimension of improving wasnt even there for me I just went to school got home and did fun stuff sometimes Thats it No goals No aspirationnothing Dota changed thatunlike studying or learning an instrument Just think about what kind of game dota  is that spending 1000s of hours is something you do with pleasure Its kind of insane thinking about it Once i started studying more for  school again i realized how much fucking time 100 hours is I garantue you that you  will be a top student if youd put 0 hours a week into studying outside of school But the big difference is that dota is just so much more fun and REWARDINGnot greatso

1,I dont think Ive ever taken the time to review a game in the 11 years Ive had Steam  However New Worlds current direction has compelled me to let future potential buyers know what theyre getting intopeople  Im old enough that many of the people playing this game could be a child of mine  My first MMO was Ultima Online PreTram and Ive played every major and most nonmajor MMOs since then  I love the genreeven if I dont always enjoy every game that releases in the MMO realmif judged by their actions aloneare clueless about balance and quality of userexperience in an MMO  Either that or they are making very purposeful decisions that set up future boost items in their cash shop  I really dont know which is the casebut recent changes have made it an even more difficult processbut the smaller servers are going to have problemsbut they nerf it every patch  They do this because those loudinfluential voices complain about healing  The Devs are not done nerfing healingmore will come because even after drastically reducing healing in the last patch and the 34 before itthe same voices are still complaining  Add in the lack of raid frames or even group member hotkeys and healing become a frustratingunfun experiencemagesbow  Outside the brief period when Hatchet was OP due to a bugthe Meta of GaxeWH hasnt changedIm surebut it is undeniably frustratingI am unable to recommend this game to new players due to the direction we can all see the Devs taking New World  They nerf based on the desire of the vocal minoritythey make end game harder to drag out the watermarking experience and they seem to create  problems every time they fix oneI called out some dude selling overpriced bags in global chat and started telling people how to find better prices in trade post by viewing all territory prices in top right of trade post menu and his entire companyguild said they were mass reporting me and I got a 4 hour automated ban for abusive behaviorIt feels a bit weird that there are taxes in an MMO created by AmazonIf numbers going up makes your brain make the chemicalyou will enjoy this game a lotStill cant find Lumbridge but some friendly players gave directions to VarrockI havent reached level 60 yet Im closeat 54but Im already feeling a bit burned out thanks to a myriad of weird design choices on AGS part For starterstheres no ingame restriction so that a faction cant control 90 of the landthus disabling 90 of the endgame content faction warfaremy own faction owns all but two citiesand this is mostly due to a big clan from another game just showing up in numbers and creating like 8 clans that just steamroll everything End result You cant play in a war if you arent from one of their companiesyou cant really do large scale PvP because almost no one from other factions bothers to go outside with PvP onand you cant even play the PvE invasionsbecause the ruling clan will abuse the kick mechanic to select 50 players instead of the 10 they should be selectingtheres a lot of other stuff going on that is slowly eroding my patience Imagine you go into a dungeon with your friendsfight all the way to the endthen one of your party dies when the final boss is at 5 HP Guess what you have to do if you want everyone to be able to complete their dungeon questget loot Yeahyou need to force a wipe because the game wont let that other player get their stuff or complete their missions Who thought that was a good ideathen while you are visiting another area which has extreme taxesthat item sells Guess what Youll get charged the extreme taxeseven if the item was actually sold on the lower taxes area Why Ask AGSbecause it makes zero sense to mebut so farit feels like it squanders more and more with every passing weekWe want Turkish language support There are those who want to start the game but cannot start the game because there is no Turkish language supporth1Summaryh1basically as soon as launch day queues settled I play on Utensiaa good middlepop server 1000 players peakno queues with all factions viable I level cappedhave a high gear score watermarkam officer of a PvP company that holds territoryand run all endgame content warinvasionsraidspvp arena I am at the end of the rainbow There is no pot of gold Its just a buggy messunfulfilled promisesand devs too busy working to implement server transfers to actually fix the gameso Im on the bleeding edge of the power curve on the server I got to be a part of all the server firsts buying territoryearly warsfirst invasionoutpost rushetcbyou will never have this experienceb because these experiences are dead There are no new servers and existing ones never reset War outcomes never change see more on that below The economic snowball rolls downhill Until the level or Gear Score cap risenew players simply cannot catch server leaders Amazon hasnt announced when an expansion will comebut I highly doubt many players will be around to see it If you start nowyou can still

to 100 players can surround and fight for a single point Stacking these spells balwaysb results in players on the point lagging outunable to move or attack Every war devolves into throwing AoE and lagouts back and forth between the two sides until one of them dies while lagged This takes forever to resolve and are thus wars are basically impossible for attackers to winyou literally arent playing half the time Amazon has done bnothingb to address thisrather than your aimer The healing interface on Life Staff is a mess These affect the core loop of the game combathoweveris resource tracking In lieu of minimaptheres a compass HUD that indicates the presence of resources nearby As you level gathering skillsnearby resources are automatically tracked on your HUD Except when they arent Sometimestracking just glitches and stops working at random Oops The kicker isthis feature is garbage You dont need it Resource spawn locations arent randomized They couldve avoided this bug by removing the feature they failed to implementbut also exist behind doors that brequire a player to have the quest to enterb As players finishthey can no longer help players behind them The final boss needs at least 5 players to kill reliably under 10 minuteseven at level 60 Naturallytheres an exploit that makes it possible for ranged characters to solo it Betting that will get patched before Wars get fixedbut the interaction between animation cancelingaction bufferingand server responsiveness just feels bad Take Fire Staff if you cast and hold LMB heavy attack before the animation finishesyou will do nothing after If you cast and hold RMB to blockyou will block immediately after Factor in potionsweapon swapsenemy abilitieslagetcand it all produces a very cludgy system that rewards micro

times The raid bosses are interestingbut most enemies youll see a thousand times throughout questing The crafting system is expansivebut the economy is borked Storage is scarce You can decorate your houseIm pot committed on the idea this game might get fixed If youre reading thisyou can do something else with your time You probably shouldbut there is a lot of walking At least theres autorun assuming it hasnt glitched outI cant recommend this game Review belowcrafted gear is worthless and doesnt sell as mobs drop insane amounts of gear Gold dries up at level 60 as new gold is only obtained via the main quest level and side quests The only way to make gold is the trading post but the only things that sell are tier 1 resources So with the many taxes its a race to the bottomyoull live in poverty I believe this has been done on purpose so amazon can sell goldadd on all the other taxes and repair costs its a miserable experience I feel like im paying rent and taxes IRLuntil you realise that 90 of the stuff you gather is worthless The only valuable goods are tier 1 resources because of how broken the high end loot system and crafting is For instance there are wolfs that you can kill on mass that drop the high end epic quintessence These were once 80g a piecei can now buy a batch of 1000 for 009 gold eachi AOE farmed for  hours and probably got about 40 epics100 blues and 00 green itemyoull skip through it allToo many bugstoo many balance issuestoo many liesTheres a lot to love about this gamebut ultimately I cant recommend it because it APPEALS NEITHER TO CASUAL NOR HARDCORE PLAYERS850 players on the server had to sit on the benchbut they couldnt even watch the war for fear of stream sniping Furthermore the game is a real grind which is hard for casual players to get intountil they realize that endgame itemization has few optionsbugsand a real scarcity of goldazoth required to grind Furthermorethose who do strive to stay at the top of the Gear Score and get invited to wars are soon disappointed by the war metawhich is an ongoing game of EXPLOIT THE LATEST BUG Much like politicsits not the team with greater coordination or skill that wins warsbut whoever is willing to cheat the best Somehowastonishinglywars have gotten laggier and laggier as the game has gone onwith recent wars reduced to complete and utter standstills in which you have no information to respond toonly random deaths and loss of objectives Like FPS gamesmost of the damagehit calculations are seemingly performed on the client sidewhich is ripe for abusebut the reach fundamentally exceeds the graspI know it seems silly that Ive continued to play it so long without recommending itbut the fact is I play it because its addictiveand several of my IRL friends have asked for my help leveling up to endgamenot necessarily because Im having a lot of fun right now There is a decent challenge to some thingsbut mostly its a sense of masochism and obsessiveness driving me on Are those characteristics by which to recommend No No they are notbNew Worldat launchis a mixed bag My review will be based on making it to level 0and only playing PVEbCombatCraftingUIh1it does not change much  expect many trees and rocksblocking and doing damage I found it very engaging You can mow through low level mobsbut have to take those above your level more seriouslyhealeror DPSloggingharvestingetc I found the UI to be clean and unobtrusive When I wasnt leveling weapons or progressing the storyI enjoyed harvesting materials and leveling crafting Its hard to explainbut its rather fun and peaceful A note on the UI  there is a LOT of room for improvement as far as adding groupparty indicatorsbuffsdebuffsetcfranklybland The main story mostly makes sense but its not quality Essentially its a corrupted world and you  The Hero  plus the 1000 other players milling around is the one who can stop it The side quests are very basic fetchkillloot quests without any real narrative There are journal pages to gather but they dont add to the world I find Im not driven to get back in the game simply to seewhat happens next in the story As someone who enjoys the story in gamesI did find this rather dishearteningEncumbranceStorageh1but at leastpleasefix the jumpbut it uses the same resource needed for crafting The good news is you get this resource frequently  the bad news isif you need to move around a lotsay for storage reasons see below you will go through the resource quicklyyour personal storage box is tied to each settlement There are 10 settlements in the game which means you will eventually have 10 storage boxes You can view all of thembut you can only move items around for a cost if your faction controls both the settlement youre in AND the settlement you want to withdraw from Icanteven begin to explain how frustrating this makes inventory managementId call this a bare bones MMO It has a great combat systemplenty of loot and theres a good level progression If someone is looking to enjoy a new openworld this has a lot of potential for the price point I have also heard the PVP is enjoyable but my closest encounter was a random duel with another player I really cant speak to the PVP elementthere are othermore established MMOs they should check out firstwaited in queue for an hourplayed for 11 consecutive hours after i got inonly to be defeated by maintenanceDO NOT BUY Amazon allows players to mass report each other and grant undeserved 4 hourpermanent bans without justificationFun if you dont try to speed though it Remember you dont have to solve the content with mathyou could always enjoy the process of becoming stronger 750 hours solo player here Full voidbent Maxed out everything except fishingfurnishing 150 This is my honest and tOxIc opinionrushed and most importantlydesigned to be a moneygrabbing addictive scam As of todayit is completely unplayable rubberbandingunresponsive inputbuggy animationslow fps for most players even if you have a monstrosity of a computer you cant play this game competitevelyitem duping since the BETA ignored by devs in the forum and labeled as a conspiracy from retarded redditorsas usuala countless amount of exploits that gave players and by principle factionscompanies advantages over legit playersan insane amount of bugs such as items magically disappearing from the gameplayers having their characters stuck or deleted90 of the passive perks not working as declareditems from legendary recipes missing from the gamemultiplied bosses that stacked themselves repeatitevely making players quit the progression of questsand the list goes on and honestlyI could go foreverchanging a game designed to be PVP from its coreto a redundant and cliche MMORPGwhere PVE consists in the usual kill 10 skelsopen 10 chestsget X item and give it to X NPC type of questwhich is basically more of the same old shit My question iswhat is new about this game Nothing Where are all the casuals that they appealed to Gone Was it worth it I dont knowlook at the server population chartswhere you expect to get that juicy and valuable rare ressembles a little to gambling and opening chests where you waste money maybe Except here you waste timewhich obviously is the samefarming the same  bosses for decadesand playing laggy wars and some stupid unskilled game mode called Outpost Rushwhich is also lagged haha Wellwhat about dungeons you say We have dungeonsexcept the chests were bugged and they dropped literally trashit took them  months to fix this not to mention that dungeons werefor some reasonlagged for two weeks after releasemaking them unplayable The only decent late game stuff you could do was Expeditionswhich are like open dungeons with chests that actually worked as intendedexcept that todaywith the latest patchthey decided to NERF the loot drop from said chestsand buff the mobs from expeditions by multiplying their HPjust so you have to grind more and waste more time there are no incentives at all The most fun I had was when I was lvl 10 to 30 and played flagged You get rewards by winning duels in the open worldbut these are only meaningless amounts of XP that will decrement in time Once you get to max lvlthere is no incentive to continue playing flagged and dueling other playerssince you only get 00 factions tokensa very unefficient way of farming said currency Not to mentionthat if you happen to find a player that is also flagged in the open worldit would probably be a healera disgusting class that is unkillable and has no skillwhatsoever that counters it If you are looking for a PVP gameexpect to play instantiated and safe PVP in the comfort zonessuch as Outpost Rushor wars for terrysanother unskilled and boring mode It is saidthoughthat the game will have arenas vs5vs5and suchbut will see At this pacethey will rush it and screw things upagainthere is something that needs to be clarified for new players that it is very unfair If you are oneconsider that the game has gone through two MAJOR DUPING PROBLEMSwhere dupers were left unpunished or were poorly punished 1 week bans The second onethat the game uses a watermark systemwhere you grind killing mobsopening chestsso your consequent drops are of a higher gear score more statsperk valuesdefatk Players that have abused the now fixed exploits such as tentacle farm are already maxed out in this watermark systemand alsoleft unpunished Not to mentionthat the drops from bosses that were grinded for watermark increaseand also chestsnow drop way less items The third onealso introduced with todays patchthat the great devs decided to increase the required XP needed to lvl up craftsso you will have to grind 0 times more than mefor exampleonly better graphics at the expense of perfomance A complete buggy shitshow Incompetent designers and devs Game needed at least 1 years of BETA before release It has pronouns in bio KEKthe devs decided to lower the taxes by 90which is goodand decided to give a stimulus check to those who had house taxes to pay I dont know what kind of weird specimens are coding in AGSsince after the hotfixplayers in EU logged in with extra gold said amount is between 50k00k btwso consider the impact that would have in the already fucked up economy Because this problem happened only in Europespeculations are that there was a typo in the expression of moneysince EU uses  and America a for separating thousands No proof of thisbut have no doubts that this is the case Ending upindividual rollbacks are plannedbut the issue is that players already made transactions with other players that are not going through said rollbackSo far its a decent game Has a few boring momentsthe story is mehbut I like the crafting system and combat When you get people together and go do pvp stuff its really fun My main gripe is the Dbags who got to level 3 and run around low level zones killing the weaker players trying to do pvp missions If youre lvl 5why not go fight players in that area It acts as a block to people from accessing the main draw of the game If you get killed doing pvp missionsthey auto fail and that kinda blows All in all its like a 710 so farI cut treesh1YOU STILL THINK THE GAME IS GOOD NOW  WITH ALL THE GOLD DUPING WHERE ARE ALL THE HATER  ROFLh1now that Ive cleared around 90 of the end games zonesI feel Im in a position to give a clearconciseshort and completely honest reviewunlike their previous initiativessticks with itbut it isnt all that entertaining right nowand Amazon appears to have no idea what they intend to accomplish with New Worldthe running simulatorand repetitive questingI all do now is farming Elite Chest and running around gatheringcrafting and put stuff on Auction Houseminingwoodcuttingetc deserve a raisethats basically it as far as pure pros go for mebut nothing special Maybe compared to Themepark MMOs the crafting is considered goodbut when compared to sandboxes the crafting is mediocre at best The gathering is the same as every other MMO which isnt a bad thing which is simply walk up to a gathering node and click a button to begin gatheringbut it feels so uninspired and bland Its not offensively bad so I wont put it into the con sectionbut it just feels lackinglike the people that made it didnt put any effort into it The way you fight mobs is the same at level 5 as it is at level 60 Since you only get 3 abilities per weapon your combat doesnt really evolve or become different as you level Youre not obtaining new abilities to weave into your comboits just left click  left click  left click  shift dodge  left click  ability 1  deadallllll the way until 60 Nothing changesget ready because for me there are A LOT of consthe The Living Crystal quest requires you to kill The Dryad BeastMalevolenceproblem is it doesnt spawn everthen appear back where they were when they accepted the invite Then another loading screen a second laterthen appear back where they wererepeated until the war was over If you did manage to load in there was a lot of lag and if you died you would either stay dead or be hit with a long long loading screen meaning you could not get back to help your teamaccept factiontown board quests that consists of kill 5 mobsloot 5 chests  return to settlement  kill 5 mobsloot 5 chests  return to settlement over and over and over againbut this game takes it to a whole new levelbut Amazonthe company the owns Amazon Web Servicessomehow have either abysmal servers of abysmal networking code The amount of server lag that is on my server EU Annwyn for the past couple of days has been insane It will take 5 seconds for chests to begin looting and then 5 seconds for the chests to finish looting Stuff desyncs all over the place and mobs teleport aroundnot including animals that roam the worldthese are the different types of mobs I can rememberhumanoid npcs made out of wood or wolves made out of woodit sucks because the game was obviously originally supposed to be a PvP Sandbox that got changed last year and it really really showsand if your company owns a territory then you get gold from the taxes that people pay when they do their daytoday stuff like crafting or trading on the Trading Postbut thats pretty much it You dont feel more powerful for being part of a company that owns territoryruining any chance at openworld PvP taking placebut if youre on your own youre just gonna get 1v5d The incentive to flag up is something incredibly small like 10 extra xp gain which is offset by the time youll spend fighting other playersyou will be very disappointed There are a total of 6 dungeons known as expeditions in this game in the entire game 4 of which you do while levellingwhile the last  are endgame ones Theyre not very long eitherI believe most of them only have  bosses each and theyre not very challengingwhich are supposed to be challengingare not challengingProbably the only MMORPG Ive played where I feel like Im running like a mad dog and doing nothing

1,Ive always asked myselfhow can people play a game for 1 hours and then give it a thumbs downruined by cheaters I log in to 4 or 5 new permban reports each sessionbut nothing changes Cheats are readily available and are preinstalled in internet cafes in many parts of the world Hit the death cam to spectate a HUYATV or DOUYUTV account and watch them 6x spray you with an AK from 1 yardsevery shot hitting you in the headGET GUD or REKT M8  its just sad It takes all of the fun out of the game Ive played for over 1 hoursIve paid for season passes and Ive been promised changes and improvements  it just isnt happening The devs dont care about about their player base and they dont listen to feedbackits probably one of my favourite games ever  certainly the game Ive played the mostI can put up with poor geometry and I can put up with not being the best player at this game But I cant put up with cheatsbuild a better cheat engine I will happily play against anyone from anywhere in the worldbut I dont want to play against cheatersstuttering everywhere regardless of how good your machine ischeaters in every single gamecomplete radio silence from the devsPUBG is the type of game where it starts off with not caring too much if you die in the first few minutes approx 9 players aliveafter a little while and some reasonable loot and gear has been foundyou would prefer not to die at this point but still not too fussed if you die approx 67 players alive After the 3rd4th blue circleYou start to believe that you can achieve the impossibleyou could possibly winyoull taste the sweet fruits of victory1 players remainingyouve made it to top 1but you still want moreno more mistakes or joking around nowyoure closelast 2 playersyou believe in thisyou can win But alasyou make an idiotic mistake You end as 2that moment will haunt you foreveryoull feel rageanger and above all serenity when you die because you know that the game is overuntil you start the next oneThis game is like dating an alcoholic Theyre a lot of fun to be aroundand you legitimately like them But they have serious problems that ruin the whole relationship You keep thinking theyll changebut they never will Instead theyll just try to sell you an Event Pass to see parts of their bodyAfter almost 1 hours of playingits time for me to voice my thoughts Ive owned and played PUBG since the official release on steamand Ive been there through the goodthe bad and the ugly Over two years in and the game runs like it should The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style Howeverwith the recent changes I cant recommend the game and not lie to myself and others Bots were recently added and theyre so brainless they just get in your way The biggest problem is the HACKING PUBG has never cared to ban hackersthey review your reports onebyone and seldom ban hackers Ive seen speed hacksaim botsno recoilyou name it Its honestly ruined the game when you cant win because a hacker will sneak around and ambush you When hackers are gone for good ill play PUBG all day long and change my review As it isthe game is dead to me right nowreworked Sanhok Map is improved a lot Hackers still problem Salty comments spreading like wildfire Send help21 hours ingamePubgCorpwe cant ban cheaterswe cant let you choose the map anymorewe cant improve AI for bots even though they are the only players in some matcheswe cant fix any lags problem  FPS stuttering  freezing or crashing issueswe cant do whatever you likeThis game was killed by greedy and incompetent developers They have made A LOT of money out of usbut they still refused to fix their gamethey kept releasing broken updates while turning a blind eye on actual problems such as rampant cheatingits still not as optimized as a game this big should be They are sueing Epic Games because they are seeing a dip into their profits and they are too self absorbed to realize their own incompetence is turning players awaynot a better competitorthey dont care about fixing what they already have nowthey dont care about youAfter 2 years and 22 hours of gameplayI was Permanently Banned from PUBG without any reasoning provided I have purchased every Event Passand even purchased ingame cosmeticsmaking the account worth a great deal to me in many waysand I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM If you view my account on PUBG Report CATDADDYTeDo you will see my stats they are not very impressiveas I am not a good player Ive always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings desync issuesglitches and bugs from updatesaimbottersetc But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurdbut in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the gameone of which was apparently violated It was not a personal responseas the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Banheshe just copied and pasted an automated responseBought this game in the morningi told myself Id play one moreafter 1 hours I realised that the sun went down xD3 years and 35 hours of gameplay and this game is still a jokeglitchesbugsFPS dropsdesyncyou name itI can live with all of the abovePecadoBoot CampPodvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire cityonly to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 2m midgame and ruin it for the entire teamit is a temporary ban  What do you mean temporary If you cheatyou should get banned permanently End of storycostumesseason passesetc instead of focusing on the more pressing mattersUpdated 632graphics have been improvedand animation and quality of life is much better Customization options have improved and progression is now present PUBG also provides one of the most grittybrutaland earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals presentand can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay And Id loveLOVE to say I could recommend the game now But honestly I cant Why The absolutely predatory monetization Were talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money I can let it slide for Apexand Warzone Why Those games are free This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game Id love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think Im paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind This season pass crap is the new loot boxes Vote with your wallet peoplesay no to this crapover a yearfor this game to fix itself PUBG provides a grittyrealisticpulsepounding shooter that none of the other battleroyale games on the market have been able to replicate Nothing feels quite like PUBG But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplaythere is too much garbage that comes with this game The hackers in every matchthe inexcusable bugsthe practically nonexistent content updates Im about done Im tired of watching someone who wasnt even aiming at me in the killcam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking Im tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from eventsto temporary game modesand hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing Im tired of the worst battleroyale loot and customization on the entire market The god awful soldier cratesand then crates you can get for ingame currency but need real world keys to buy Are you kidding me Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semidecent outfithalf of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace Surethey finally got around to bugfixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I cant help but feel frustrated Why do free games have a better bugfreehackerfreefunctioning system than the one I paid for Why do free crappy mobile game ripoffs of those games have better customizationlootand progression than the one that I paid for I was more than willing to give this game more time because of its alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were addedfixedand reworked But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated I cannotin good consciencerecommend this game to anybodyGame is OK Used to be fun until everyone started using cheats Wish Bluehole would FIX their anicheat agentI hate to say this and its sad to see  but the state of the game now is awful Yes it plays quite well and visually looks better than ever  but its really lost that PUBG magic and feel Empty feeling lobbies with bots filling numbersa new menu  system every time I log on it feels likeand so many micro transactions Everything just feels cluttered and complicated as soon as you log on with a very messy UIand Im pretty sure Barney the dinosaur ran past me at one point Its like its suddenly lost its own identity and copied Fortnitestealing other games recipes and jumbling it up into one messThis game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potentialpubg is released in 217 and dominates the market with new battle royal gameliterally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significantits suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community Cheatersnot refining core gameplayadding features noone wants or asks forthe most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this gameand really its a shame because under all this bullshit is some of the best gun play of any fps on the marketas someone who has over 2k hours in itthere is great potential here The real defining problemand it is the most significant problemis Blue Balls aka the brain dead developers They have never listened to their communityever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removedadding new mechanics to ensure safer rotationsa focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawnsmost of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patchyet the devs just double down on new maps5 skinsand patches that always break the gamebecause that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they havent changed in 1 years is the same thing youll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of shitAfter nearly 3 hours of playing timeim sorry to reportthat this game development is going into the completly wrong directionand the player base wont get splitwhile loosing your loyal playersbut banning players because of the numbers of reports the player gets   for me this results in almost consistent bans every two weeks because of my winratewhich is around 25 of all the games i play  makes a lot of funif you look forward to play some games and then you are banned  again and againweapon control is brilliantbut the way how PUBG is developing the game is just blatant and carelessyou messed up BIG TIMEWellmy first review on Steam goes to PUBG After 165 hrs of playing I loved this game and I hated this gamebut since 217 was playing continuously Cursing after getting killedscreaming after winninga lot of joyexcitementfrustration This is PUBG Sorry  it was PUBG After patch 72 this game is not for me anymore I am not pro playerI am just a guy who liked to play few matches in PUBG after hard day and enjoy everything I described above Why I am forced now to choose between play with mindless bots or pro squadmates I enjoyed this game mostly solo or with my friend as duo Playing this game nowI feel nothing I feel boreddisappointed Even after chicken dinnerseriously I feel like I reached to 8th season of Game of Thrones Im afraid this is the last time I uninstall this game All I have to do now is press F to pay respect the oldgood PUBG I will miss you my friendthanks for everythingPatch 72 released 522 has effectively KILLED this game  A short sighted money grab by the devs has conspired to inject loads of BOTS into virtually all BR game types ranked squads being the exception  With this movethe very core of what made PUBGs gameplay special has now been eviscerated  Getting a kill or a win used to be difficult and in turn rewarding  Now you can hop into a vehicle and proceed to run down enemy AI with impunity  Theyve also made terrible changes to the circleall but eliminating any intermission between circlesmaking it a running match from start to end  Ive always felt that the dev team had a certain amount of contempt for its player basebut this move confirms my suspicions   As of todaythe NA player base has dwindled down to 23K avg concurrent users  Expect that number to drop by at least  5 within the coming months  Its sad for me because this was my favorite game I can now safely attest that this game is in its death rattle  Save your money and look for the next best thing comingGIVE US BACK DAMN OPTION TO CHOOSE MAPS  Still not giving u positive review before u give us back map selection fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu 2hrs later same opinion i just have to add GIVE US THE DUO OPTION FOR NEW MAPS AND RANKED ARE U DUMB OR JUST STUPID  Why am i forced to play with 2 random people when i just want to have a nice couple of hrs of playtime with my buddy after work  This is BSImagine a restaurant that has five dishes to choose from These are called ErangelMiramarSanhokVikendi and Karakinsome taste like a smoothie made from toothpaste and fishthe restaurant decides you cant order any longer The dish you will get is urandomuthan the dish you like Obviously no real restaurant operates like thisthey would go broke in a week Yet the creators of Player Unknowns Battlegrounds think this is a wise strategic decisionIve encountered this game just like 999 of its playerbase didby watching Twitch streams and youtube videosI managed to talk few of my friends into playing itweve spent hundreds of hours on ita game which brought its developers millions if not 1 digit numbersand as any sane personyoud expect that it will be poured into further development and fixesrightand then proceed to blow it up and cave it in They had everythingmassive FREE ADVERTISEMENT NOTE FREE  NOT REQUIRED TO PAY FOR in a form of Twitch streamers and YouTube content creatorsinsane ACTIVE playerbasea product thats close to being 1 ready Everythingthey got everything And what do they doand instead of actually WORKING on itwhat do they do More platformsthey completely ignored that fact and started working on more crates and more ingame purchasesand considering Im actually rating a game here and not its thirsty developerIll focus on it nowthere are still PLENTY of nonconventional cheaters such as VPN abusers lifting ping on purpose to abuse the poor netcode and hit detection and Macro users AutoaimRecoil control Even though the numbers have droppedthis is still heavily affecting the game and user experiencegetting stuck in thin air while landing resulting in getting killedreloading sometimes doesnt reload your weapon at all resulting in getting killedconstant stuttering6 fail rate of reconnecting to the game in case of a disconnectbut ironically has least contentleast quality looting areaa MASSIVE LACK of vehicles considering the proportions of the map mostly resulting in you playing a running simulator for about 2 minutes and ending up getting killed by someone who had luck with the initial safe zone Even though the original map is betterthey still need to prevent bridge camping which makes the game impossible if you had bad luck with initial looting and safe zonemy character no longer stutters while runningproving my point this was indeed caused by the gameand not by my PC or internet connectionthere are way moreif you havent already bought this game DO NOT Save your money There are better alternatives if youre just taking up a new gameand theyre even free to play They dont have some of the mechanics PUBG hasand thats a shamebut at least theyre optimized Keep in mind that this game requires over the average PC to even be able to start the gamelet alone play it properlytheres still time to fix it
1,You were good sonreal goodmaybe even the bestYou never really stop playing TF2 You just take long breaks that last up to a few years before coming crawling backYou never really stop playing TF2 You just take long breaks that last up to a few years before coming crawling backYou dont quit the gamesince everyone loves this reviewhere it is in haiku formjungle what now the crate depression bot crisis no updates in yearsits sad to see valve neglect this amazing gameWellIll admitunlike other high profile folk that have more hours then me I have just under 2000 hours but have been playing this game for well over 10 years To be exact March 8th 200 as my badge saysbut I have been supporting this game since I first played The game I would always come back to and call homeover the years have made friendsenemiesservers Learnt different modesmetastyleslanguages I have been through multiple events likeThe Sniper vs Spy UpdateClassless Updatethe big 11th updates update no joke Solider vs DemomanScream FortressesChristmas updates You get the pointI cannot jump on a 118 ping New York serverlate at night waiting for the Americans to get back online in the eveningme and Banksy taking on 2Fort as Demoman to kill all soliders so that the Demoman could have his own weapon Spolier Solider wonwelcome to the Gunboats Then finding out TF2 came onto Mac and people that had itgot the ear budsthat sold wellI could go on and tell my war storiesbut that feeling when the family gets a new puppy and you get shut out as no one is interested in you anymore This is exactly whats happening with TF2 dev side I always check steam stats and there is always over 50k people playingalways top 10 on the chart but something is missingus loyal people that cherish this gamewe are the backbone to this beautiful creation You dont see Blizzard well not all the time not maintaining their beautiful creation and of course World of Warcraft is older then this Maybe because of the paid subscriptionbut I am sure that TF2 alone use to get more money as a free to play game at one point Jeeze I had to pay for TF2 over 10 years agofair playyou have a new game coming out whooptie doo Send all the cavalry towards that Yet instead to the people who grew up with TF2old players and new players People who have spent hundreds and even thousands of dollars for now a game which to me is dying Not the peoples faultbut your own selvesspamming good shot mateaim bottingauto spamming chat so no one can see whats written as a wall of blank appears and calling no when someone votes them a ban When there is 3 or more of them they win the no vote anywayso were forget about it the game the peoplewho truly love and support this gameto me at this dire momentis still rocking the steam chartsthis should be dealt with within a matter of days or weeks There are no new updates like the Solider vs Demoman The love for this game from youjust has vanisheddont expect me to dedicate my time or spend money on anything till this bot situation and other stupid stuff is dealt with and hopefully soon With new updates that sparkle in my eyes And a new bloody weapon for the Demoman as I deemed the solider win was unfairyes I do But at the moment with the bot situationother stupid stuff and the game at the moment being devless Nogo onto the community serversfind a modemapserver and enjoy I will give it a thumbs up but really should be a thumbs down at this point of the games lifebut play for funlearn who the characters are and the history about them I did and it got me 2000 hours10 years of play and a game I could call home There are also comics about the game to if you like to readAt the time of this reviewI have played this game for 112 hours which is the same year the Titanic sunk Unlike that shipthis game does not sinkreal goodmaybe even the bestive done it allRest in peace Rick MayI really appreciate this game for many reasonsbut the primary one is that it recognizes its own absurdity Not only thatbut it embraces it and builds upon itConstantly updatedYou never really stop playing TF2 You just take long breaks that last up to a few years before coming crawling backBot kicking simulatorEven tho the game is abandoned by valveit still has that weird magic in itwhere you meet all shorts of people  The tryhards that stomp casual pubsthe innocent newbies that have no idea whats happeningthe really funny people that will interact with youthe friendlies that betray you or protect youthe saltytoxic peopleIts a very unique experience playing this gameIts still the same game if you think about it except all the bots n cheaters apocalypse thats going on but overallsame good old tf2 that makes me laugheach class is unique enough by itself to make the game x10 intresting And wellthats the reason I have 3k hours on it and really damn good What makes this a good gameI WOULDNT BE SITTING HERE WITH 3558 HOURS REVIEWING IT NOW WOULD I engineer gamingit cured my testicluar cancerIn a land a longlong time agoTeam Fortress 2 would be a critically acclaimed first person shooter Boasting its colorful characters against the dreary palette of the Badlandsthis game offered to many a wonderful experience Later updates would add cosmeticsweaponsand a ton of other things to sink your teeth into Some of those updates are not as well viewed by the community as otherslike the addition of crazier and crazier hats In recent yearsthe community has felt somewhat negatively towards the team of developers and their updates for this game Thoughthere is something important to rememberand I doubt that you will soon see a day where these mercs arent defying laws of physicscommon senseand sometimes all laws in general You wont find many other games with a soviet in love with a 300 pound minigun that he just lugs around like its nothing Nor will you find a quickwittedcaffeinefueled Bostonian who dances around the battlefielddodging rockets and bullets like a madman This game is very outlandishand incredibly enjoyable Even after years and years of pushing a payload down a track to blow up the enemies people want to come backbecause although theres some basis and objectives for the game modesyou never play the same game twice Every match is a total surprise Even competitivelythe  classes and variety in what you can play withit will give you a new experience nearly every time you playthere are new faceshats to wearweapons to tryand a new experience to be had every single day
1,With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 D2 back on Battlenet the Blizzard launcherlet me give this perspectiveadvice for new playersspecifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2 New Lightwith a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughoutbut when it doesit breallyb shinesthe handling feels really goodand enemies really pop when you take them out Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday partiesthis is considerably less content than it used to beI would likethis should be easier than ever for most activities That saida huge majority of my playtime was done solo It can get tricky at times Darkness Zones in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revivesso solo players have a distinct disadvantage theredungeons currently only The Shattered ThronePit of Heresyand Prophecy and raids Last Wish from ForsakenGarden of Salvation from Shadowkeepand The Deep Stone Crypt from Beyond Light are best experienced with a teamso dont shy away from LFG groupfinder options like the Discordofficial appor any number of other sites just make sure to accurately describe your experienceleveland gear Tis only politeI really enjoy Gambit PvPvEreminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done rightjump into the occasional Strike PvEmatchmade fireteams running campaignlike missionsand have no interest in Crucible PvPits fine I guessbut Ive never liked PvP thats dependentat least in parton personal progressionor just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signpostslost sectorspatrol locationsor quest chainsand enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it eg raids or just mechanics in general What are random rolls Which do I keep that wed be happy to jump onto discord there are a bunch for PCjust check out the subreddit sidebar linked below and answer any and all questions you may haveservers crashing for less than an hour after launch cmon guysor whatever else has people triggered with a massive grain of salt The fact that a representative chunk of this game is now free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet unless youre crazy like me Any other questions about this game as a product What is weapon sunsetting Should I pay for DLC Is Eververse worth it should absolutely be researched elsewhere Especially now that infusion caps AKA sunsetting have been announced as being effectively rolled backwhich no longer makes older content irrelevant in newer endgame activities They also announced that the level cap increase season after season will be reduced by a significant margincutting down on the seasonal grind considerably Do your research before you buy older expansionsbut once both of these changes are in the gameI can wholeheartedly recommend D2 againfinish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome Remembereveryone is starting at the max light level from the most recent expansionwhich is great for playing with veterans without too much grindingbut means that you can miss out on the learning the ropes parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain As of Beyond Lightall of

lower seasonal power caps during Season 13per httpswwwbungienetenExploreDetailNews50124but really good And since its freeyou can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for

1,plays survivorDo you hate yourself Buy this game Youll learn to hate everyone else so much moreh1 While I generally love this gameI have a few warnings to those who are interested in buying it h1what are they doingwhat should you be doingnot teachingtheres some pretty nifty things h1which are gained through leveling ones account upand potentially has perks from DLC characters availablesome use Discord insteadas well as crouchingmost people who play survivor want full SWF crewscharactersperksincluding goofing offId recommend Probably about a 851 Have not pooped my pants due to this game but have come close a time or two ThanksGhost Faceh1which changes how survivors play Ex Zombies being added in the RE chapter in Player Test Build at the time of this updateunlocked through gameplayor redeemed via codes released by BHVRtheres an event to find Gnome Chompski once the exit gates are poweredwhich can be both good and bad Gens feel closer together but that also applies to hookslore The Archivesand various forms of ingame currencyso I can only assume that means killer queue times are better in the afternooneveningbut its better than it used to bebut also toxicityin higher ranksthe higher ranks tend to be very seriousself Its just a gamethe hit boxes need some improvement Lagframeperfect timingand other aspects all influence whether the hatchet hits your face or clips through your facebut if a Huntress nails me across the mapIm impressed with the shot and outraged on the killers behalf if it doesnt registersolid colorthen fadeout screen aura might be a good option for this It would preserve visual information without giving an unfair advantage to playersplayers with disabilities just wanna grind for bloodpoints and cry  like everyone else If your primary concern is giving players an unfair advantage please remember that accessibility options compensate for a setback so that people with disabilities have an even playing fieldbut the hit box issues can definitely make this game feel like a 21h1if they ever stumble their way into this reviewOut of all the reviews I wroteThis one is probably the most serious one I wroteYou dont wanna talk to them because theyre all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blahits rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this gameThe end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though Mostly just to say GG for Good GameJust ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave After seeing that they didnt make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG So I give this game a 81I actually had to take my time to write this because I didnt wanna swear in it so you didnt see nothing but censor hearts that steam likes to do So if you actually read this let me know by leaving a comment so I can be like someone read this peice of crap review yayDisclaimer I survivor mainnot for competitionso the DBD community doesnt really get to me If I get a bad killer that face campsoh well I die and move on to the next game If I get a good killer who finds me immediatelyhooks me bc I cant juke whoopsand then patrol camps which Im 1 OK withthen no biggie Next game pleaseit takes away from the fun of the game in my opinionIve also been called names by survivors who tell me to get gud Older players ruin it for newer players or players who dont put in 1s of hours Just relax and have fun with the game So what if you dont pip up  there is always the next game this game is crazy fun Dont let the saltiness of the community keep you from buying the game Grab ithave fun with itand ignore anyone who might give you a hard time  And dont fixate too much on the ranking process unless youre absurdly highly competitive for some reason also fine  just try not to let it push you into spouts of angerand even thenrecognize that there are jerks who play this gamelike any other gameand have fun while you competeI log on play a match get pissed log offrepeat this processthen hate my lifeProbably about half of my play time is dedicated to queuing for a matchDo you hate yourself Buy this game Youll learn to hate everyone else so much morevery difficult to determine if youre having fun or notPlaying as survivor killers are too OPits like a love hate relationshipI hate playing killer and dealing with the toxic communityThis game is pretty fun but like in the worst possible way I dont knowНе рекомендуюIm a Grandma whose son is a streamer on here  After watching him and his friends and community for the last few months I decided to try the game  Its actually pretty fun   Ive just played 5 games so farso I have a lot to learn but Im hanging in there  hahaI played DBD about 13 hours But one daymy account was initialized with an error message All the killers and survivorss level became Level 1 And all items and perks are disappeared I submitted a ticket to the DBD team about this matter with Steam ID64Cloud IDLeaderboard recordsevidence photos But they refused to compensate mesaying they couldnt find anything strange in their logs Ratherthey said that if you keep providing false informationyoull be punished strongly Thenthey closed the agenda obstinately I really loved this gamebut now I feel betrayed I would never recommend it There are so many bugs in this game and no compensation for the victim Even the crew doesnt have basic manners Dont buy this game Dont waste your money and life2294 ESTI will be closing this ticketI

out on the game and swapped to PC Sadly Ive come to find that PC players are just as ignored as console when it comes to BHVRyears agoCote had described the game as no longer theirsit now belonged to the community which at the time I thought was beautiful Years laterhoweverafter new hires like Ethanthe game has belittledignoredand straight up asked veterans to leaveand Mid Chapter 45 that completely ignore the complaints of the communityI finally had enough that I was going to submit individual bug tickets to them for every bug theyve been neglectingonly to find out theyve updated their website to hide bug tickets at the very bottom and shrunk the box to a 5th of the previous sizewhile having added tons of pictures and ads for the gameand top centering a small FAQ style technical support for things already fixedherds morons like sheep into defending their actively bad decisions by posting occasional memesand milks the game and its players by working minimally and at their own whim while we beg and plead for them to just acknowledge they heard what we have to say Im ashamed Ive spent so many years of my life believing in and supporting a game that left me behind years ago without me noticingNothing is meant to be fairand apparently by design  Mathieu Cote Game director On Dead by Daylightthe developers acknowledged it during one of their interviews You will be annoyed by everything By one of the most toxic communitiesby poor balance decisionscountless bugs Despite bringing the feeling of satisfaction sometimesyour mental state overall will be worse by the end of most play sessions You wont play this game because you like ityou will play it because youre addicted to the constant feeling of surpassing the irritation And the worst part is that you will feel rewarded because of the fact that you outplayed players who are there to mock you and verbally abuse you by the end of a game Its not healthy no matter how you look at it Even if you have thick skinits simply unenjoyable to waste your time on such people when you think about ityou need to put 1 hours for each character And there are so many of themit may take 1 hours to gain them all for freeif the upcoming changes are disliked by the communitythey will be rolled anyways since what can people dofind another Dead By Daylight Money were put into creation of the things players didnt likeget it or leave Ohwaityou wontcurrently the game has a few strong perks that the community takes and the other perks are not being used at all unless a player wants to feel less powerful for some reason And the killers often feel dull as well Instead of working on the previous perks and killers the developers prefer to make new perks and killers for the sake of pumping up moneywellstop spreading negativity This creates a false sense of positivity when the community is furious at BHVR at the momentdo not support this mess It looks fun on the outside but its a messBefore i played Dead

1,So I started playing Rust at 4pm yesterdaya bear ate me Then I watched two other players club each other to death with large stoneswhile completely nakedpenises penii dangling in the wind Having managed to slay a small pigI fashioned some clothes to cover my genitalsthen went exploringalso a shirt and a pair of boots Went about fashioning a small shelter out of some random crap laying around so I wouldnt have to sleep outdoors I could have chosen from one of the manymanyramshackle structures dotting the landscape But those may or may not belong tocontain other players Who may or may not be armed or clothed I just wanted to peacefully live aloneso I stuck to the wildernessasking what to do to fix my broken legsI didnt understand the game and I needed help A naked man came overtyped  i help in response to my pleasthen bashed my head in with a rock and presumably looted my corpsebut didnt have time to cook so I ate raw meat again Nope Instead of just starving to deathI vomitedthen starved to deathIve decided to sleep in a small shack I made myself in the mountains Dont dare risk making a firesomeone might see it at night and kill me for the tin of baked beans I got off a zombie I found wandering around a town that gave me radiation poisoning Oh yeahIll probably die slowly because of the radiationbut thats a problem for latermeI can probably safely say Im enjoying this gameI used to have a simple review for this gametitled Best Gameand I start to sell off my skin inventoryI feel it necessary to give this game what it has given to me over these past few yearstheres plenty of survival games out there But this game stands apart from the rest in ways I cant explain The amount of friends Ive madeenemies Ive madebases Ive madebases Ive destroyed The amount of times Ive been in massive PVP situationsdefended my base from a raidwoken up to be offlinedrebuilt The feeling of having AK less than an hour into wipe on vanillaof dancing with zergs as a soloor being part of a massive clan with friends The stories Ive created The stories WE createdyour teammatesand your enemies make day in and day out as you work together or compete to not only survivebut thriveand its the first game I ever truly got hooked on Im sure one daymaybe even only a month or two from nowIll be sucked right back in I love rust for the difficultyfor the challengefor the buildingfor the adrenaline pumping PVP Ive never experienced in any other gameand it doesnt give second chances But as you play more and moreand gain experiencelearn the games unique PVP and your way around the monuments Youll find yourself gradually getting better and better Whether it be buildinglike it was for meor PVPor even roleplayingyoull find your place in this worldLove this gamelost my gfmy jobmy dignity but at least i have my rockThis game ruined my life I dont know why I ever got into it I wish i never did it ruined my grades it ruined my sleep schedule it ruined me as a person and I want to kill myself now 11 game will keep playingI will be playing for weeks until I run out of food in my fridge and I die of playing RustI will be confiscating all of his Rust skins as this was written in has last willBefore i played Rusti had a small weeweeno friendsno girlfrienddepressionand absolutely no life These things havent changedbut the game is pretty good951got shotsaw it explodegot shotgot shotgot shot when i turned around951got shotsaw it explodegot shotgot shotgot shot when i turned around1 Watch some YouTube videosAfter around an hour and a half of bad spawnsscarce resourcesand shortlived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the mapI ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust I had initially spotted him pretty far awaybut I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other andupon the realization that neither of us were hostilewe both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace or the highest possible level of nonaggression that can exist in Rust I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metaland he gave me some food as a sign of good faith After nearly 3 minutes of searching and scavengingwe had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine bouldersand a lot of them I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bulletsthough I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow I had been running with my hatchet outso I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his directionattempting to scare him away When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined Just as we were moving on to the next boulderI heard the gunfire start I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friendand before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me It was at that moment that I remembered I hadnt even crafted a sleeping bag for the campas that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking I typed into the chatthanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines He simply wrote Sorry guys D This is the single problem that I have with games like this Why does it have to be shootonsight That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players which he really didnt considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area But of coursehe comes aroundsees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the gameand decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets Thento add even more of an insulthe adds an apology at the endas if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpectinghalfnakedunprepared playersthoughI do see a lot of potential in this gameand the good in the community does shine through every once in a while I just wish that people would realize that they dont need to go around killing players who havent had the chance to experience the game People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience6 men yelled racial slurs at me while i tried to break a rock 11 would play againDo you have a wife and kids Do you go to school Do you have a life Do you have anything to do outside of your pc If you answered yes to any of these questionsthis is not the game for youBefore buying Rustask yourself the following questionsregardless of group sizedo not buy this gamefulltimetoxic job then this game is for you For the low price of only 4 you too can be employedsee a guyThe key to enjoying RUST is simple Find the right server If you like desperately trying to avoid getting ghosted by groups of geared playerkillers while clawing your way into position as top dogtheres a server for that If you like building a great base and only fighting other players in specific areastheres a server for that If you like fighting off zombies while never having to deal with getting raided or offlinedtheres a server for that The graphics are intense and visceralyet also beautifulwhile the crafting and building are pretty intuitive once you get used to the system For your first run I would suggest a specifically newb friendly server until you get used to thingsotherwise it will just be lots of dying and rage quitting and you will miss an excellent survival shooterDo you like putting in hours of work just to be offline raided by a group of 15 Do you like being murdered by someone with an assault rifle while youre butt naked with nothing but a rock Do you like seeing toxic children arguing in chat 24 hours of the day WELLthis is the game for youbut youll have fun developing the worst trust issues of your life 11Most toxic game i have playedI love this gameI built a house around a guys house and made him my prisonerI fed him cans of tuna and cooked chicken when it was availableand some times I would drop in spare logs of woodwhen they were available The best part he talks to mekeeps telling me his clans going to raid my structure and save him I simply respond with ” It puts the lotion on its skinor it gets the hose again” and by hose I mean I dump charcoal on himI think my pet may need to eatYou have to play this game 247so get ready to lose everything in your lifeexcept for the virginitySo before i begin with this review  Yeah we all know Rust is a laggy piece of sht sometimesso i wont discuss this herewho listen to the communityand the community has almost full access to moddingbut that is not a main problem imobut that is life Not everyone you meet will be nice or help youbut if you are stubborn enough you will learn how to do it  manage itI murdered 3 people using a chainsaw and survived solely by eating my victims meat and stealing their fat to make fuel for my chainsaw I also collected their skulls
1,Ive been playing Path of Exile since 011 closed beta and its remarkable how far the game has come purely from crowd funding  The passion of the userbase is equally matched by its developers  Theyve shown throughout the years to constantly improve and tweak the game with regularly scheduled content additions  I still feel I dont know everything there is to know about this gameand that isnt changing any time soon  Path of Exile is an incredibly complex and rewarding game that is definitely worth your timethe other large appeal of this game is the endgame  Most ARPGs fail to offer incentive to continue to play your character after youve exhausted the content  Usually this just comes in the form of a easily attainable level cap or grinding the same final zone of the game at length  Insteadin POE you are given item drop instancesas described by the developersmagicrare or unique with higher rarity Maps yielding more items Using a Map item opens six portals to the areawhich can each only be used once Like most other items in Path of ExileMaps have mods that change their risks and rewards Map mods can affect the size or complexity of the levelmonster packsmonster properties or even alter characters while in the level Players can modify Maps themselves using their currency items For exampleyou can use an Orb of Transmutation to turn a normal Map into a magic Mapor use an Orb of Alteration to reroll its modswith room for countless variation in modifiers letting you push the limits of your character  Not all characters are equal  You will find that some characters that excell in early progression have difficulty in the endgame and visa versa  Each character Ive made has informed the next which is critical in a game that rewards experience and skillPOE offers alternative ARPG experiences in the form of daily race events which are time based leveling with unique modifiers that you wont see in the real game like Turbo Mode  Moreover some of these races have entirely unique content like Descent Champions or Endless Ledge which offer players the ability to win special art reskins of legendary items for the leagues of their choiceThis game is not very friendly to casual playersbeginners will have a relatively hard time grasping the games multiple mechanics that have never been in an ARPG previously However those who put in the time to learn the games basics will be rewarded with a tremendously addictive game with nearly infinite ways to play There are many reviews here explaining what the games features arebut on mine I would like to focus on what a newbie can expect when first playing I recommend reading this after having read one of the other reviewsthat will do a better overview of what the actual game features aresuch as going full evasionenergy shield gear without proper understanding of how ES worksor building a full glass cannon characterwhich is not a good idea even in a nonhardcore leagueand building your character as you go is rarely a good idea This is something that players learn over timeand meanwhile a good way to decide what to play is to find a fun skill ingameand then look up a build for it on the forums link provided below Remember that almost anything can work in this gamewith proper planningin its placecurrency items Currency items are the items that are used for buying and selling in PoEbut they have an added value in the effects that they can have when used on items For example An orb of alchemy can turn a white item item with no statsinto a rare item with random stats All the currency in PoE has a different useand some are rarer than othersadding value to them I will add a link in my list of links at the end of this reviewguide where you can trade itemsand trade one currency for another You can also see the value of each currency therethe gem system has many of them In PoEskill gems can level like your characterhowever there are reasons to consider not leveling them For examplethe Cast when damage taken gemwhichcauses skills linked to it to be automatically casted when you take a specific amount of damagesometimes should not be leveledbecause leveling it increases the amount of damage you need to take in order for the skills to triggerwhich can lead to skills not triggering as often as youd like Another example is the clarity gemthat gives you a mana regen aura Leveling it increases the amount of mana reservedwhich can be undesirable It is recommended that you research what changes with each level up for your gems Leveling gems also increases the level and stat requirementso if for whatever reason you lose some of an attributeall of a sudden you will not be able to use that gem anymore until you get moreordue to the increased level requirementyou will not be able to equip it on another character until theyre higher levelgear in Path of Exile will rarely be equippable as soon as you get it Those gloves you just got have amazing statsbut the sockets arent the right coloror arent linked Which means you have to craft on them crafting is the act of spending currency to modify an itemsuch as linking sockets with orb of fusing Many times as a new player have I gotten an upgradebut screwed myself over by spending all my currency trying to craft on itor on something elseand not ending up with the result I desiredresulting in the item being put in the stash until I had more currency to use on the item Some management is requiredPoE is a great gameone of my favorite gamesand once you get into ityou can expect to be playing it for a really long time The relatively high barrier of entry might intimidate you as a new playerbut if you dont mind doing some research of game mechanicsfew games will provide the gameplay that PoE providesyour best friend when playing this game Almost any question about the game is answered here  urlwhere you can trade with other players urlthlink is for witch but at the top there are links for other classesurlthth Might be outdated depending on when youre reading this th trso you can decide where to spend your points before even starting your playthrough urlthIf you dont have a phone this game is for youAt the time of writing this review I have 498 hours put into this gamebut find Diablo 3 underwhelming and the end game too boring and simplefarmingtradingtheorycraftingetcincluding a major expansion every yearwith the exception of some qualityoflife upgradeswhich are not necessary in order to enjoy and play the gamewhere you can mixandmatch between skill gems the unique items with special and sometimes buildenabling statsand the end game map system all contribute to a game that takes something simple and turns it very interestingI cannot recommend this game enough I have played WoWDiabloLoLCSHSHotSSCand many other games for countless hoursbut no game has ever kept me interested for the amount of time that Path of Exile has  it just keeps getting betterand the developers communicate a lot with the community in order to continue to improve the gamewaitits freeMost expensive game on Steam3 kidsand a demanding job On any day if I can do  hours of uninterrupted gamingI’m in blissyet interestingly unique and differentcomplexityand grind Yet it has flexibility and freedom to truly do whatever I wantI like to take a break from PoE every now and then and play a couple hours of lifeSimply the most indepth HacknSlash out there and the best according to me Character customization is topnotch and replayability is huge I have a little bit over 1k hours played on it did not link the game to my steam account immediately and I still  have many things to discover Howeverit is a hardcore game less accessible than Diablo 3 or others gamesalmost every build has drawbacks and strengthOne of the best and true to form Free to Play games currerntly available10 item storage upgrades Neither of which is an obvious Pay to Winin no wayrestricted to any particular role or build with each starting classlv70without you having to register or post themyourself The public market is fairly well establishedbut this seems to be less of a problem as time matches onyeahI would say that this game is plenty of fun to play and their business model is one of the most generous availablethen give Path of Exile a try Chances areyou will not be disappointedGot leaped by Goatsrhoad from Rhoassmashed by Vaaltouched by the Godawaken by a Nightmare and lost in the Labyrinthalmost every build has drawbacks and strengthh1TLDR Go play the campaignits great h1this will be a long reviewbut if you are a Single Player personor coop player at mostthat wants to try Path of ExilePoE for the first timethen this review is for youI always liked ARPGsand as it happens to all of usPath of Exile shadow looms large over the genre and your curiosity eventually gets picked up by it You probably have the same fears as mesurely its designed in a way to force you to pay to complete the campaignithis is another No You can complete its lengthy 10 act campaign without spending a single coin in the game You even can complete it with all the characters and not pay a single dime And if you dont want to play with other people you arent forced at any time to do so The microtransactions are mostly cosmeticsand extra space for the stash isnt really necessary for the campaignis the campaign that long I have to dedicate my life to the game i Well here is where it gets complicateddo all the sidequests and hear all the dialogues Its structured in a way to avoid the classic win the game 3 times in NormalNightmare and Hell difficulties so that here the difficulty escalates as you progress through all the 10 acts So if you want to play casually just once a week to unwind and kill some monsters its great They really nailed how to sidestep the repeated playthroughs of the genre Kudos to the teamwhat about that crazy skill tree I dont want to read a wiki or a guideI just want to play ithats why it seems daunting Imagine if Diablo  dropped all the skills of the 3 trees of each character in one screen PoEs skill tree is the result At first just focus on the path closest to your starting point varies depending each class Thenwhen you are comfortable with the gameyoull start to see other ramifications and possibilities So feel free to experiment as you level uptry crazy combinations and see if it fits your playstylethe great thing about it is that you can do some pretty varied builds with it Active skills are another matter that I cant fit here due to the max char count of steam reviewsyesbut you have 400 hours what did you do after winning the campaign iPoEs bEndgameb Which is basically a gigantic map with something like 150 levels connected between them What I like about its that it has a clear goal with its own story related to it Its not just killing mobs to get better gearand so onwhere you feel like the horse constantly chasing the carrot Here you have to get better gear to kill the finals bosses of the game Previouslythese were two ancient beings that created the Atlas or something like that and always appeared from time to time randomly and gave the end game some really interesting backstory NowPoE being a Game as Service kind of gamethings get changed up Sadly the Atlas changed and I dont find it as interesting as in the past with the new bosses Conquerors of the Atlas  I think its possible to access the old bosses but it requires doing something special and its not integrated into the Atlas like the current bosses But it still retains interesting aspects and mechanics that you should try all the same Its quite uniquehalf the Atlas ie Most people just look up a guidecopy a build from said guideand even get the items needed for the build trading them with other playersso no lootingjust farming currency Yeah I knowkids these days right I personally dont get any fun from equipping a player in an ARPG by farming currency and trading instead of earning your loot killing difficult bosses Or by copying someone elses character You can play like me and ignore the social aspectand without reading any build guides But the endgame doesnt seem designed for that as I said before since the Atlas becomes quite difficult You will need hours upon hours to reach a good understanding of the mechanicsits nice to discover the intricacies of itbut the game may burn you out before you master it The good part of PoE being a Game as Service is that there is always new content as an excuse for you to go back and try a new characterwhats that igoing with a new one with each league isnt a bad idea But again forget challengesthey are only for the hardcore audience that complete everything in two weeks probably less If PoE isnt your only game or hobby after workthen the 3 months space may be too littleits good It has some highs Some parts I recommend hearingreading notes are the Labirynth backstory a dungeon you have to complete without dying to earn points and make a Specialization for you character and Daressos story with the levels in the Colosseum Also Kitavas story in the last act as you learn its origin is good But my favorite is the Labyrinth backstory of why it was created and all the rest that I wont spoil hereI do recommend a quick check of the wiki for the different horadric cube formulas so you know what to put in the merchant window to obtain certain currenciesIve been a Diablo fan pretty much my entire gaming life  One of my earliest childhood gaming memories was saving up my allowance to buy Diablo   I played D for yearsI preordered the collectors edition of Diablo 3 and stayed up all night on launch night to play itand since then Ive put thousands upon thousands of hours into playing it  Why am I talking about Diablo 3 in a PoE reviewtrying to find a new game to catch my interestand I decided to finally try PoE  Now I honestly think I might never play Diablo 3 again  PoE is a true spiritual successor to Diablo   Diablo 3 went in a new directionmaking the game more casual and spectaclefocusedand dropping some of the more complex and esoteric RPG mechanics  I liked thisand I certainly dont think it was a mistake for Diablo 3and Diablo s clunkier but more complex and deep styleall of which are used for trading and for crafting in a variety of different ways  Theres no standard classesinstead PoEs version of classes mostly determine where you start on the enormous and daunting passive treeand youre rewarded with an incredibly deep game with a much more fleshedout endgame compared to Diablo 3and nearly infinite build complexityPoE is fundamentally about the classic grindy gameplay loop of kill monsters to acquire gear to increase your power so you can kill higher level monsters to get more gear to increase your power level more etc etc etc  The trick to these games is to have a wide variety of different builds and playstyles so people can keep grinding without feeling bored  PoE delivers this in spadesAscendancy classes that you unlock via ingame challenge puzzle levelsand other decisions you make in the campaign that effect your character allow for an insane level of complexitywithout even addressing the gear  Want to be a spellcasterbut who focuses almost exclusively on melee attacks  You can do that  Want to be a physical brute that focuses on summoning minions  You can do that too  Just about any combination you can imagine can be madethough obviously theres no guarantee itll be any goodand the actual gear itself with all the incredibly deep and complex crafting mechanicsand you can make a truly mindboggling array of different characters  Coming from Diablo 3 where theres usually about a dozen or maybe two dozen good builds in any given seasonI was flabbergasted by PoE where you can easily find hundreds if not more  The difficulty isnt in finding a decent buildits in picking one amongst so many optionswhich is a doubleedged sword  On one hand its really nice to be able to skip the RNG and just trade for the particular item you want  I love being able to start a new altand use currency farmed from my previous characters to quickly just purchase everything my new character needs  That being saidsome rarer items will be almost impossible to affordespecially at the start  This means that some builds will simply be too expensive for you to playwhich is something that Diablo 3 doesnt have  Though the more you play the more you makeso eventually everything becomes affordable enoughbut dont let that fool you  You WILL be pressured into paying  The game MOSTLY sells cosmetics which are absurdly priced dozens of dollars for a single cosmetic itemyikesbut the real kicker is that they sell stash space  You start with an amplebut limited stash  Youll quickly find that the game floods you with huge quantities of lootand before long even just the stuff you really want to keep will start piling up in your stash  By the time you get to the end of the campaignyoull be feeling quite a lot of pressure to buy certain stash tabs just for the quality of life  But lets talk for a second about the campaignin a good way  Your first time throughitll probably take 0 hours of gameplay to complete  By the time youve done it a few timesyou can power through it in a half dozen hours or soless if youre really hardcorebut youll always need to do it because  it gives a lot of rewards that your character needs  Like Diablo the level cap is 100 but as you get into the 90s it becomes a truly insane grindso most people dont even bother attempting to get to level 100let alone reach it  Past a certain point you start losing experience when you dieand at the higher levels you lose so much that even a single death can cost you hours worth of farming to make back the deficitto go back to the microtransactionsyoull feel pressured to spend 0 or so around the time youre finishing your first campaign  While I dont like being pressured to spendespecially in such a forceful wayit doesnt feel totally unfair to spend 0 or 30 on a game that youve already spent 030 hours playing  And once youve spent anywhere from 3060 on the various stash tabsyou should have more than enough space for just about anythingbut if you like ARPGs like Diabloyou should absolutely give it a try  Theres a significant learning hurdle at the startbut once youre over it the game offers nearly endless replayability and a really enjoyable power progression and endgame that will keep you coming back3 Scoops of DiabloIf you like action roleplaying game ARPG but have not played this game yetyou must Grinding Gear Gamesan indie gaming company with their entirely freetoplay gamehave created one of the most complexindepth and innovative ARPG in the gaming industrythis game has one of the most fair and ethical business model you could ever see in the freetoplay market Absolutely nothing you can get with real money gives you advantage over other players This encourage players to support the game because they actually want to donate for the developing and its developers and not because they are forced to progresscartoonish RPGs The

builds and other players likes to break the rules and metas to come with insane mechanics The developers areas explainedthe most ethical and responsive gaming company you could find out there considering the success of their game Reason to be disclosed they are hardcore gamers creating a game after allwhat would be better than thatIm 64 and if I can play this game and enjoy it anybody can The reason you are seeing 50 higher player numbers is that us players have lost faith in Blizzard and are all hailing the new ARPG leaders90 of the time I have no idea wtf Im doingFree to playfree to own There are microtransactions that keep Grinding Gear Games up and runningbut they are only cosmetic and stash related There is no pay to win Speaking of winningthere is a new ladder season every 3 monthsand ladder characters are automatically transferred to the standard league at the end of the seasonso you never lose your characters Every new ladder season comes with a twista special subplot that changes every season The current seasons SeptOctNov 018 speciality is called Delvewhere you can mine stuff underground and win great rewardsIve spent about as much money on this game as I would have on a similar nonFP RPG and I still feel guilty I feel like Ive ripped off the hardworking developers and artists who put this game together I never needed to buy anything I never needed to pay one red cent There is no mechanical advantage to paying for the kickass cosmetic changes But if Im ever flush with cash Ill be sinking more coin into Path of Exile Simply because I dont feel like Ive paid enough for this awesome gamegiven so freelyThe absolute successor to Diablo  Any fan of the ARPG genre will greatly enjoy Path of ExileIf Im being honestI actually hate this game I personally find it a boringtime consuming adventureI can personally attest to its uniqueness Its skill system is complex andlike I saidcan take years off your life if you let it It seems as though the developers really put care into the game and I love seeing that in the gaming industryyou should play this gamethis isnt it I understand its a more hardcore game where time and effort is rewarded and laziness isntthe once hardcore playerturned casual
0,Ive played this game on PC and Android and enjoyed it until the cheating and hacking just COMPLETELY RUINED my experience As I am typing this reviewI just finished a 30 player killing spree in the Bicheon Valley 3F on 1 single Darksteel vein of yellow quality Nobody fought back They kept teleporting instantly back INSIDE the vein making targeting extremely hard So after I killed every teleport bot and sent them to townI started mining darksteel to continue upgrading my gear and while I was miningon peacefull3 bots instantly teleported inside the vein one of them even was red PK statusso TPs are legit unavailable to them and somehow cancelled my mining process mid swing no attacks as I dont have retailate set to onI get interrupted again by the teleporter botshere I am complete red statusmy XP gain nerfed by 70can no longer fast travel and to regain my clear PK status I have to kill approximately 7500 monsters of level 5 of my own Pluseverytime I dieI drop a good chunk of my items on the groundnobody is miningnobody is looking at itkilling them makes no difference than to penalize you as they magically can take ownership of the vein by bugging your game client the mine button becomes also unresponsiveyou have to walk 5m then come back to be able to reclaim it after killing themvery inefficient but they areyou need boatloads of quantities to upgrade and craft better gear Gear that can fail the upgrade process Gear that can catastrophically fail the crafting process making you lose said gear on top of currencies It is a korean MMO at heartso there is real grind in this gameas long as you arent facing the other type of cheaters  they use speed and small distance teleport hacksno cooldown on abilitiesno mana consumption They basically can do 5x your damage per second due to that while being extremely hard to hit or catch if they are running faster than the game design intendedthe developer has closed a  good chunk of European and Asian serverswithout merging them Straight out closing and deleting everything on them Ive had a couple of characters on the older EU servers before I decided to stick to EU23they are all gone Amazing Imagine having also paid stuff for those characters in the cash shop The economy of those servers was so unbalanced that they decided to delete everythingauction house is also deadthere are only sellers Minimum price is 10gold per itemstack Ive put up all my blue materials and gear at the lowest possible price Nothing sold in a week The catch you can only buy and sell on the auction house with gold  the hard currency So somebody has to purchase ingame money to be able to buy stuff from other players to begin the trading chains It aint happening as people buy gold from 3rd party sites and get banned cheaper than what the developer is offering Others just bot and cheat Funnyas the game has official bot embedded into it auto combat and gatheringbut on hard content like dungeons and raids you have to assume some manual control in order to not die every minute  and still people make better botseven if you wanna play this game as a legit MMO with an Android UI and attrocious control scheme I still cant recommend it for endgame as it will take you years to reach level 110 the max level and be the only player on the serverstill with crap gearit has officially kill any kind of drive to force myself to enjoy this gameI will give you that Nothing kept me more engaged since the age of PvP browser games Its 3 AM in the morningtomorow I gotta wake up for workI just came home from a wedding and Im legit tired and sleepybut I needed to finish up this review and stop youthe readerfor wasting tens or hundreds of hours on this game in case it clicks with you Dont Better get a singleplayer RPG or play anything elseThis game has a lot of potential but it is overrun with bots and there is nothing being done about it  Bots have been an issue from the start of the game and all it would take is a few minutes of active attention on each server per day to identify them and ban them  Even if you dont get them all the first day the numbers will dwindle quickly  Normally you could just play around the bots but these bots are actually taking up the most valuable resource in the game  This resource can either be minedreceived as a quest rewardor purchased  The resource is used in over 90 of all craftingenchantingupgrading your character in anywayetc  The bots are able to teleportand knock you off of the resource without actually damaging you  This wouldnt even be ok if they did damge you so that you can kill them and get your resource backbecause there are so many bots they are programed to have one knock you off and another take the resource that way you cant kill the one who got your resource  Even if you do kill themthey can resurrect and teleport back to the node in seconds where it should take them several minutes to get back on auto run  Another issue is that pvp is so heavily punished in this game that if you kill a bot that was there just to take your resource and not damage youthen you end up suffering more because you can no longer gain xp at full value  Thats rightthe pvp penalty effects your growth as a player which is another thing the bots dont care about as they are just after the resource  Once you gain negative propensity because of killing a non hostile bot you are then freely targeted by other players while you try to get rid of the negative propensity  The penalty for killing one none hostile bot is 999 propensity which means you need to kill 00 monsters within 5 levels of you to get back to getting full xp againin game purchased based on luck  This means you spend real life money to have a chance at getting something useful  You would be better off burning your moneyat least then you could watch the flames and be warm in the coming winter  The gambling aspect of this game needs to seriously be addressed as you dont even end up with anything in the long run just ones and zeros turned into pixels that you cant eat or pay your rent with  Even if you want to try the game as free to playdont bother because the pay to win players will always be able to keep you down  There is no hard work overcomes paid for advanceswho are in the top guild of each serverleft because that is all who will play it  Dont waste your time exploring when there are better games out there that actually care about the quality of the game play instead of making moneyFun grinding game on the go and actually had fun playing despite the bots and hackers present on the servershackers and NEVER and I mean NEVER purchase anything from their ingame store with real world money otherwise you will labeled a cheater and get banned 10 years or longerBraindead gameplay this if you dont know what to do with your lifethere is still gb on your hard drive on steamappscommon folderThis is a mobile game fullstop Auto combat Auto pathing Auto questing Tons of afk activities Absolute  tons of things to level upand everytime you do theres a  icon for you to click to collect some sort of rewards Cash shop is filled with timelimited items to create a sense of FOMOand the items themselves are mostly paytoadvanceand thus Im judging this as a PC title UI is straight up ported from mobile version without any adjustments There is no aspectrationo FPS settingsno Vsyncno nothing Every bells and whistles youd expect from a PC title simply isnt hereforgettable soundtracksmeh story idk whether this is translation issuebut still Its meh Combat animation is pretty nicebut there is no depth to it whatsoever You get 6 skill slots to spam them over and over without the need for any variationsand let MP potion autouse take care of the restlots of issuesBS game and NO you will never get rich with this game even with NFTStraight forward review and detailed Play 2 earn mechanics after 110hrs of gameplaythey removed the play2earn mechanics conversion on steam which is stupid If youre only playing for the play2earn mechanicsbetter have a stand alone pc version or mobile one cause you cant convert in steam Though you can still farmNAEUSA servers and no you cant switch serversread more if you are interested on how the play 2 earn workslike craftingenchantingenhancing etc You can farm darksteel in multiple ways like auto questing dailies or auto farming000 darksteel a day Thats minimum from auto farming dailies which takes maybe around 12hrs depending on the player farming the mobs as it gets crowded at times But if your game is only running in the background why not right You can also get darksteel from main quests and other stuff You can also auto mine darksteel but I dont recommend that even on level 0 especially on lower levels at mobs can AOE you while mining as theres too much miners on a single map and there are no other channels for that map Alsoyou only get around 2530 darksteel per 10 seconds if you have not upgraded your mine in your conquest You can increase your mining capability by upgrading stuff and equipping pets Higher levels offer higher darksteel daily farming000 darksteel  1 Draco coinbut even as a long time mobile playerthere is too much cons for me to properly recommend this game Especially the typical gacha whale promoting multiple server they have Basicallymore serversmore whales will feel dominant and not be defeated by the other bigger whales on the other server Thats the whole point for multiple server mobile games More whales  More money for themthen this game might be for youCustomer support is simply non existent I got banned for a refund that I never asked for and my tickets are ignoredas well as my Discord messages Not worth the headacheThis game is a waste of time Banned my account with the reason of using 3rd party appDont bother with this chinese garbage gameheavily pay to win and is a mobile game port with auto attack and auto pathingThis game had potential A lot of itbut blockchain mining ruined it entirely Although grantedbecause it is a blockchain mining gameit has fulfilled its purpose and gone beyond with beautiful graphicsacceptable voice acting and a decent plot for a RPGI tried it because I wanted a new MMO that I could leave in the background while I worked It wasnt about the crypto Neither was it the case when I left I came back to the game a few months after they mass banned the hackers and accounts that violated the rules to see what has changed and if the game is fairer nowits still fecking shitbpeople like to assert dominance over another country to prove theyre more superior than the rest of the world Because honestly whyI dont knowNA is dominated by Spanish languageEU is dominated by Russian languageAsia is dominated by ChineseThai and Tagalog languages The translation feature that comes with the game is absolutely useless when modern slang or abbreviations are used in chatalthough acceptable to an extent for an idle MMOthe materials required are hard to come by and expensive to buy You can spend a lot of money on itand the drop chance is probably still just as shitthe game punishes a players progress harder by making equipment and stat upgrades difficult to achieve due to the lack of material drop or the fact you need the blockchain minting currency to actually upgrade or craft anything that helps you progress further in the gamepoint 7 has its pros and cons as it balances the game and the draco coin marketbut adding onto the fact that there are too many bots and miners who want quick money for little effortthis game is practically hard to progress by itself Its probably better in servers that are newer and has less people Otherwiseas a veteran player who has been in the first few servers the game ever came withit is no longer enjoyable to play leisurelyor even if you are here for the blockchain miningI would not recommend the game Howeveryou could find joy in this game if you have an aggressive personality and like to intimidate other players so you can do the blockchain mining yourself Or if you can understand the players spoken language to begin with To each their owncheersCant even solve botting problem Almost 75 of player base of this shit game are bots from china winnie the pooh kingdomCryptoNFT garbagebut at least its got jiggly boobsThis game is not fix yetthey keep banning Legit player for no reason i should rank this from 5star to zero starThe only reason anyone would play this because it has cryptoblockchain in itbut this is your typical auto RPG game where you literally just press and AFKnothing specialif you love real RPG then this is not the game for youbut ill give credit that visually its quite goodThe Chinese Government approves this gameSocial credit score 99Braindead gameplay this if you dont know what to do with your lifethere is still gb on your hard drive on steamappscommon folder

1,h1My Impressionh1continually evolving gamebut at its heartit will always remain iSpace Ninjas with Magici and weapons tons of weaponsbut lets make it short heredue to the steam restriction on the character limit for reviewsI will be putting the following points into a Guideone which will entertain you for quite some timecombined with all the character questsgo ahead and finish this off with my personal verdict and then form your own opinionwhere you will lack a guiding hand this game will suck you inyou will become lost in space and time will just fly bybut it is steadily being worked on and being improvedthe devs neither lack creativity nor daringto try new thingsso just give it some time and see what it can give you backI would be grateful for a thumbs upif you didnt like ityou can give me a thumbs down but I would be glad to hear your opinion on what you didnt likeThis story requires a bit of setupa friend of mine whom Id known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder called a Grandmaster ingame called Warframe A third person cooperative shooter with elements of Phantasy Star OnlineDiablo loot runsprocedurally generated levelsand more content being added all the time The game was difficult to startas there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers Running along walls Sliding down ziplines SoonI was completely hooked my friend and I were playing late into the nighttrying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weaponor trying to beat our best time on the Survival missions  where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down Over the yearthere were many great victorieshair raising last second escapesand new friends joining our little group Many hours were spent joking around with each other on Skypecracking jokesblasting weird songs at each otherand coming up with our own stupid little catchphrasesnew Warframesnew weaponsand new combat controls The game still has its original stylebut its so much improved Last weekour four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions The only thing that made us stop was getting tiredmy friend who invited me to the game a year ago didnt show up that night I found out on Wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition The shock of it is still hitting us hard The friendships that we had formed through the gamegone in an instant It hardly feels real I keep expecting him to log in and be thereready to do another defense missionand its difficult to accept that well be going it alone nowthe company that makes the gameand asked if there was anything we could do They dedicated their 11202014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air Their reactions were heartfelt and touching They really do listen to and react to the communityand form a clan or join one just because many items are clanonlyI recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community They constantly improve it and add new contentitemsand weapons There is a storyline that is unfolding The voice acting is delightful You could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of Warframes and weapons you can ownor buying things that you cant wait forDigital Extremes And rest in peaceWoxitIf youre here at the crossroads asking yourself Destiny 2 or Warframe  then perhaps this review might clear a few things up for youI mean I grinded that game so hard for 4 monthsachieved absolutely everything possibleobtained everything and then never touched it again Dont get me wrongI LOVED those 4 months But this isnt a review about Destinybut rather about Warframe And man is it a good gamethere certainly isnt  the type of handholding that Bungie provide you with in Destiny Whilst this hand holding can seem helpful at the startit soon turns into a glass ceiling Forcing you to go in a particular direction or playstyle  there is non of this in Warframeyou unlock one planet move onto a next and so onbut warframe really lets you choose how you tackle this The weapon system in Warframe is a prime example of how open it is You can pick a starter gunand because of 100s of mods availablethis starter weapon can still kick a in mid to end game Every Primarysecondary and melee weapon feels unique and there are so many ways to alter these weapons Want a machine gun that sets enemies alight No problemjust add a Fire Mod Want a bow that fires 2 arrows instead of 1 No problemadd a multishot mod Want both of those No problemadd both modswait till you try the warframes There are about 0 or so different warframes basically characters and each has 4 unique abilities Each warframe is suited to a particular purpose You like to control the sea and summon a Kraken to throw enemies about Hydroids your guy You like to set every enemy on fire and watch the world burn Embers who youre after Want to heal the rest of your teammates and be the lifeline of the team Trinity is here And guess what Yeppyou can mod these just like you mod the weapons Want more shield on your tanky Rhino warframe No problemwe got that Want more energy to keep using your abilities Eyyy yepp that too And thats just 2 examples out of hundreds4 war wolvessome catfox breed and an epic looking alien bull All of which have their unique abilities and purpose And yes you guessed it You can also mod themyou can add armor piecesyou can add sigils tattoo type thingsyou can add capesyou can change helmet style and you can change the colour of every single one of these pieces and aspects The same goes for your companions and weapons Also you can customise the colour and skin of your shipyou can even change the colour of the walls inside your ship Theres ALOT to customise in this gameits quite impressivethe community This is perhaps one of the nicest and most pleasant social aspects of Warframe The community is so closekind and caring People have always helped me and some even gave me free stuff This really is unique in an online game and boy is it nice to seeI came to Warframe to keep me occupied and now Im hooked I STRONGLY recommend you try Warframeyou will not be disappointed Great work DEfeedback and comments Ill do my best to answer a few valid points that Ive seen come up in the past week or in the commentsI dont think the term overpowered can be used here I think certain Warframes are more USEFUL than othersbut then again that will entirely depend on what mission or purpose you are doing For example Sure I can run through a difficult Spy mission with Ember an incredibly offensive fire based Warframe but I will have an easier and smoother time tackling it with Ash a stealthysilentsingle target based Warframeweapon or even companion is only as powerful as the mods you put on it Meaning that you can completely transform a warframe from something meh to something godly just by using the right modsand good ones too But rememberthe better the modsthe harder they are to find  more expensive they are to buy with platbut WoW is the one I can think of right now  World of Warcraft is a longrunning game and like in Warframethe often beginner areas which were created right at the start of the game look barren and terrible This is somewhat true about the first few planets in Warframecertain areas at the start look lifeless and without depth BUT as you progressthe planets become more detailed and graphically nicerrecently DE just remastered Earth the first planet and it looks MUCH nicer So be patientDE definitely know that certain areas look crud and they are working on it Im sure I expect more planets will get a makeover just like Earth in the near futurePlains of Eidolon the newestsemiopen world area is not entirely what we expected but think of this This is the first time DE have attempted anything like itthey clearly said prior to the release that they were expecting feedback and will continue to add more content to PoE They are a small studio and dont necessarily have the resources that large studios like Blizzard or Activision might have Give them timegive them feedback and be patient I am almost certain that in the coming weeks DE will be adding more content and tweaking the existing stuff to make it smooth and enjoyablePlains of Eidolon is not meant to be the bulk of the gamethere are still many other planets and things to do Its just a new area in an existing planet Everyone chill and give DE some room to breathe and work things outthey have in the past and they will do so now tooThere are very few games that have held my attention for 1000 hours over the yearsthis is one of them I created an account back when the game was still in Alpha late 2012back then it was was just a simple module with some enemies to kill with a handful of warframes to choose from Even then though it showed promise Over time they have added tons of contentnew warframesweapons galorenew planetsmission typesArchwing fly in spaceeventsclan dojos and foundryplayer to player trading systemsyndicates to joinplayer HUBs relay stationsPVP8 player Raid etc etc If you enjoy third person shooters4 player cooppvpraidingRPGs andor ninjas in space lol this game is a dream come true then for you Being that it is free to play there is literally nothing to lose checking it outit is surprising the amount of variety in the game When you find something you like it is a rewarding feeling and you will too it is just a matter of time Also decent customization for your warframesweaponsSentinels companionKubrows dog companionLiset your shipwith a multitude of color choicesskins and attachmentsthey all have a total of 4 Some are better at being tankydpssneaking cloakingsolo playhealersAOE damagedefense etc There is a Warframe for every situation it seems You can also make your own builds for each frame based on what mods you have you attain them while playing missions they are dropped by enemies For example Continuity mod allows for longer power duration timewhen you ability is activated More ammodamage mods etc etc sooooo many Making building your perfect Warframeweapons very flexible and enjoyable You have the opportunity to have a Primarysecondary and melee weapon With the opportunity to make your own builds for everything here adds to the games replayability imo Same goes for sentinels and kubrow companions they all have their own set of modsespecially made for themespecially for newer players That is to be expected though being that it is an MMOish experience Especially to gather enough resources and credits to craft your items Well worth it though if you have the time to invest Sometimes they seem to nerf warframes and weapons for no reason at all and then they rework it again and fix it NerfUnnerf is the nature of free to play MMO ish kind of games Constant balance tweaking This is not an instant gratification game eitherthe game gets better the more you play it You can also purchase items with real money from the in game marketit is bNOTb necessary though Most things can be attained just playing the game gathering resources and crafting them accordingly Exceptof course vanity itemsskinsunique color palettes and limited time only items that have been available over the course of the gamehalloweenSt Patricks day etc Free weapons toothey seem to do somethings special on the games anniversary every year The developer also listens to community feedback and designs and have added many things based on that Which is always a plus The game can also get repetitive at timesbut with the amount of content in game now that is harder to happen You just have to mix it up from time to time and try new things within the gamebut what game truly is right There is a lot to enjoy here and unique setting and premise to the gamedefinitely sets itself apart from the competitionbut at its current state I give this game a 4 stars  ★ ★ ★ ★  out of 5Firstgood things about Warframequests and environments are fully disclosed to you on their due time That being saidI HAVE spent money on this Why Cosmetics of course Fashion is endgame you knowjust what is Warframe Warframe is a mostly PVE third person shooter action game with parkour elements flawlessly integrated into the gameplay You have seen games do parkour before of coursebut these are space ninjas were talking aboutwhich means you can basically fly around the stage at high speed while letting loose a torrent of bulletsrockets andor highenergy plasmaor just take out your trusty swordhammerfists and cripple anything in your pathrobotsaliensyou name it Yesthere are bossesand they can and will kick your buttand I mean HUNDREDS of weapons to choose from Each of them unique in its own wayand deeply customizable to suit your needs andor taste You can carry three of them at a time A primary weapon bowrifleetca secondary weapon pistolthrowing knivesand other thingsand of course a melee weaponyou can always tear through the game solobutfor the best experiencethe game pairs you with up to three other players in missions ranging from a stealthy rescue in the overgrown jungles of Earthto an allout extermination in the frozen wastelands of Plutoyou also have a widely explorable openworld areawith its own assortment of missions waiting for you And this openworld thing is only going get bigger in future updates Oh and the updatesthey are a regular thing Likeevery other dayreallythe game community is super protective of the game lore There is a certain point in the game where you will KNOWand then we can talk about itbut until thenyou gotta find out for yourself For now just consider yourself a space ninjajust like most modern mmos The game will be just as hard as you want to handle If you want to go at it casuallytheres content for you If youre looking for a challengegood newsthe enemy level can scale up almost infinitelybad things about warframelots of grindingand you can buy more by using the premium currency While technically you do not need to buy more slotssince you can simply sell what you dont need or wantit is a huge temptation and it is the most likely reason why you will buy platinumif you ever dothe grind is integratd into the core objective of the game Grinding is what you do to pass the time It is so integrated into the game world that you dont really notice it So yeahthere is a lot of grindingbut you have fun while doing itIm not saying warframe should be game of the year or anything more like game of the decadebut the level of attention and communication that Digital Extremes the game devs has with the warframe community and the display of love for their own game is absolutely marvelous These people are setting a new standard for the gaming industryand I can only see good things in the future for themwe dont deserve Warframeyou can have a space dogcatand PET THEM 1010Ive been playing Warframe for a very long time since 201been hating itfanboying over it then hating again Despite all the negative aspects of this game I still recommend trying it outbut let me tell youthe amount of grind this game requires is humongous especially in open world areasyoull have to manually find answers in codex and wikiand theres way too much to learn as most of Warframe aspects are quite unique and cant be learned through playing other games alikeis a very repetitive gameyoull often find yourself doing same thing over and over again be it farming resourceswarframesmods etcwith copypasta open world contentto very buggy and plain boring new mechanics and bosses releases Development of the game nearly stopped and the focus of the game is now to monetize skinsbefore we hit 1 decent update around 70 new skins are releasedraidsgood crafting systems altho it has crafting in OW areas I wouldnt call it anything good or even close to be craftingits locked inside of progression system but quick googleyoutube search could guide you how to start playing thru Quests within 1015 hours of gameplaythis game doesnt have real cool shit to blow your mindthe graphics are not the prime of this gamehoweverwhat compliments it is  unique play models warframes and solid optimizationthis game can run on potatobeleive meIve triedI would say revolutionarycompared to EAActivision etcyou can even get yourself 5075 off deals from time to time when you loginWeapons and skinscostumizations the core game is 100 playable and you can get all of its content for freeexcept skinsbutif you can spend alot of time playing it youll get richor if you cant spend time playing the game but still want to progress faster you can dump few bucks and speed it upyou have bunch of unique Warframesweaponspowers and this game is really trying to make you as powerful as possiblelike clearing your screen with one button tap  thats Warframewe still have the same stuff as we had before with minor additions and I just cant find a random lobby for archwingrailjack missions as no one plays themthis game has pretty massive one Ill give it thatfor a lootershooter game it has pretty nice and unique story which youll find in Quest cinematics and codexwhile other games with less staff giving bigger and passionate updatestry itits free Theres not excuse to ignore itThis game is good if you haveSeeing as Tennocon just happened a few days agoand has been gathering a lot interests since theni think it would be a good idea to finally make a review on this thing I mean i have likewhatb1500 hoursb on this gameso i think i qualified to talk about this gamewhere its about collecting resources and items to craft new guns and armor so you can kill things in more ways You play as a Warframewhich are basically space ninjas Each Warframe comes with a set of abilities to make them all specialand their mobility allows them to get across the stages with easeand will become second nature before you know itWarframe doesnt have a traditional progression system All weapons and Warframes can only reach level 0which you can easily get in a hour or two Howeveryour total rank known as mastery rank only ranks up when you level up new gearand some items are locked behind a mastery rank This means that it doesnt take long for new players to reach the highest level with their gearwith encouraging them to try new things as they play the gameas you can experiment with different builds for your gearb even as a new peoplemeaning it has microtransactionsh1warframe is one of the very best when it comes to thisAlmost all items can be bought from the games shopbut they cost alot compared to how easy some of them are Its as if the game says Looki get ityou dont wanna work to get that shotgunbut its gonna cost you quite a bit to buy it The main you will be buying is instead things like weapon slotswarframe slotsboostersaccessories and so on Theres also a trading system in the gameand it allows you to trade using the games premium currencygiving the game its own economythats good and allbut what are the consh1this is still a loot shootermeaning there will be grinding at times Sometimes its not so badother times it goes a bbitb beyone extreme If games with grinding doesnt suit you at allmaybe you wanna skip this one But heyive over 1000 hours on the gameand im still able to enjoy the game most of the timebut this is a basic overview of what kind of game it isand what you can expect from it If you like what you hearthen give it a tryits free after all Now if you will excuse mei have some uPrime itemsu i need to getIm bored of this game I can barely play it A lot of the new content is more of the same This is a common theme between veteransas you can see from several negative reviews from people with 1k hours into the gameits not due to the game being unfun The average player will find the game quite entertaining for the most part Theres just too high of an expectation of being able to play a game 10 hours a day and not get burnt outyoull have spent more time in this game than youd ever have on several AAA titles combined And its free The monetization is absolutely fair and extremely cheap Seriouslyif you get a 75 discount on one of the Daily Rewards not an uncommon rewardany plat purchased will net so much value and for a long period of timeWarframe is a bit of a mixed bag for me Ive had moments were I really loved it and there have been numerous moments where Ive wanted to smash my desk with a sledgehammerbut what brings it down a bit is the numerous enemies that kill your momentum and the Coop elementsbut the little that Ive seen thus far is pretty interesting510and it runs great I might add And I really like the designs for all the different warframes and cosmeticsI know some people are and kudos to you if youre into that stuff but Im notRelationships are temporary The Voids embrace lasts foreverFree to play done righth1Playersh1but most of the game is for 14 playersbut gets better the more you get into it and the more you read item descriptions and little details After that you have a pretty good story in many aspectsyou can spend thousands of hours if you want toyou just need to dedicate timebut its nothing particularly difficultbut skill will helpbut the basic gameplay stays the samedesigningmodifying your characterlooks goodbut at the same time everything can be completed by playing the game As I said beforethis game has a lot of grindingwhich can be skipped by payingbut its not p2wif you dont like spending a lot of timegrinding and doing some things multiple timesthis game is nothing for you But if you do like those thingsthis game is excellent Especially the movement is just so addicting and you have so many different weaponswarframescompanionsplanetsgamemodesjust try it outespecially since its free Have funh1 TLDR h1this game remains top of the looter shooter genrewith beautiful graphics finally got a good PC lmaolots of customization and lots of characters Youll probably find the frame for you very quickly I have never played a game that was so perfect in regards to how it treats the customer I have more belowbut just know in recent years so much storygame and UI improvements have been dealta universe thriving with lushhidden

plague known as the Infestation has made home Ahand of course the place where youthe noblehonorableTenno have made homeeverything in this game can be earned for completely free You know how I know WellIve been getting EVERYTHING for freeand have spent a fair amount of hours to get this infothis game has more than a dumbed down skill tree This game has a modding system One which lets your power have billions of stat combosEven the placement of mods will determine their effectivenessor platinum premium currencytrading has you covered There are people willing to trade you for modsgearand platinumnow this is a big one This game Warframe has had so many updatesnearly on a monthly basis that it could EASILY have had a Warframe 2 by now For a game being completely freethese updates are WELL worth your time I mean hellweve recently gotten our third open world Completely Freeundeniable factis that this game gets sweeter as time goes on With monumental quests such as The Second Dream and The War Withinthis game will blow you out of your socks Thoughfor somethis can take up to 100200 hours to get to Its crazybut gives you the best feeling and memory afterwards Specifically the Second Dream touched my soul I have played for 6 years or so and after all that timeto see the truth I cant explain the feeling I saved up and purchased the preorder for the Second Dreams statue bundle to commemoratein the gameI was closest to my dear space mom The LotusI know this is a random one but it can really hit you in the feels later on Try looking up This is What You Are  Keith  Itll bring you to a Warframe song that is too goodthe grind was never bad because of my constant progressionbut for people who arent patient or want things quickly in a progression system this might be a bit too muchbut for some major loreand theories on ityoull have to look it up on YouTube If youd like a good series I recommend StallorDthe enemy scaling might be too much Not exactly the ENEMY itselfbut more specifically the ARMOUR on an enemy It can be insane to even damage an enemy after level 100more decorations should be addedAND massive group builds Im talking about decorations that require a load of resources That way if you have a large and active clanyoull have special things that show your true powerand richesa markbodysplit hould happen What I mean is that you do a diagonal slash across the enemies backyet no deep cut appearsor body splitting I dunnojust a requestseeing in the dark is crucial Either an option to turn on and off the flashlight manually or nightvision would be greatly appreciated I dont know about anyone else but seeing in the dark hurts my eyes sometimesoopsienote that this is all speculation and pure opinions I love Warframe If you have any

nodetonode slog and overall content droughtwhen you hear odd sounds in Uranus sealab words GET YOUR SCANNER OUT AND SCAN THE NOODLE MONSTERSh1 Not pay to win h1I want to dispell this notion Anyone who tells you this game is pay to win is wrongor lying to you Most of the good weapons are mastery rank locked and even if you buy things to bypass the grindyou still have to level those Warframes and weaponsyou still have to play the game to grind and get mods for your weapons and Warframes to make them actually perform well in endgame content Youre blindsiding yourself if youre going to make the argument that this game is pay to win Now that Ive gotten that out of the waylets get to the actual reviewbecause its i so beautiful i Everything is well polished and goodlookingthe appearance of Warframe will not hesitate to immerse you into the environment On top of thatgraphically the game is extremely well optimized compared to other gamesand can run on many older computers without an issue There is no section of the game that is forgotten about in regards to visuals Clearlya lot of love has been put into this game and you can tell that immediately just by looking at how beautiful and immersive the game isseriously You can earn Platinumthe premium currencyingame without ever spending a cent on it As for the Warframes themselveseach one is uniqueand there are over 5 of them 5 Thats a lot of different characters to choose from Each of them has 4 unique abilities that do different thingsand you can typically mod a Warframe  different ways or more to focus on a specific part of their ability kit That is a fantastic amount of customization and one of the things I love most about the game I will say that the star chart content can get a bit repetitive at timesbut if you stick it outfill out your star chartand get into high level contentitll feel less repetitive in due time At higher levels the combat gets much more complex Try staying for at least an hour in a survival mission if you decide to playand youll see what I meanlooking good and uniqueness are important aspects of any videogame Warframe has a ton of cosmeticsand theyre all extremely beautiful and wonderful Once you get through all the star chart contentyou may find yourself grinding for Platinum to purchase a new set of clothes or outright buying it with real moneyI wont judge you for it In factsome of the best cosmetics in the game can only be purchased with real money the TennoGen cosmetics are handsomely crafted with love by individual creatorsand your money goes back to those creatorssupporting them and allowing them to make more wonderful content for the gameWarframe probably isnt for you I would still give it a go even if you dont like those types of gamesbut youre probably not going to enjoy it if you arent a patient person Grinding is the name of the game in Warframeand RNG affects many activities in the game If you dont like the fact that you arent guaranteed certain things and have to wait for warframes and weapons to finish building before you can use themor that you have to farm resources to build themthen you probably wont enjoy the game Stillif you invest your time into the grindyou can acquire nearly anything you want for no cost at allwe get new Warframesquestsand contentalbeit they can be buggy at the start We received Sanctuary Onslaughta new gamemodeand The Sacrificea new questearlier this yearand were getting Fortunaan openworld area on Venus later this year Thats a lot of content for one year While its not always the best and most optimized contentI see more love poured into Warframe content than that of any other game at the current time The devs maintain a strong relationship with the community and actively ask questions to the players about what they want to see and what they want changedand do frequent livestreams for fun and for discussing where they are in terms of development with the game Their strong community commitment is one of the great things that many people love about Warframe DEs transparency and willingness to maintain a strong bond with us is something that not many other game companies can brag aboutif you read my entire thing and some of my points sparked your interestI would definitely reccommend giving the game a go I have loved every second Ive played of Warframe and I can honestly say its one of the only games whose future updates Im currently excited for There are no downsides to trying the game out after allits free to play and if you dont like the grind then you can stop at any time and uninstall the game Theres no paywalls or money barriers to any of the content in the game It takes time to grind for resources and build thingsbut if you can develop patiencethat grinding pays offand the game will only get deeper and more complex as a resultIts the game where i met most of my friends and its hard to meet toxic players because its mainly PvE Overall the devs are extremely generous and for the most part listen to the community also RED TEXT
1,ProsNaraka is personally a 1010 game for me Most fun PVP game Ive played in years I have over 1000 hours in PUBG and Apex Legendsbut this game does not really feel like a traditional BR Its more like a fighting game somewhat similar to Mordhau while being hands down the best action combatmelee multiplayer game I have ever played and Ive tried several The overarching BR element takes a lot of inspiration from Apex Legendswhile feeling different enough to not feel like youre playing the same gamethe Souljade system adds a lot of variety in gameplay Each melee weapon has a variety of options for attacks and combos that make the game not feel repetitiveinstead becoming very addictive and rewarding for improving in The skillcap is not that highso even new players have a chance against the best players in the game if they read a few games and get enough practice Unlike other gamesin Naraka you never feel like you cant beat even the sweatiest player The grapple and free climbing system is absolutely amazing considering that you can grapple and climb almost any object you see It has the best animations I have seen in an action combat game and its not even closeeven subtle things like shimmying around corners has its own animation The game does not feel janky at all unlike other games I have played recently New WorldBF 2042 BetaElyon I have not encountered a single bug like falling through the mapgetting stuckglitching through objects etc which is remarkable considering you can traverse and climb EVERYTHINGweapons and environment are fantasticthe audio for each weapon and hero abilities makes them all unique and you can easily tell what is going around you The UI is very intuitiveminimalist and easy to use The gameplay is very fluid and you can even cancel animations without the game feeling janky or glitchyregion switchinglong queuesstrange ranking system But all of those issues all boil down to a low player base at least in the West Difficulty is the other issuethis is a game that will turn away a lot of new players because those who are experienced will smash their face in It is a hard game to start as you will get rolleda lot But for those that stick it out they will hopefully see what a masterpiece this game isthere is no pay to win in the gamelet me repeatNO pay to win in the game incredibly refreshing for an Asian developer The shop has plenty of great skins that can be bought outright to balance out the best cosmetics being locked behind RNG You can play the entire game without being disadvantaged for the base price The only thing locked behind a grind are the glyphs but it takes only a few days to get all glyphs maxed out to be on fair ground with all opponents and teammatesfun and fluidity I primarily rate a game based on how FUN it is to play and for me 99 of that comes from the gameplaynot how shiny the environment is In Narakaeverything WORKSit feels GREAT to playits a whole lotta fun if you invest the time to get better It feels rewarding to duel someone and come out on topor hunt someone downthird partyget a multikilla clutch playa snipea satisfying ultietc The game feels incredibly well made and I think the developers put a lot of thought and love into everythingits a real gem that is sadly being overlooked in the West and I really appreciate that theres still some developers out that are focusing on gameplay over glitz and glamourThis game is actually a lot of funbut watching good players it tends to look pretty fluid and complex so Im sure there is just a skill cap there Go watch a Youtube vid about itit will pay offThis is the best battle royale game I have ever playedparry beats chargedand charged beats basicmaster this and you can get many killsyou still can win the game with default outfitstrio and deathmatchplease understand that not all good games should be freeboth paid games and free games have their own advantage and we should understand that If you cant buy itthen dont buy Video games are not essential Its a luxury and people should only buy when they can afford ityou will feel like a pro until you fight a chines guyBoob physicsall fun and games until 前將軍 pulls upNaraka is a great fastpaced Battle Royalwhich provides a fresh take on the genre and the highskill ceiling of a fighting gamefakesparriesand a lot more tech If you are willing to learn and invest time into itslide

jump out of a window and instead get stuck climbing a wall when in a buildingbut improvement comes with timeits unplayableIm enjoying the game and would recommend you give it a try I truly believe this game has potentialNaraka is hardlike really hardyou will have to learn the mechanics  You either die as a casual or live as a progamerYouve probably seen 100 reviews on the fact that the gameplay is funso I wont touch on that Its a pretty typical battle royalebut with a heavy emphasis on melee combat instead of ranged combat Its funthats about itand the thing 99 of these reviews have been talking aboutwhen you purchase the game you own every single character currently releasedIm sure theyll make you purchase characters later down the linebutI cant review something that isnt released yet The game has various cosmetic microtransactionsa battlepasslootboxesweapon and character skins The game allows you to make customizations to every character like an MMO character creator at absolutely no costallowing you to make some genuinely hilarious creationsa simpler time Overwatch had just released It was a 40 gameand also contained various microtransactions It provided all characters free on releaseand wellyou see where Im going with this The monetization strategies have ZERO in game influenceaside from cosmeticsthats understandablebut make sure youre able to put this game in perspective when you look at its priceand this game does chug at certain moments mostly when grapplingat the time of writing thisI havent tried fucking with graphics settingsbut that might fix itId give the game an 810 Aside from the less than stellar optimizationthe monetization is no more aggressive than 99 of other video games these days CSGO started as a pay to play game with lootboxesso did Overwatch Worst case scenariogive it a shotyou can always refund itIm like Samurai Jack my katana is always with mebGameEngineb Unitywith the rise of cheaters in this gameits to give a fair warning on this gameget some weapons and fight with martial arts and multiple abilitiesread up on NeacProtect and how easy it is to bypassbut up to 40 a gamelots of botsthe gameplay is uniqueI hate BR games but love Narakabut with the rampant cheatingthe abysmal MMR system I cant recommend this at allstay awaythen sure try it For nowsave your money for a salesince they have a battlepassbut theres so much moreReview Subject to Changeranged combat strategy Feels well donethe movement is not clunky and the combat for the most part is pretty fluent The character editor is fun and ofcourse the cosmetics are nice  Ive logged many hours in this game and can really see what needs adjustmentsyour attacks phase through their body So as you can see why all the top players are chinesethe weapons and heroes need much balancing As I am sure most people have noticed being grappled hook stun spammed This could easily be fixed by disabling Auto lock on Melee and Hooks in ranked play This in turn would make the game more skill based and the engagements more interesting Instead of being grapple stunned for people to long sword slash spam you Heroes such as  need some work His 150m range grab not only needs to be much sorter Id say about the range of a grapple hook with 50 range and it also needs a cool down 58 seconds You could give him a small AOE ground pound to make up for the CD wait time Long Sword Slash needs much fine tuningthe Katana stun lock needs some workthe spears whirlwind attack needs some adjusting as wellect ectits interesting enough The issue is with the way the character grabs onto ever little thing and you tend to get stuck on it Some objects such as small rocks need better clip nodes so the characters and step over them a bit easier instead of just coming to a full stop and then getting stucklock the ping to keep the ping abusers out You know who you are and rebalance some of the heroesweapons I would be not only thrilled with thisbut would give this a positive review As I am sure a lot of you would as wellWARNING HOT TAKES AHEADbut the developers probably bent over and let NetEase force a lot of the obvious Eastern market standards onto the eventual release That or the Montreal studio is a literal frontyoull be playing with Chinese players most of the timeessentiallyfabricate false first impressions of the game and make you feel like youre goodthus selling you passed the refundable time period I played about  gameswon the first and last but lost the second Honestly I should have lost all  Im terrible at BR games in general Winning those 2 games with over a fourth of the lobbys members really rubbed me the wrong wayfalse positives and allits gotprobably the best kit in the game Make of that what you will as skill is obviously a factorfurther milking the hornynot sure if its runningif you encounter that youll probably want to go check your task manager for the only task running in Chineseor at leastincomprehensible enough looking exe nameI think this game should be F2Pits pretty and all but man does it feel forced Id recommend trying Spellbreak if you want to fill that nonFPS Battle Royale itch I dont really recommend this games communitysocials eitherlots of people willing to lose their cool over your negative review on the gameThis game is actually a lot of fun Its a highpaced BR that can be overwhelming at first but is fairly straightforward once you get the hang of it Only leaving this review as a not recommended because they dont region lock players Playing in NA might as well be playing on Asian servers playing against a bunch of 500 ping players who cant be hit If they start enforcing region lockingI will change my reviewHERES A REVIEW THAT DOESNT CRY ABOUT THE MTX SHOPSjust dont buy the cosmetics I dont get the issuejust learn the game instead of crying that you died to things you dont understanddisarming the opponentleft click attacks are typically horizontal while right clicks are vertical Side step vertical slashesback step horizontalthen parry in the window between the 2nd and rd attackallowing you to parry the third Focusimmediately going into a sprintthen holding left or right click for your Focus attack Youll then charge your Focus attack while sliding in the direction you were using itIf you can put in the time to learn its mechanicsthe game is fun and plays like a fighting game with fast pacedfluid movementits not worth playing or buying until a ping restriction is implemented on servers Combat mechanics fall apart completely when playing against players that connect to servers overseas to avoid playing in their own region On the NA serverlobbies frequently have more of these overseas players than actual NA region playersand this problem is exacerbated depending on the time of day you playAFrigginMazing  I cant remember the last time I spent this much time on a video game  This is a very fresh take on the Battle Royale feel  Surethe same concept of getting to the circle has been done  But this combat  The characters and abilities  The CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATIONS  Truly I had no choice but to come on here and write about this because I need to do my part to make sure everyone gets this game  It is a BLAST and although as frustrating as it can be learningthat moment you master counteringand dodging in the split second that it counts is so rewarding  Now I just need  to find gaming friends to enjoy this with  But shout out to all the work that went into this because this game is the best  Ive never been so glad to have a nice computer to be able to play it on  PS  you should definitely try and look at some of the tutorials online to help you learn tips and tricks from beta  It is actually extremely helpful that they give you a tutorial at the beginning but Im finding myself just looking at videos online to get better  Good luckBoobabooba
1,Its really funbut honestly it should be Wait 4 SalePretty decent and allbut in its current state game is double the price it should be Get it on saleWe need Workshop and Versus Campaign for the gameotherwise the game will die sooner or laterI have been waiting for this moment After playing for 150 hours and having completed all acts on RecruitVeteran and Nightmare difficultiesI can finally write a quality reviewhence I cannot recommend this game I want to feel happy when I play videogamesI dont feel happy when I play this gameat allthe people who play this gamedifficulty scaling is so badly designed in this game Recruit is too easy and VeteranNightmare are too hard No matter what you saythis is a fact And you can’t argue against facts and statistics A very low percentage of players have completed this game on VeteranNightmare judging from the achievement statistics I have no clue what the devs were thinking when they were implementing these difficulties The “Corruption cards” and absolutely disgusting special ridden spawn rate makes it even worsethat it is close to impossible to complete it without speed decks You need a lot of luck as well This kinda takes away the whole point of the game  slaying zombies But playing without speed decks on Nightmare mode will just make your day worse and not worth your time since its absurdly brokenever played a zombie game that was so RNG based “Corruption cards” are your worst enemies and can cost you a lot of wasted time and resets It just feels so wrong when a Breaker spawns in the worst possible time  if you have acid zombies  running zombies  armored StingersHockers  Tallboy hordes HAHA  all the other bullshit Or you die just because a Hocker snipes you and as you may knowits often not possible to dodge their aimbot spit or 5 Tallboys spawn in your face And thats why we come to the next pointeveryone who I play with experiences the same thing Apparentlyif you go too fastridden fail to load in to the map properly and they start stuttering Looks terrible and they literally can teleport on top of you and kill youthis is a very small thing but still is very annoying If you want to invite someone you have to add them as a friend to do so I find that very inconvenient Alsoyour ingame friend list is not sorted in alphabetical order seriouslydevstotally unoriginal weapon skins green camo  seriouslydevs and some character skins that look almost the same as the original skins I am shocked about the fact how unoriginal the devs areinfinite coppermap skipsseriously devs I just cant comprehend anymorethe game should always put me in European servers If I play with 1 Americanit puts us in an American server even if Im the host Same thing goes with Singapore like I am completely done at this pointrunning out of continues You have to restart from the very first mission just because you failed on the last one and you cant even practise the last mission more in order to gain more knowledge and possibly think of new strats You have to start from the VERY BEGINNING  If you play without speed decksyoure going to be completely washed up after thisexcept the ZWAT outfits maybebut it needs some heavy polishingNow I like this game Feels like left 4 dead but modern and fresh The only reason I’m not recommending it is because you are basically penalized for playing solo campaign You do not earn any currency or progression by playing solo and I don’t agree with that Not everyone wants to play a game like this with people and progression towards currency and achievementsetc should not be locked for doing soIts a good gamebut not worth 60 Wait for it to go on salebWarning 1b Do not expect this to be Left 4 Dead 3 If you expect thisyou are setting yourself up for some disappointment It also restricts progression if you play it solounless you play with someone who has bought them  in which caseyoull be forced to download and store GBs of data you cannot even use when playing soloplease refrain from using it entirely The game will provide an early warningnot a progressionon its own its a solid game with countless great qualitiesfrom environments to charactersand lightingextensive color blind optionsyou will have fun running aroundand being able to use them all in Fort Hope right away is also coolbut would benefit from more places of utility in future updateseven if questionable decisions were made Its now just a matter of the community keeping future decisions in check  since we wont be able to do any of that ourselves with modslook up Chet Faliszeks Anacrusis Discord server  those are the other exL4D devs who actually careLove the game but please let us remove attachments and set it up on a better weapon when we get oneThe developers have proven with the November update that they truly DONT listen to user feedback and lack the courage to be transparent about their unsurprisingly unpopular game decisions It was questionable whether this game was worth the 60 price tag given the dearth of content Andwith their most recent update reinforcing what makes the game bad success on higher game difficulties being heavily swayed by enemy RNGwhile nerfing things that make the game fun builds that actually allow you to participate in combat despite the enemy RNG tips the scale quite negatively The current meta to improve success on higher game difficulties is to just speedrun though each leveleffectively skipping over sections of the maps highly sensitive to wild enemy RNG that borders on simply being bullshit Its as if the developers dont actually play their own gamwaitthats probably truethat seems to be getting worse with each updatedo yourself a favor and play this for 1 on Xbox Game Pass which has a PC version That way youll only be disappointed for wasting 1 on this impending failure of a AAA gameI wish I could give this game a mixed option I love coop games so much in the classic Left 4 Dead styleand I do enjoy this game The gun play is a lot of fun and theres a lot more weapons to choose from than in classic titlesso when Im done with work for the dayI dont want to spend two hours trying to find teammates that are more invested in the game than racial slurs The bots in this game are GOD AWFUL In Easy difficultyyou can plow through the first half of the gamebut the second half starts to get sticky with the AI The first half on Medium difficulty is a good challengebut the second half is practically unbeatable The bots are constantly walking directly into your line of firegetting stuck on everythingthey dont heal when you ever actually need itand good luck playing with any melee buildsyoure not allowed to unlock anything when you play solo Cardscosmeticsachievementsetcespecially by the time youre actually old enough to buy this gamebut for the most partits all pretty copypasteespecially when you compare it to the contrast of classic titlesIll gladly update thisbut for now Id wait for a sale Especially if you play aloneAfter about 50 hours in the open beta and 40 in the final releaseI feel comfortable saying its a pretty good gamethere are some valid criticisms to be made The easiest difficulty is incredibly easyand the next is significantly harder This difficulty curve really feels like it punishes individual players who dont have a group of friends to play with Its a very teamoriented gameand to call playing with randoms oonlinehit or miss is being generousthe recruit difficulty does very little to prepare you for just how teamoriented the game is If you play this like you would play Left 4 Deadwhere all the characters are interchangeable and you dont need to worry too much about weapon types or skills each player usesyou can beat recruit fairly easilybut you will never beat the other modes Howeversince many people will begin on recruit and see these strategies workit wont be apparent just how important player specialisation is It can give players who start there a false sense of how they should play the game and set them up for frustration laterone of my biggest complaints is the continue system It is unnecessarily punishing without contributing virtually anything to the fun of the game I can recognise that some players may value the challengebut forcing us to replay multiple levels because of some bad RNG feels like bad designespecially on recruit  veteran I would disable it if I couldand hope that a future patch will make this an optionhoweverI find the game incredibly fun with a high degree of replayability There are definitely some things I could suggest to improve itbutoverallI think its a very solid experiencetoo easyor less funbut in the later acts it can still be a challenge Plus its a great way to unlock some cards before trying the harder difficultyand the order of the decks matter You draw the cards in order every timeso space them out accordingly You can see ahead of time what missions youll have andassuming 1 card per missionyou can tell when youll draw a certain card Use this to your advantage to get the cards you need right when you need themand your team should have one of each Whichever you are usinggo allin A jackofalltrades build sounds good on paperbut you will pay for it in harder difficultiesbut thats entirely wrong You can customise to your hearts contentand just because something works for them doesnt mean it will work for you Using their strats or decks can be a good starting pointand may even work wellbut you should not believe anyone presenting them as the best or the only correct build Tweak it until it works for youand having fewer things unlocked just gives you things to look forward to You arent worse for itand everyones been where you areso dont stress and enjoy the gameIts an amazing gamebut definitely needs some things fixedmore like 3040 at mostfun game with friendsim so sorryFOR SOLOLONE WOLF PLAYERSDont go in expecting Left 4 Dead 3In the November UpdateTurtle Rock Studios pushed ahead their design choices that reduce playerstrength overall when difficulty was one of the major criticismswhile not addressing ingame issues that aggravated the player base for the first month The incomplete update and fixes also introduced new bugs and changes that were not listed in the patch noteCleaner passive being randomly disableda Cleaner being launched into the sky and dying to fall damage after grabbed by a Stalkerand many more including those from Open Beta as wellattack patternsamountsand spawn locations of Special Infectedand the lack of countermeasures against themespecially having trouble navigating through tight corridorsand the player base had been suffering and still going through the aforementioned problems for more than 3 weeksthe backlash from the community has been significant Its because of the inconvenience they had to experience from launch issuesand the game was already difficult to begin with Theyve been claiming the developers are out of touchhave the wrong priority listand need to play their own gameI find myself agreeing with themits even messier now Postpatchthere are new bugs that allows people to throw grenades indefinitelyplayers receiving 1 Trauma despite Temp Health COMPLETELY protecting Health lossbosses appearing at levels where the level design could not properly handle them in the first place ie Hag at Resurgence unable to disengage due to getting stuck on a wallthis is a disturbing sight to watch I have shelved the game for nowand am planning to monitor how situation unfoldsand release properly tested updates if they wish to continue servicing the gameDefinitely not worth the £60 price tagmixed with many poor  questionable game design decisionsoverallextremely poorly designed In terms of visualssoundand the way that they workand the way you can counter themin Left 4 Deadeach special infected has a very clear silhouette The SpitterChargerBoomerJockeyetcall have very distinguishable visuals Very easy to identify On top of thatthey play very easily recognizable sounds right before spawningso that you and the team have time to react to the fact that they are there And most importantlythey were all designed so that you are able to counter their attacks if you have the skill and reaction to itit plays a sound right before attackingand the tongue takes a while to reach you During this timethe smoker is very weak so that you can quickly locate and shoot it if you are fast enough Additionallyyou can attack the tongue with a welltimed melee attack as well  For the hunter and jockeyyou can either backtrack and forwardcharge with a shove attack to make them stumble temporarilyor even do a well timed shove while they are in the airright backing attacking you I can keep on with these examplesnone of these nuances are to be found in Back 4 Blood The special ridden seem generally designed to be tanky as hell able to soak up a whole lot of damagewith attacks that does not in any sense seem designed to have clear countermechanics that you can employ The Tallboy just walks towards youuntil it does a lastminute sprint of godlike speed to grab you if its the crusher mutation The spitter variants of the special ridden just have projectiles that fire at the speed of lightmaking you unable to dodge themall you can do is try your best to find cover while their insanely low cooldowns means that they just keep on spamming attacks on you The Retch can spew vomit from 500 km awayalso at high velocity And what they all have in common is that they are basically extremely tanky In any casethe best counter you end up employing is either to run like hellor simply shoot them as fast as possiblepraying that they dont reach you before you do Now you can try doing this with 5 Tallboys and 4 spitters  hockerswhilst you have a reeker running towards you I guess because they were too incompetent to come up with better designsthe best way they can increase the difficulty is just to throw all of this at you at oncebut in practice I think it works poorly with the rest of the gamewith assault weaponswith shotgunsetcand I dont think it plays nicely with balance and corruption cards either In generalit doesnt play well with the overall dynamic and adjust as you go along type of game that B4B tries to be with corruption cardsyou can make a build that makes you good with a certain type of weaponsure But you will not exactly be sure when you will be able to get a good quality weapon of that type because the weapon drops and the store weapons are random This will matter a whole lot of harder difficulties Getting what you need for your build to work best will be at the mercy of the RNG godsdecks are very static by nature You create a deck You choose one at the start of your runand then you are locked to that deck for the entirety of that run No matter what corruption cards are thrown at youand no matter what else happens in the game This means that even though the game tries to be dynamic and throw you surprisesyou generally cant use your deck to adjust to any of it Your deck is what it isand at any one point after each levelyou will only be able to pick 5 cards from your deckalso taking into account that the sequence of cards matters as well This leaves you very little wiggle room to do any meaningful choice regarding your cards once a run has startedI dont understand why they dont just do away with the concept of decksand simply allowed people to choose from the entirety of the card pool at the beginning of each level You will still be able to create builds the same way you do it with decksthe only difference will simply be that players are more free to pick and choose as the game progress It seems very arbitrary to lock people at a predefined stack of 15 cards What good does that dobalancing with the card system is also a bit off When you get to higher difficultiesthe powers and abilities of cards matters a blotb But by the very nature of the designyou will always start out weak At the start of the runyou will always have fewer cards than at the end Meaning the game will at times be harder simply by the fact that you dont have access to as many cards as later its just odd compared to being equal in power throughout an entire Act  campaign But maybe thats just meand ruin the overall impressionbno manual toggle flashlightb Really Apparently modern game design loves to take step backs on what seems like obviousbasic functionality A decade old game like L4D and many other games did this Why cant I toggle my flashlight Seriouslywhy There are many times where Ive wanted to toggle the flashlight where the game did not do it for me And if I have to hear another fanboy tell me to simply adjust my brightness Ill go crazy Why should we have to make either gamewide or systemwide adjustments to make up for such an extremely simply feature that would be so easy to put inin the first place Againit makes no sensebremoving attachments cannot be doneb Againwhat is this insanity And yesI knowthey are working on adding a card that does it But seriouslya icardi WHY cant it just be something you can do The only thing this atrocious design decision has done so far is basically punish me and my friends from picking up higher tier weapons because we have had lower tier weapons with better attachments With all other things that go on in the game of RNGwhy should it be a risk to pick up another weapon and just pray to the RNG gods that you then get the attachments you want later I just dont understand itcar alarms and door alarms are designed extremely poorly in relation to projectiles You can trigger cars and doors miles and miles ahead in the level that you have no chance of currently seeingbecause there seemingly are no radius at which the player has to be within before shooting alarms triggers them This doesnt provide any good No amount of skill will be able to get you out of that situationbesides constantly shooting towards the ground Maybe you think thats good designI certainly dont Youre punishing the player for something heshe is not yet able to react tonot really recommended Go play something like L4D instead Back 4 Blood is a pretty weird game Is it good Kindaits decent Half of it is greatit is one of the more engaging horde shooter experiences The other half is a janky game with weird design choices that really hamper the enjoyment of this titleheadshots pop zombies quick and it feels satisfying to snipe Shotguns feel powerful as isand generally all guns are pretty decent at their role You can modify the guns to behave slightly differently and with the cards system it changes more as welland the game uses a RPG style colored loot tier that does not gel very well imocritsand get cards that reload your rifle while you switch to your sidearm You can build a melee deck  shotgun hybrid with good move speed and healing effects Quite a fair bit of choiceswith some meta cards on higher difficultiesyou have to grind out unlocking these cards by advancing the tiers They are like battle passesand you cannot selectively choose what you want in each pass At the start of the gameyour cards are pretty badso if you want to play on higher difficultiesyou have to grind quite a bit This is good for some looking for farming experience to prolong shelf life thoughvisuals are great Very atmospheric Distant gunfirescreamsgrowlsthe world feels very alive and you feel like you are part of the war The voice acting is decentand the characters have some interaction with each other  I do like the whole angle of how you are part of the remaining military carrying out operations and strikes against the zombies vs the usual survivors merely living theme Levels are pretty well donewith set pieces that are fun to navigate and look atwith a lot of reused areas The same map can be reused 3 timesonce each campaignexcept with some changes in pathing and the time of day  This isnt that big of an issuebut it does feel a little stale after a while of grindingand specialswhile pretty engaging to tackledo have a big issue of spawning in massive amounts The game likes to do the l4d equivalent of spawning 4 spitters4 boomers3 chargers1 witch and a tank all at the same timefrom spawn points literally a few meters from your team The result is a coin toss where some runs are very easy due to far spawns and sometimes you just wipe because the game thinks its funny to spawn 3 of the smasher types around a small bend and then 2 exploding specials behind you so you have nowhere to retreat toall the while having another 2 specials that can range grab you You end up with a wide range from smooth easy runs on higher difficulties when everything falls into place nicely or some badly spawned combinations just wipe your teamand this sentiment I had before and now2 hours after launch early accessI share the same view More free content needs to happenbut looking at Evolve my hopes arent high The game can feel a little stale unless youre okay with grinding for supply points to unlock cards in the same environment for hours on end A recommendbut take cautionThe game is alrightbut the blatant anticonsumerism is staggeringyou need to be connected to their servers No progress is gained in solo play eitheronly in multiplayerremoved at release Have household members that want to play No splitscreen so buy multiple copies insteadonly the ones selling it and their walletsMight be a decent game but the developers choice to disable card progression  supply points  unlocking new characters when playing solo makes this a complete no go for me What a shame
1,My wife  I enjoy this game together  We love the cooperative clean fun  challenges  She doesnt have a lot of mobility because of a rare disease so this is a way for us to get out  Thank youI bought two copiesone for my sevenyearold daughterand one for myself I host a nondedicated session and invite her through Steamand we spend hours tranquilizing dinosaurstaming themand collecting them on our island I use the cheat codes to spawn all the items we want using the ark wiki and double tab and we have a great time I recently purchased two copies of Scorched Earthand we spawned in tons of air conditioners and wyvern eggs to hatch baby dragonsthen we spawned in a bunch of wyvern milk to grow and tame themas kids arent really the target demographicbut I thought Id give it a thumbs up anywaysThis is a review of the offline gamewe ran around killing everything After about 3 mins of running and killing things I decided to go home and give my new buddy a rest We ran through the night and in the morning i realized how extra lost i was and got worried I decided that the best way to find my way home was to climb a mountain and look around After 5 mins or so of looking and referencing the map I finally figured out where we were Just as I was about to put my map away I was ambushed by several scorpions and unfortunately they killed meNote At least 1 of my hours were spent on Official Servers Thus my review will pertain to Official Serversthese people will either be total jerks and just kill you over and overor they will be really chilland youll form a tribe with them  You will spend countless hours with these people farming materialstaming dinosaursand build bases  You will grow more and more in power  You will be meeting other players either passing through the server or settling down  You will know all the other tribes on the server that are worth knowing ie the big tribes or friendly tribes  You will come across numerous other cultures as you find Chinese tribes and Spanish tribesFrench and Germanall while growing more and more powerful  You will on occassion have a set backbut at this point youre on a roll and now the games mechanicshave a good group of friendsand objectives that you have given yourself  You will feel happy with what you have accomplishedwhile it can be delayed for long periods of timeit will eventually come  And so another tribe will pick a fight with you  Your tribe will fight their tribeand you may lose or you may win  Either way youve invested a lot into this server and these friendsso youll never give up  Some other tribes will jointhe fightpicking sides  The winning side will probably kill all the dinostake all the matsand kill everyone on the losing side  Thus you have won your first war  You are now a power on the server worth being reckoned with  Soon enoughyoull get in an even bigger war as the losing side draws more and more people to aide them and you respond by getting more as well  Now the entire server is split 55and a great war mars the server for days as both sides are constantly wiping one anothers bases  Eventually youll win thoughand the other side will leave the server  Theyll be fed up  As the enemies are now goneyou are happy once more  You hated them just as they hated youa couple weeks  There is trouble brewing as a few of your allies are begin to grow wrestless and have infighting  Peace will try to be maintained through talks  But it will fail in the endand more war will arise  This cycle will continue until only 2 tribes remain  These two tribes will be dominant in every regard leadershiptacticsdinosaursand materials  Pitted against one another to see who will rule the server  You will fight your heart out against your former allies  You will destroy bases youd once entered as a friendnow as an enemy  You will kill dinos whose names you helped come up with  You and your tribemates will be cycling out who gets to sleep because the battle will last over 24 hours  The fight will go on and on and on and on with no end  It will be exhileratingmonths ago when you were just a little tribe starting outwill all be gone  Everyone youd ever fought with and fought against are gone  While there is some joy in victoryit is very bitter as there is no one left to share it with  Your tribemates will still playbut its not the same  Even if not in your tribeyou had a community Friends Foes Maybe even lovers  Now all that is gone  You will pass the ruins of these once great tribes and feel a hole in your heart  New people will always arrive to challenge youbut youll always beat them down  Destroying any hope they had  Youll build fortresses thatll reach the Heavens and have so many dinos itll cause server lag  Youll build Great Walls across vast territories in order to denote your power  Finallyyoull get bored and leaveand one day youll see Ark still in your library and hop back on  Youll log back into your old server  Everything is different  New namesfacesbaseseverything  Not a single structure you had built is left standingnot a single ruin  All of it is gone  The people on this server see you log in and ask if you want to join their tribe saying that Ark can be harsh for noobsbut you could never tell them  You could never tell them an entire servers history  The hundreds of thousands of hours of work youd seen put in by that ancient world  The structures they couldnt ever even imagine  The wars youd fought and people youd met  You could never explain to them what it all had meant to youfor it is all now gone  In its place is a new worldcompletely distinct from the original while maintaining a strong similarity  You will be both extremely happy at this new worldand profoundly sad about the world that was lostno game will ever make you feel as strongly about the decisions youve made than Ark Survival Evolved  Beware that you may get addicted and lose your real social life and ambitions in exchange for this game  But youll meet people youd never have met otherwisesee things you never thought possiblecommit acts that would make tyrants think youre true evil or saints believe you are the second coming of Jesus Christ  In the endyoull feel stronger emotions then any youve ever felt from playing a gameSince most people are bashing the PvP servers for the griefingI feel like someone should answer that and also talk a bit about the PvE serversabout half of that on PvP servers and half of that on PvEall official ones All the thing people say about the griefers is truetheyll kill your dinossteal your stuffabuse your body and destroy your house as soon as you go to sleep In fact a lot of tribes organize group to play past midnight for the sole reason of hunting sleeping players And thats the keyword here TRIBES If youre playing on a PvP server you gotta keep in mind that youre not supposed to do it at your pace and take your time building your little Tatch hut with its little thatch fence with your Raptor and a couple of Dilos Slowly learning the game by yourselftaking everything ineventually upgrading to Wood and then Stone and so forthmaybe even a weekbut alone youre doomed to be foundrobbed and killed And like many others saidhave the work of a whole week go down the drain If youre joining a PvP server youre doing it for Tribe warfare and let me assure youthing can get really intensereally epic pretty fast With eagles swooping down to grab enemies and droping them from high altitues to their deathsor tactical droping Raptors inside their base to wreak havokTRexes working as battering rams at the enemies gates while rockets fly at themautoturrets spewing bullets at your Carno armySabretooths leaping over walls It is a beauty to beholdnothing else Theyll keep you from taming dinos by killing them mid proccessblock caverns so only they can harvest the resourcesliterally kidnap you to use you as a blood bag Mad Max style and so onafter all theyre just being preayed upontheyre not participating in all the fun that is Tribe Wars But the only way to Tribe Wars be so much fun is allowing all this kind of freedom the game has right nowthey gotta allow people to be complete aholes because during wars thats what you gotta be If they put too many safety nets to keep people who wanna do PvP only when THEY wanna do PvP the game would be boring and staledont be First of all because you dont really need PvP for this game to be fun Theres a TON of stuff to do in PvE servers or offline if you just wanna do everything at your pace I got a bit tired of all the pressure on PvP servers and have been playing in a PvE for around 6 hours right now And I still only got only a Wood base with some Dinosjust hit level 45and I feel like Ill never run out of things to do because the devs just keep adding and adding stuff almost each day People are also very helpful on PvE serverstheyll give you a hand when you have problems with a Rexhelp you gather Prime meat when youre taming a Carnivoregive you tips and materials At least on my server I got absolutely nothing to complain about themREJOICE Because theyll soon add War Declaration to PvE serversso tribes can actually go at war when they feel like itwithout all the griefing to new players who want just to keep to themselvesId like to congratulate the Devs Theyre doing a terrific job Optimization is alreayd a LOT betterstill not there yetbut much better The content is fantastic and it just keeps coming Bugs are rarer and rarerin fact I dont even remember the last time I experienced oneand its also pretty cheapH1THIS IS A DAY 1 REVIEW AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS THE DEVELOPMENT CONTINUESH1objectivesetcsome do notthey will own your butt unless you hit a hill or something Not really a Contheyre just dcksbut please keep in mind that this is a VERY Early Access game despite the fact that there is a lot about it that simply looksand somewhat feelspolished the dinosaurs are amazing If you cannot or do not want to deal with the current CONS then you should wait at least a week and come back and check out the changes the Devs push otherwise Im saying go ahead and drop the 2489USD and try your hand at playingh1├Professors Review┤h1to rocket launchersand turretskilling you upon spawnBut rememeber that the game is still in bALPHA STAGESb It still has a ways to go before it finishedbut it is headed in the right direction It gets your heart pumping when you have a lot to loseand you got a giant dinosaur chasing you down through a forestconsider giving it a thumbs upiand they think they are bringing some sort of new information to everyone by saying ityou can tell its not fakeFirst review i wrote for a game but it had to be doneA nearby chinese tribe gave us some stuff to start out and we were hooked to the game pretty much instantly There were some big tribe wars going on on the server but we were left alonecarrying heavy loadstransportationcombatyou name it and we eventually also tamed a few trexes and the stronger end game dinos You name them all and because of their different tasks and stat builds you become sort of attached to your dinos as well which makes the game even betterDestroyed usarrows and food and approached their base The chinese built a enormous stone castle on the water where they stored most of their Egg farm dinos in I went to the beach swam underneath the base found a spot where i could hack away at their stone walls to get inside Found a good spot and made a start tribe members brought over grenades and we blew though the wall Out came charging a Trex and 5 raptors at insane speed we started backing off while firing at them The water slowed them down Called for the rest of the tribe to head over we ended up fighting them on foot with primitive weapons After a long fight we took them out one by one and eventually they all lay dead That feeling of Vengeance is undescribable but we werent satisfied We headed back into the dino pen and laid waste to their entire egg farmwe killed over 2 Stegos three mammoths and a few ankylosIt was a massacre Fueled by the loss of our pets and friendsAfter a few hours playing i just felt i had to type down something about the game First off the game looks realy niceno way i could say it was a early access game if i didnt know it alrdy No major game breaking buggs so farsome bigger dinos stuck between trees but so far i just seen a handfull of themi legged back to the beach where i woke upfish should be easy food to catchI swam out to a big boulder just where the sea got alittle deeperspotting a fish getting rdy to jump into the water and spearing it i saw a big shadow comming closer a shark the size of 2 carsMy dino i came to call Fido was defending me and the house without mercy Oneday i felt the gound shake as a pack of big herbivores deciced that my house was totaly in the wrong place and started to attack it Fido the good guard dog as he was attacked without delay Outnumberd and outpowerd we fought them side by side for almost 3 min killing off 6 of the 8 attackers when Fido didnt have anymore fight in him and fell to the ground to never raise again I without any backup was no match for the remaining two and i had to fall back into my house and gather as mutch of my resources i could carry and the flee The only thing i could do was to watch from afar with my spyglass the destruction of my house and mourn the death of my brave FidoThis is a review of the offline gamewe ran around killing everything After about 3 mins of running and killing things I decided to go home and give my new buddy a rest We ran through the night and in the morning i realised how extra lost i was and got worried I decided that the best way to find my way home was to climb a mountain and look around After 5 mins or so of looking and referencing the map I finally figured out where we were Just as I was about to put my map away I was ambushed by several scorpions and unfortunately they killed meArk is easily my favorite game Ive every played It goes so deep The gameplay is super fun but also unfair at times You are weak at first and dinosaurs are strong and merciless Expect to die you dont really lose anything when you die as long as you go and get your stuffthough your tamed dinosaurs die permanentlyI couldnt recommend this game morethe official servers seem depressing because you constantly get raided by other players Our personal server is hosted on Nitrado Nitrados service totally stinks to set upbut works great after its up and running We adjusted the settings to make breeding go faster and animals eat lessbut other than that we basically play vanilla Ark with the two of us in our own worldI loved coplaying Minecraft and Diablo 3I have over 5 hours into the gamecompared to a lot of ARK players im still a noobso if you arent ready to turn this into a full time jobdont even bother thinking about getting this game Ill explain why this game is a full time job later onbut basically it punishes any player that cant or wont play it 247the biggest and in my opinion the coolest of the three maps The beginning is the hardest part for new players Every dino you meet can easily kill a noobeven the spitter dinos It can be annoying running around naked and getting killed by raptorsbut stick with it and find your friends and build a safe place Once you get the base builtthe game gets so much more fun Every new dino you find is cooland it so fun the first time you get all your friends together and explore a cave The most dangerous foes we encountered in PvE were the alpha predators Our base got destroyed multiple times by alpha raptorsbut it was fun because it showed us that even though we had a big base with spike walls and guard towersthere was still a threat out there that had to be beaten Of course once you build a metal base nothing can break it anymoreand once you tame flying mounts you dont have to worry about dangerous expeditions so late game it got boring We basically got to the point that nothing PvE had to throw at us outside of boss battles was a challengeand even fighting bosses had no point because what would we use the tek gear to kill Harder versions of that boss Thats why we decided to turn to PvP to see if that was better late gamedont PvP This game is designed in such a way that the big tribes that are on top stay on top New tribes and new players just get pooped on in every single way unless they join an alpha and become a resource harvesting slave Lets walk through all the reason PvP is horriblethey wont let anyone else even enjoy the gameyou dont get a basethey might let you live in a thatch hut Refer to reason 1you dont get to tame dinosthey might let you tame dodos Refer to reason 1you dont get to upgrade any of your gear Alphas block all loot drops the good ones anyway and fill all the caves with autoturrets to gun down anyone that tries to explore themand you wont get close enough to plant c4 You wont be able to bring dinos to tank the turrets eitherrefer to 1you dont get to save any of your dinosyou dont even get to fight backits all just gone This happens all the timeand honestly offlineraid protection should be baseline on all serverssleep or work or whateverthen they will know and they will raid you They can even get text alerts that tell them the second you have logged off or onor if anything else unusual is going on on their server Basicallythis site and sites like it are cancer Alsoit doesnt tell them your in game namebut your steam namethat means even if you make another character they will know its you Alsoif you piss them off and try to go to another serverthey can just look up where you went using Battlemetrics and come find you There is no hiding and no escapeso you have to be nice and cant even PvP or else some loser with no life is going to come and find you on every single server you go to If you run into anyone named 123 and a private profileBEWAREeach hatched dino is gonna be 2x the level of anything a noob will haveif the fact that they have 23x better dinos by building huge breeding rooms wasnt a big enough edgenow they get tek gear too If they come at you with anything tek and you have baseline gear and baseline dinosyou are DEADand you must grind harder than everyone else to make sure you have the defenses and dinos to stop raiders Dont botheryou wontIm tired of typing this reviewjust know that if you enjoy PvP because you enjoy winning through skillthen dont PvP No PvP skill is required at this pointtheir gear will have much higher armor and damagetheir dinos will have much higher hp and damagejust accept your death and wipe multiple times because you will lose everything and you wont even be online to defend itnot like youd have a chance even if you werebut now that it is I feel like I should address all the kids telling me I suck and that Im still a noob who doesnt know what hes talking aboutthis is NOT a skill based game This is a grind basedoffline raid basedexploit based game You cant come here and say Im a noobespecially when Ive played the game solo and as a small tribe for over 3 hoursand I joined an alpha tribe for a week or two so I know how it goes on a larger scale My opinion actually got even worse after joining the alpha tribe because I realized just how bad the game panders to them Here are some more reasons why I will never recommend this game to anyone that I found from my time with the alphasyou would probably expect this After allthey have more players so it is only natural that they could send 5 out to grind while your tribe could only spare 1 Nonumbers isnt even what Im talking about hereIm talking about EXPLOITS with a farming dino and a Quetzal A noob with a hatchet can get 56 wood from a single tree An alpha tribe can get 15 wood from a single tree A noob with a pickaxe can get 56 metal from a veinan alpha tribe can get 3 metal from a vein A noob would take hours to farm 12k metalan alpha tribe can farm 23k metal in an hour The list goes on and every single resource you can think of they can get insane amounts much faster and easier Nownoobs wont know how to do thisand wouldnt be able to because Quetzals are hard to tameand hard to hide from alpha tribes If they saw you flying around harvestingthey would bring a Wyvern after you and start looking for your basebut if you get more than 2 players in a serverthe lag becomes unbearable Once againalpha tribes exploit this by logging as many people as they can onto a server kind of like DDOS to block out defenders from connectingor to force the server to get so laggy that you can basically avoid taking damage from thingsIm at a point where Im about to hit 2 solid hours of gaming and feel I have a good enough grasp of the game to review it So here goesGoGetcthis is an Early Access title So of course the launch was plagued with issuesand the server numbers didnt cover the 1 players BUTthe devs have made some of the most aggressive moves to resolve the issues that Ive ever seenthats HUGE A developer that actually TRIES to set the example and improve on their product You just dont see this type of response at all from an indieor AAA teamwith dinosaurs Only the quality of the game is far superior being on the Unreal 4 engine The fps numbers may be pretty low for most users but chock that up to poor optimization which is expected of an Early Access title only a few days into releaseyou cant go wrong picking this title up at this point Just make sure your system requirements meet the recommended and you should be fineI absolutely love this game  It encompasses all that I can expect of a survival game  check out my hours and you will know how much I love this game I recently experienced the tek cave and the overseer and that was amazing   Im  62 years old and so farI plan on playing this game till I am no longer able to do so and then ascend to the great Ark in the Sky  Of courseI would highly recommend this game to anyone that is not afraid to play the most awesome game everAfter many have triedStudio Wildcards and associate devstudios are trying to finally deliver us what we have all been craving for A survival game with dinosaurs ARK Survival Evolved is pretty much exactly thatwith an added twist of some unexplained scifi elements that all tie surprisingly well into the game But is this Early Access title worth your money and time Can we trust anyone after the Stomping Lands disasterstranded on the eponymous ARKthe island the game takes place on You do get the option to customise your characteralthough like in many other gamesanything but the smack center for most sliders ends up looking ridiculous hugely muscledgiraffenecked dwarf or super tallonyxskinned valkyriebut it is still nice to have the option to go down that path It should be noted at this point that your characters will be serverspecificmeaning you can have one on every servertrue to the survivalgame code You will quickly learn the ways of a huntergathereras your first task will usually be picking berries and collecting stones You can also punch trees to get woodbut doing so will damage you a dig at Minecraft I like to think sothe world of ARK does not try to hide its inhabitants from you Hugeprehistoric beasts roam free over most of the map and there is rarely ever a moment during which you cannot see at least one dinosaur from your location Not all of these creatures are trying to kill youhoweversome just try to live their life in peace They may even fight each otheras the predators hunt for prey and the latter defends itselfin the sea and even the air To help the players deal with these threats and offer some sense of progression at the same timeARK features a levellingsystem You gain XP at a steady rate over timewith a bonus for doing pretty much anything from gathering and killing to crafting and building Levelling up will allow you to increase one of your attributesas well as spend points learning a new craftingblueprint While you are barely able to craft torches and stone tools at the beginning of your adventurelater down the line you may pick up the recipes for weaponsbuildings and more tools to help you survive All blueprints cannot be unlocked until a very high levelso specialising in a select few while working together with other players online can be a huge benefitfor most playersis to build a somewhat selfsufficient base for yourself and your tribe Bases are built using a very simple and easy to understand system of square foundations with snapping walls on their four sides and flat roofs on top Indeedwhoever has played Rust will immediately feel at homeas the whole game plays very much like it This includes players characters falling asleep and remaining in the world whenever their pupeteer disconnectsadding additional treat to potential raiderswho will be able to take all of your characters belongings even when you are not on the server Of coursebuilding a secure base will help combat this threatits general artstyle scifilooking HUD and inventorycharacter screenits graphics looking seriously impressive and the fact that you can tame your very own dinos Instead of killing the giant murdermachines or playersyou can choose to knock them unconscious insteadbeginning a rather lengthy tamingprocess during which you must keep the creature subdued while also feeding it its favoured food Eventuallyit will become your and your tribes companionable to aid you in combatbear your burdens and even be ridden as a personal mount works with flying dinostoo What more needs to be saidreallythe game has had a rather shaky launch into Early Access According to the devsthey did not expect such a large resonance initiallywhich caused most official servers to crack under the pressure and lag Alsothe stunning graphics of ARK come at a price Your hardware will suffer At this point in timeyou need a fairly beefy machine to be able to play ARK at a reasonable framerate The devs are aware of this and are currently working on optimising the game to maximise FPS and minimise lagreally and is in no way reason to give ARK a negative review In factthe devs claim one of the reasons for the current performanceissues to be their initial focus on contentwanting to give players enough things to do ingame for Early Accesswhich I think speaks volumes about the good intentions behind this projecteven for Early Access ARK offers a great deal of content and longevity through its progressionsystem and dinotamingmechanicswith so much more planned for the future The performanceissues are being tackled at the time of me writing this review and some first patches have already been rolled outresulting in some great improvements for a lot of the players I am very much looking forward to see more stuff added to ARK Survival Evolved and I believe the very pleasant developers have the right ideas on how to steer it to successBy now youve probably read enough reviews both positive and negative and still cant decidethen you know a lot of the fun is learning new recipes and exploring and yearning to reach that next tier At x4 xp ratesbefore you finish building your first house youre ready to build a tier 2by the time you finish upgrading the whole house to tier 2youre ready for tier 3 The game developers did a good job of making all the dinos good and useful However someare only really useful at low levels If you level too fast youll never have the joy of that first raptor or parasaur and the upgrade it gives you Not only thatthey added in explorer notes which give you huge xp boosts So its best to save them for laterespecially since you might have a dino you want to levelsuch as baby growth rate and egg incubation ratesevery ten levels you can increase the rate by 1 so at lvl 1 the rate is 1 This should give you a game experience of leveling at a consistent rateeverything is replaceable Remember the 1 rule of Arkuistion The Ark giveth and the Ark taketh away After a thousand hoursyoull still die a lotbut at that point youll know why Just remember when you dieinstead of blaming the game or imaginary bugsthink about what you could have done to prevent ittrikeor anklyo when you first have access Now while you can spend a lot of work to do thatits a lot of work you lose when the dino dies And they always diesee rule 1 Many utlity dinos have their functionality at lvl 1so you can easily tame a lvl 1 dino and get a lot of use For example it can take a hour to harvest enough berries by hand to tame a high level trikebut like ten minutes to get enough to tame a lvl 4 trikeand that level 4 trike can harvest hundreds of berries in ten minutes A level 4 quetzl can be equipped with a platform saddle that can make taming a max level one even easier than taming the first level 4 oneI suggest you instead increase food consumption rates I put my consumption rates at x3that way feeding my dinos is actually something I have to think about x1 means feeding dinos is pretty meaninglessit also means kibble is important If you increase taming rates you will end up making kibble meaningless which means youve eliminated an aspect of the gameI suggest getting a private server Between the two of youyou can get every engram recipe pretty easily  You should be able to accomplish anything as a duo After 2k hoursyou can easily solo stuff with enough planningbe emotionally prepared to lose it I dont use dinos I care about until Ive made a back up egg ii Dont double down unless youre ready for the loss All that gear you lost when you died is replaceablesure you can try to go back and get it but now youre doing so with less gear I keep an emergency cabinet with the right amount of armor and supplies to do recovery runsbe prepared to lost that gearbut over time you WILL get better at recovering items iii Fear the swampfear the cavesfear the snow biome thats flavor country Remember rule of Arkuisition 3 everything is disposable your gearyour dinoyour houseyour life refer to rule 1 iv You will lose some dinos you are trying to tame A raptors favorite food is tames However you can hedge your bets and avoid getting Arked if you wall off your tame with spiked wallsclear the areayou can even clear trees to increase your line of sight Be paranoid and watch the skies for Argentavis who might like a nip at sleeping beautyThis game has taken my life I feed my dinos more than my own kids My wife has left megotta remove her from the tribe

1,My wife  I enjoy this game together  We love the cooperative clean fun  challenges  She doesnt have a lot of mobility because of a rare disease so this is a way for us to get out  Thank youI bought

anywaysThis is a review of the offline gamewe ran around killing everything After about 3 mins of running and killing things I decided to go home and give my new buddy a rest We ran through the night

will spend countless hours with these people farming materialstaming dinosaursand build bases  You will grow more and more in power  You will be meeting other players either passing through the server or settling down  You will know all the other tribes on the server that are worth knowing ie the big tribes or friendly tribes  You will come across numerous other cultures as you find Chinese tribes and Spanish tribesFrench and Germanall while growing more and more powerful  You will on occassion have a set backbut at this point youre on a roll and now the games mechanicshave a good group of friendsand objectives that you have given yourself  You will feel happy with what you have accomplishedwhile it can be delayed for long periods of timeit will eventually come  And so another tribe will pick a fight with you  Your tribe will fight their tribeand you may lose or you may win  Either way youve invested a lot into this server and these friendsso youll never give up  Some other tribes will jointhe fightpicking sides  The winning side will probably kill all the dinostake all the matsand kill everyone on the losing side  Thus you have won your first war  You are now a power on the server worth being reckoned with  Soon enoughyoull get in an even bigger war as the losing side draws more and more people to aide them and you respond by getting more as well  Now the entire server is split 55and a great war mars the server for days as both sides are constantly wiping one anothers bases  Eventually youll win thoughand the other side will leave the server  Theyll be fed up  As the enemies are now goneyou are happy once more  You hated them just as they hated youa couple weeks  There is trouble brewing as a few of your allies are begin to grow wrestless and have infighting  Peace will try to be maintained through talks  But it will fail in the endand more war will arise  This cycle will continue until only 2 tribes remain  These two tribes will be dominant in every regard leadershiptacticsdinosaursand materials  Pitted against one another to see who will rule the server  You will fight your heart out against your former allies  You will destroy bases youd once entered as a friendnow as an enemy  You will kill dinos whose names you helped come up with  You and your tribemates will be cycling out who gets to sleep because the battle will last over 24 hours  The fight will go on and on and on and on with no end  It will be exhileratingmonths ago when you were just a little tribe starting outwill all be gone  Everyone youd ever fought with and fought against are gone  While there is some joy in victoryit is very bitter as there is no one left to share it with  Your tribemates will still playbut its not the same  Even if not in your tribeyou had a community Friends Foes Maybe even lovers  Now all that is gone  You will pass the ruins of these once great tribes and feel a hole in your heart  New people will always arrive to challenge youbut youll always beat them down  Destroying any hope they had  Youll build fortresses thatll reach the Heavens and have so many dinos itll cause server lag  Youll build Great Walls across vast territories in order to denote your power  Finallyyoull get bored and leaveand one day youll see Ark still in your library and hop back on  Youll log back into your old server  Everything is different  New namesfacesbaseseverything  Not a single structure you had built is left standingnot a single ruin  All of it is gone  The people on this server see you log in and ask if you want to join their tribe saying that Ark can be harsh for noobsbut you could never tell them  You could never tell them an entire servers history  The hundreds of thousands of hours of work youd seen put in by that ancient world  The structures they couldnt ever even imagine  The wars youd fought and people youd met  You could never explain to them what it all had meant to youfor it is all now gone  In its place is a new worldcompletely distinct from the original while maintaining a strong similarity  You will be both extremely happy at this new worldand profoundly sad about the world that was lostno game will ever make you feel as strongly about the decisions youve made than Ark Survival Evolved  Beware that you may get addicted and lose your real social life and ambitions in exchange for this game  But youll meet people youd never have met otherwisesee things you never thought possiblecommit acts that would make tyrants think youre true evil or saints believe you are the second coming of Jesus Christ  In the endyoull feel stronger emotions then any youve ever felt from playing a gameSince most people are bashing the PvP servers for the griefingI feel like someone should answer that and also talk a bit about the PvE serversabout half of that on PvP servers and half of that on PvEall official ones All the thing people say about the griefers is truetheyll kill your dinossteal your stuffabuse your body and destroy your house as soon as you go to sleep In fact a lot of tribes organize group to play past midnight for the sole reason of hunting sleeping players And thats the keyword here TRIBES If youre playing on a PvP server you gotta keep in mind that youre not supposed to do it at your pace and take your time building your little Tatch hut with its little thatch fence with your Raptor and a couple of Dilos Slowly learning the game by yourselftaking everything ineventually upgrading to Wood and then Stone and so forthmaybe even a weekbut alone youre doomed to be foundrobbed and killed And like many others saidhave the work of a whole week go down the drain If youre joining a PvP server youre doing it for Tribe warfare and let me assure youthing can get really intensereally epic pretty fast With eagles swooping down to grab enemies and droping them from high altitues to their deathsor tactical droping Raptors inside their base to wreak havokTRexes working as battering rams at the enemies gates while rockets fly at themautoturrets spewing bullets at your Carno armySabretooths leaping over walls It is a beauty to beholdnothing else Theyll keep you from taming dinos by killing them mid proccessblock caverns so only they can harvest the resourcesliterally kidnap you to use you as a blood bag Mad Max style and so onafter all theyre just being preayed upontheyre not participating in all the fun that is Tribe Wars But the only way to Tribe Wars be so much fun is allowing all this kind of freedom the game has right nowthey gotta allow people to be complete aholes because during wars thats what you gotta be If they put too many safety nets to keep people who wanna do PvP only when THEY wanna do PvP the game would be boring and staledont be First of all because you dont really need PvP for this game to be fun Theres a TON of stuff to do in PvE servers or offline if you just wanna do everything at your pace I got a bit tired of all the pressure on PvP servers and have been playing in a PvE for around 6 hours right now And I still only got only a Wood base with some Dinosjust hit level 45and I feel like Ill never run out of things to do because the devs just keep adding and adding stuff almost each day People are also very helpful on PvE serverstheyll give you a hand when you have problems with a Rexhelp you gather Prime meat when youre taming a Carnivoregive you tips and materials At least on my server I got absolutely nothing to complain about themREJOICE Because theyll soon add War Declaration to PvE serversso tribes can actually go at war when they feel like itwithout all the griefing to new players who want just to keep to themselvesId like to congratulate the Devs Theyre doing a terrific job Optimization is alreayd a LOT betterstill not there yetbut much better The content is fantastic and it just keeps coming Bugs are rarer and rarerin fact I dont even remember the last time I experienced oneand its also pretty cheapH1THIS IS A DAY 1 REVIEW AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS THE DEVELOPMENT CONTINUESH1objectivesetcsome do notthey will own your butt unless you hit a hill or something Not really a Contheyre just dcksbut please keep in mind that this is a VERY Early Access game despite the fact that there is a lot about it that simply looksand somewhat feelspolished the dinosaurs are amazing If you cannot or do not want to deal with the current CONS then you should wait at least a week and come back and check out the changes the Devs push otherwise Im saying go ahead and drop the 2489USD and try your hand at playingh1├Professors Review┤h1to rocket launchersand turretskilling you upon spawnBut rememeber that the game is still in bALPHA STAGESb It still has a ways to go before it finishedbut it is headed in the right direction It gets your heart pumping when you have a lot to loseand you got a giant dinosaur chasing you down through a forestconsider giving it a thumbs upiand they think they are bringing some sort of new information to everyone by saying ityou can tell its not fakeFirst review i wrote for a game but it had to be doneA nearby chinese tribe gave us some stuff to start out and we were hooked to the game pretty much instantly There were some big tribe wars going on on the server but we were left alonecarrying heavy loadstransportationcombatyou name it and we eventually also tamed a few trexes and the stronger end game dinos You name them all and because of their different tasks and stat builds you become sort of attached to your dinos as well which makes the game even betterDestroyed usarrows and food and approached their base The chinese built a enormous stone castle on the water where they stored most of their Egg farm dinos in I went to the beach swam underneath the base found a spot where i could hack away at their stone walls to get inside Found a good spot and made a start tribe members brought over grenades and we blew though the wall Out came charging a Trex and 5 raptors at insane speed we started backing off while firing at them The water slowed them down Called for the rest of the tribe to head over we ended up fighting them on foot with primitive weapons After a long fight we took them out one by one and eventually they all lay dead That feeling of Vengeance is undescribable but we werent satisfied We headed back into the dino pen and laid waste to their entire egg farmwe killed over 2 Stegos three mammoths and a few ankylosIt was a massacre Fueled by the loss of our pets and friendsAfter a few hours playing i just felt i had to type down something about the game First off the game looks realy niceno way i could say it was a early access game if i didnt know it alrdy No major game breaking buggs so farsome bigger dinos stuck between trees but so far i just seen a handfull of themi legged back to the beach where i woke upfish should be easy food to catchI swam out to a big boulder just where the sea got alittle deeperspotting a fish getting rdy to jump into the water and spearing it i saw a big shadow comming closer a shark the size of 2 carsMy dino i came to call Fido was defending me and the house without mercy Oneday i felt the gound shake as a pack of big herbivores deciced that my house was totaly in the wrong place and started to attack it Fido the good guard dog as he was attacked without delay Outnumberd and outpowerd we fought them side by side for almost 3 min killing off 6 of the 8 attackers when Fido didnt have anymore fight in him and fell to the ground to never raise again I without any backup was no match for the remaining two and i had to fall back into my house and gather as mutch of my resources i could carry and the flee The only thing i could do was to watch from afar with my spyglass the destruction of my house and mourn the death of my brave FidoThis is a review of the offline gamewe ran around killing everything After about 3 mins of running and killing things I decided to go home and give my new buddy a rest We ran through the night and in the morning i realised how extra lost i was and got worried I decided that the best way to find my way home was to climb a mountain and look around After 5 mins or so of looking and referencing the map I finally figured out where we were Just as I was about to put my map away I was ambushed by several scorpions and unfortunately they killed meArk is easily my favorite game Ive every played It goes so deep The gameplay is super fun but also unfair at times You are weak at first and dinosaurs are strong and merciless Expect to die you dont really lose anything when you die as long as you go and get your stuffthough your tamed dinosaurs die permanentlyI couldnt recommend this game morethe official servers seem depressing because you constantly get raided by other players Our personal server is hosted on Nitrado Nitrados service totally stinks to set upbut works great after its up and running We adjusted the settings to make breeding go faster and animals eat lessbut other than that we basically play vanilla Ark with the two of us in our own worldI loved coplaying Minecraft and Diablo 3I have over 5 hours into the gamecompared to a lot of ARK players im still a noobso if you arent ready to turn this into a full time jobdont even bother thinking about getting this game Ill explain why this game is a full time job later onbut basically it punishes any player that cant or wont play it 247the biggest and in my opinion the coolest of the three maps The beginning is the hardest part for new players Every dino you meet can easily kill a noobeven the spitter dinos It can be annoying running around naked and getting killed by raptorsbut stick with it and find your friends and build a safe place Once you get the base builtthe game gets so much more fun Every new dino you find is cooland it so fun the first time you get all your friends together and explore a cave The most dangerous foes we encountered in PvE were the alpha predators Our base got destroyed multiple times by alpha raptorsbut it was fun because it showed us that even though we had a big base with spike walls and guard towersthere was still a threat out there that had to be beaten Of course once you build a metal base nothing can break it anymoreand once you tame flying mounts you dont have to worry about dangerous expeditions so late game it got boring We basically got to the point that nothing PvE had to throw at us outside of boss battles was a challengeand even fighting bosses had no point because what would we use the tek gear to kill Harder versions of that boss Thats why we decided to turn to PvP to see if that was better late gamedont PvP This game is designed in such a way that the big tribes that are on top stay on top New tribes and new players just get pooped on in every single way unless they join an alpha and become a resource harvesting slave Lets walk through all the reason PvP is horriblethey wont let anyone else even enjoy the gameyou dont get a basethey might let you live in a thatch hut Refer to reason 1you dont get to tame dinosthey might let you tame dodos Refer to reason 1you dont get to upgrade any of your gear Alphas block all loot drops the good ones anyway and fill all the caves with autoturrets to gun down anyone that tries to explore themand you wont get close enough to plant c4 You wont be able to bring dinos to tank the turrets eitherrefer to 1you dont get to save any of your dinosyou dont even get to fight backits all just gone This happens all the timeand honestly offlineraid protection should be baseline on all serverssleep or work or whateverthen they will know and they will raid you They can even get text alerts that tell them the second you have logged off or onor if anything else unusual is going on on their server Basicallythis site and sites like it are cancer Alsoit doesnt tell them your in game namebut your steam namethat means even if you make another character they will know its you Alsoif you piss them off and try to go to another serverthey can just look up where you went using Battlemetrics and come find you There is no hiding and no escapeso you have to be nice and cant even PvP or else some loser with no life is going to come and find you on every single server you go to If you run into anyone named 123 and a private profileBEWAREeach hatched dino is gonna be 2x the level of anything a noob will haveif the fact that they have 23x better dinos by building huge breeding rooms wasnt a big enough edgenow they get tek gear too If they come at you with anything tek and you have baseline gear and baseline dinosyou are DEADand you must grind harder than everyone else to make sure you have the defenses and dinos to stop raiders Dont botheryou wontIm tired of typing this reviewjust know that if you enjoy PvP because you enjoy winning through skillthen dont PvP No PvP skill is required at this pointtheir gear will have much higher armor and damagetheir dinos will have much higher hp and damagejust accept your death and wipe multiple times because you will lose everything and you wont even be online to defend itnot like youd have a chance even if you werebut now that it is I feel like I should address all the kids telling me I suck and that Im still a noob who doesnt know what hes talking aboutthis is NOT a skill based game This is a grind basedoffline raid basedexploit based game You cant come here and say Im a noobespecially when Ive played the game solo and as a small tribe for over 3 hoursand I joined an alpha tribe for a week or two so I know how it goes on a larger scale My opinion actually got even worse after joining the alpha tribe because I realized just how bad the game panders to them Here are some more reasons why I will never recommend this game to anyone that I found from my time with the alphasyou would probably expect this After allthey have more players so it is only natural that they could send 5 out to grind while your tribe could only spare 1 Nonumbers isnt even what Im talking about hereIm talking about EXPLOITS with a farming dino and a Quetzal A noob with a hatchet can get 56 wood from a single tree An alpha tribe can get 15 wood from a single tree A noob with a pickaxe can get 56 metal from a veinan alpha tribe can get 3 metal from a vein A noob would take hours to farm 12k metalan alpha tribe can farm 23k metal in an hour The list goes on and every single resource you can think of they can get insane amounts much faster and easier Nownoobs wont know how to do thisand wouldnt be able to because Quetzals are hard to tameand hard to hide from alpha tribes If they saw you flying around harvestingthey would bring a Wyvern after you and start looking for your basebut if you get more than 2 players in a serverthe lag becomes unbearable Once againalpha tribes exploit this by logging as many people as they can onto a server kind of like DDOS to block out defenders from connectingor to force the server to get so laggy that you can basically avoid taking damage from thingsIm at a point where Im about to hit 2 solid hours of gaming and feel I have a good enough grasp of the game to review it So here goesGoGetcthis is an Early Access title So of course the launch was plagued with issuesand the server numbers didnt cover the 1 players BUTthe devs have made some of the most aggressive moves to resolve the issues that Ive ever seenthats HUGE A developer that actually TRIES to set the example and improve on their product You just dont see this type of response at all from an indieor AAA teamwith dinosaurs Only the quality of the game is far superior being on the Unreal 4 engine The fps numbers may be pretty low for most users but chock that up to poor optimization which is expected of an Early Access title only a few days into releaseyou cant go wrong picking this title up at this point Just make sure your system requirements meet the recommended and you should be fineI absolutely love this game  It encompasses all that I can expect of a survival game  check out my hours and you will know how much I love this game I recently experienced the tek cave and the overseer and that was amazing   Im  62 years old and so farI plan on playing this game till I am no longer able to do so and then ascend to the great Ark in the Sky  Of courseI would highly recommend this game to anyone that is not afraid to play the most awesome game everAfter many have triedStudio Wildcards and associate devstudios are trying to finally deliver us what we have all been craving for A survival game with dinosaurs ARK Survival Evolved is pretty much exactly thatwith an added twist of some unexplained scifi elements that all tie surprisingly well into the game But is this Early Access title worth your money and time Can we trust anyone after the Stomping Lands disasterstranded on the eponymous ARKthe island the game takes place on You do get the option to customise your characteralthough like in many other gamesanything but the smack center for most sliders ends up looking ridiculous hugely muscledgiraffenecked dwarf or super tallonyxskinned valkyriebut it is still nice to have the option to go down that path It should be noted at this point that your characters will be serverspecificmeaning you can have one on every servertrue to the survivalgame code You will quickly learn the ways of a huntergathereras your first task will usually be picking berries and collecting stones You can also punch trees to get woodbut doing so will damage you a dig at Minecraft I like to think sothe world of ARK does not try to hide its inhabitants from you Hugeprehistoric beasts roam free over most of the map and there is rarely ever a moment during which you cannot see at least one dinosaur from your location Not all of these creatures are trying to kill youhoweversome just try to live their life in peace They may even fight each otheras the predators hunt for prey and the latter defends itselfin the sea and even the air To help the players deal with these threats and offer some sense of progression at the same timeARK features a levellingsystem You gain XP at a steady rate over timewith a bonus for doing pretty much anything from gathering and killing to crafting and building Levelling up will allow you to increase one of your attributesas well as spend points learning a new craftingblueprint While you are barely able to craft torches and stone tools at the beginning of your adventurelater down the line you may pick up the recipes for weaponsbuildings and more tools to help you survive All blueprints cannot be unlocked until a very high levelso specialising in a select few while working together with other players online can be a huge benefitfor most playersis to build a somewhat selfsufficient base for yourself and your tribe Bases are built using a very simple and easy to understand system of square foundations with snapping walls on their four sides and flat roofs on top Indeedwhoever has played Rust will immediately feel at homeas the whole game plays very much like it This includes players characters falling asleep and remaining in the world whenever their pupeteer disconnectsadding additional treat to potential raiderswho will be able to take all of your characters belongings even when you are not on the server Of coursebuilding a secure base will help combat this threatits general artstyle scifilooking HUD and inventorycharacter screenits graphics looking seriously impressive and the fact that you can tame your very own dinos Instead of killing the giant murdermachines or playersyou can choose to knock them unconscious insteadbeginning a rather lengthy tamingprocess during which you must keep the creature subdued while also feeding it its favoured food Eventuallyit will become your and your tribes companionable to aid you in combatbear your burdens and even be ridden as a personal mount works with flying dinostoo What more needs to be saidreallythe game has had a rather shaky launch into Early Access According to the devsthey did not expect such a large resonance initiallywhich caused most official servers to crack under the pressure and lag Alsothe stunning graphics of ARK come at a price Your hardware will suffer At this point in timeyou need a fairly beefy machine to be able to play ARK at a reasonable framerate The devs are aware of this and are currently working on optimising the game to maximise FPS and minimise lagreally and is in no way reason to give ARK a negative review In factthe devs claim one of the reasons for the current performanceissues to be their initial focus on contentwanting to give players enough things to do ingame for Early Accesswhich I think speaks volumes about the good intentions behind this projecteven for Early Access ARK offers a great deal of content and longevity through its progressionsystem and dinotamingmechanicswith so much more planned for the future The performanceissues are being tackled at the time of me writing this review and some first patches have already been rolled outresulting in some great improvements for a lot of the players I am very much looking forward to see more stuff added to ARK Survival Evolved and I believe the very pleasant developers have the right ideas on how to steer it to successBy now youve probably read enough reviews both positive and negative and still cant decidethen you know a lot of the fun is learning new recipes and exploring and yearning to reach that next tier At x4 xp ratesbefore you finish building your first house youre ready to build a tier 2by the time you finish upgrading the whole house to tier 2youre ready for tier 3 The game developers did a good job of making all the dinos good and useful However someare only really useful at low levels If you level too fast youll never have the joy of that first raptor or parasaur and the upgrade it gives you Not only thatthey added in explorer notes which give you huge xp boosts So its best to save them for laterespecially since you might have a dino you want to levelsuch as baby growth rate and egg incubation ratesevery ten levels you can increase the rate by 1 so at lvl 1 the rate is 1 This should give you a game experience of leveling at a consistent rateeverything is replaceable Remember the 1 rule of Arkuistion The Ark giveth and the Ark taketh away After a thousand hoursyoull still die a lotbut at that point youll know why Just remember when you dieinstead of blaming the game or imaginary bugsthink about what you could have done to prevent ittrikeor anklyo when you first have access Now while you can spend a lot of work to do thatits a lot of work you lose when the dino dies And they always diesee rule 1 Many utlity dinos have their functionality at lvl 1so you can easily tame a lvl 1 dino and get a lot of use For example it can take a hour to harvest enough berries by hand to tame a high level trikebut like ten minutes to get enough to tame a lvl 4 trikeand that level 4 trike can harvest hundreds of berries in ten minutes A level 4 quetzl can be equipped with a platform saddle that can make taming a max level one even easier than taming the first level 4 oneI suggest you instead increase food consumption rates I put my consumption rates at x3that way feeding my dinos is actually something I have to think about x1 means feeding dinos is pretty meaninglessit also means kibble is important If you increase taming rates you will end up making kibble meaningless which means youve eliminated an aspect of the gameI suggest getting a private server Between the two of youyou can get every engram recipe pretty easily  You should be able to accomplish anything as a duo After 2k hoursyou can easily solo stuff with enough planningbe emotionally prepared to lose it I dont use dinos I care about until Ive made a back up egg ii Dont double down unless youre ready for the loss All that gear you lost when you died is replaceablesure you can try to go back and get it but now youre doing so with less gear I keep an emergency cabinet with the right amount of armor and supplies to do recovery runsbe prepared to lost that gearbut over time you WILL get better at recovering items iii Fear the swampfear the cavesfear the snow biome thats flavor country Remember rule of Arkuisition 3 everything is disposable your gearyour dinoyour houseyour life refer to rule 1 iv You will lose some dinos you are trying to tame A raptors favorite food is tames However you can hedge your bets and avoid getting Arked if you wall off your tame with spiked wallsclear the areayou can even clear trees to increase your line of sight Be paranoid and watch the skies for Argentavis who might like a nip at sleeping beautyThis game has taken my life I feed my dinos more than my own kids My wife has left megotta remove her from the tribe

1,Lookyou can just see how much Ive played this game to know that I like it Its a good game with a great free trial you can play if you want to get a feel for it Youve probably heard it all before from word of mouth so Im not going to try and sell it for you here just know that its really goodand maybe the most important If you buy the game on steam you can only buy the steam version of the expansionthere are two types of subscriptions Entry and Standard subscriptions are differentstartingis 199 USD This one has 8 charcters per sever with a total of 0 overall With a standard subscription you also have the option to purchase multiple months at a time This can save you money in the long run especially if you are really into the gamefor those who are used to WoW You can play every classand every jobon one characteryou can play anything you want when you want to If a new class comes out you only have to be at the level the class requiresyou dont have to create a whole new character for it This was a big draw for me as swapping characters all the time was a real pain Yes theres still some grinding involved as youll have to level up that class as well nowbut you dont have to always start from square one If anyone who used to play wow is reading thisname changes and race changes are also way cheaper from what I remember them being in WoW A name change is 10 USD on here and a Fantasiawhich is a way to completely makeover your character changingracegenderand nearly everything else save the nameis also 10 USD but can also be bought in packs of 3 or 5 that can save you some moneyoff the top of my headthat can help people new to the game If youre reading this I hope you have fun at least trying it outRegistering your account is the hardest quest so farSo I have bought this game on 052517 and have been only playing this game till 0602017 with an accumulate of 139 hoursChocobo and Chocobo racingis that in FFXIVthere is no rush in this game You can be what you want to be and you are not forced to do anything elsethere are TrialsExtreme which increases the difficulties making it twice as hardyou are in a party of 8 of what you do is important Everyone has to work together and synchronize too be able clear this content The amount of time varies but in the most extreme hardcore raiders it can take them a 57 days to clear but for normal players it can take them 23 weeks  There is also a 8 man savage content that released in the Eureka contentthere is always a new mechanic that is very unique This type of content take up to possibly more than 60 hours Being it can take you more than 13 months just to clear 1 ultimate Though yes its hard But that is what makes this so much fun The reward is that you will get a ultimate title and a unique ultimate weapon But its worth itdungeons or crafting Every gear in this game unique There are people who actually farm gear just for glamour that just looks really cool too be being very gorgeous or just very funny Tanks3Healers7 Craftersand 3 Gathers Each job is very unique in terms of playstyle You can be good with a specific class But you will see a huge difference in terms of skill of the class you play too someone who plays the same class as you This means even though you know your class You havent mastered it being there are rotationsif you do buy the steam versionyou can purchase subscription with steam credits But this is how the game is still alive and healthyFinal Fantasy 1 feels like the MMO that filled the void of my heart from what an MMO should beI feel like I can write at least a small review with 5 thousand hours in the game so here we gothe best mmo in my opinion out there Good musicdungeonsstory and awesome community Rocky start but starts to get better after the first expansionthe base game you get is easily the longest and grueling at times Quests that make you go fetch things from A to Btalk to this person etc Howeverit still has some good pointsHealer or DPS

you start the Heavensward expansion but start at a lower level than its entry levelespecially if you enjoy multitaskingHeavensward will leave you very satisfied with how the game evolved But it does

question yourself if you are in a battle of life or death or at an operaconcert Many fall in love with the music in it and choose to do content because of it Myself includedthe reason behind this big point that has been brought so many times is because we choose to be kind because the developers are also kind Its a paying forward sort of deal At least that is how I see itthank you for your time I hope this review will be at least helpful in getting an image on how the game is like and if you want to try it Hope to see you lads and lasses in the game And most importantlyhave an awesome dayPlayed WoW for 16 years or so Switched to FF finally been playing past couple days nonstop Dont regret a single minute of it Cant wait to start the actual expansions though Already recommended to all of my friends that play WoWI play MMOs Its my thing Its what I like to do Ive tried many Most disappoint me This one did notas you can probably tell by my everincreasing total playtimeto many peoples annoyanceis bWorld of Warcraftb WoW They are both theme park style MMOsand they both use simpleactionbasedTABtargeting combat The similarities are vastI can assure youbut they are also obvious I can split hairstalk about WoWs reactivefast paced style versus FF1s slowprepared stylebut to anyone who has played both at the higher levelsits fairly selfevident The games are very similar as massively multiplayer online roleplaying gameswith simple mechanics and easytoenter natures as well as raised costofentriesI watched every cutsceneI leveled a healertank and a dps to 80 the current maxand I gathered and crafted for way too longin that they are as helpful as they are awkward People will gladly help you for nothingthen ask that you visit them in their home which is often just a hot tub next to a bed They have odd customslike saying o7 at the start of dungeons which is supposed to be a salute Everyone cares how they lookbut doesnt care what you think about how they look Playing songs in the plazaserotic roleplay in the alleysand bots asking you to buy gil are common sightssplit by expansion You have to play through ball the present and past storyb to catch up This is iincrediblyi time consuming If you play like I did over the last yearit is unlikely you can get to Shadowbringers the current expansion within one month of game time Luckilybthe free trial is extremely good nowb They recently changed it to be that you can play through the initial release content A Realm Rebornall for freeforeverits painfully average The story is as well paced as paint dryingand because of the way itemlevel scaling worksthere is no meaningful challenges Grantedthere arent isupposedi to bebut it is disappointing The plot comes to a grinding halt a number of timesand sometimes there isnt even a plotjust you doing weirdforgettable jobs for weirdforgettable people If you tried this game and left because of how slow ARR isI cant blame you Its a slog But if you stick aroundbthe last arcb of ARR was relatively enjoyablefinally arriving at some of the crazy style Final Fantasy is more known forand after you pay for the gamecomes bHeavenswardb HWthe Wrath of the Lich King of this game I cannot express to you how surprised I was by the sharp quality increase here Its remarkable The story picks up in a new kingdomdropping most of the old characters for a story about an oncoming dragon warset in a genuinely interesting nation The first time I truly took notice of the music in FF1 was when I entered this expansionits phenomenaland consistently so throughout The quests become stripped of tedious Slay 10 and are paced very wellkeeping a feeling of tension as you progress that was never present in ARR If youve ever heard someone say stick around FF1it gets goodthis is why Unfortunatelyit is followed bythen Stormblood is like Warlords of Draenor Everything I just praised HW for took several steps back during this story Old characters are brought to the light screaming and kickingsome given literal rewrites to force them to fit inand newer characters struggle to make an impact The music fails to keep me engaged as wellmatching equally uninteresting environments Plots are jumpstartedthen the brakes are cut as they tumble down a hill While the questing is still better than ARRits not by much anymore The truly cool moments are so few and far between a deepdeep ocean of truly unfulfilling questing Its really unfortunateI really liked a few of the characters they introduce hereand 2 of the zones they introduce are among the best the game haswith a small plot about a rebellion I truly enjoyed Those aspects are just mashed inside of a largermore boring plot about a different rebellionbShadowbringersb ShB was everything I hoped for If HW is WotLKand SB is WoDthan Shadowbringers isI guesskind of like Legion Honestlythe WoW expansion comparisons start to break down here If you are looking into this gameat some point you probably heard that Shadowbringers is good You probably also have some healthy skepticism and some tempered expectations Im here to assure you that Shadowbringers is not so good that its worth playing through all of what I just describedAND a 60 price tag But its pretty close This expansions reworks a lot of old characters and plots into a surprisingly touching and insightful storymaking one of the most trite and lifeless antagonistic forces in the game into strangely sympathetic villains The themes through the story are strongand conveyed in honestly intuitive ways bThe musicb is unbelievably good One or two areas have some weaker themesbut the urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvAG5qx583Uysdungeonsurl and raids have absolutely stunning scores The area designs are lackingin my opinionbut they are easy to traverseandwellits very subjectiveorganized in no particular orderand the meta is tightwithand I know this is hard to believeevery class performing well Its very well balanced on the PvE sideand this is being generousiawfuli Its poorly balancedits map design is shoddyand its not very rewarding in terms of character progressionif at all It can be fun in short doses because it is chaoticbut playing it anymore than that is frustratingand there is a wide variety of styles to pursuealso known as the Mogstationis quite prevalent Not in the sense that you are forced to visit itor that you have to to get an advantagejust that manymany people use it Premium costumes and emotes are frequentas well as sales It doesnt bother me muchbut I mention it because it can be annoying to see someone wearing a cool setonly to discover it cost them 12slowand prone to problems The bcustomer supportb as well is slowbut I have found them to be at the very least helpful and patient AlsoI find Final Fantasy XIV a rewarding way to waste my time I often find myself just standing in placestalking with my friends andor strangers I happen to meet ingame I recommend this to anyone who wants a relaxed MMO with a flair for the dramatich1 Sum uph1even without the expansions Up to 2000 hours easilylooks appealing and raises the difficulty in later levelsbosses and raids look amazingfeaturing rich details and lots of effectsas well as other features to keep players together and make it easy to connectthough it gets much betterit becomes a trial and error experience when battling new bosses and exploring new dungeonsthat its system is easy to learn but hard to master and that it has a lot of versatility when it comes to its players It is a fluid system with a good amount of room to explore and take it easyonce they do they are able to queue up for dungeonstrialsbosses and raids which they can battle together with friends or with other players through the party finderwhich works like a charmthen at lv 30that class will become a job Job is a more specialized class Depending on the class the player choosesgameplay will vary and while it would be impossible to mention all of them in a reviewI will give some examples Classes are divided into three rolesto a more offensive approach with the scholar who has damaging spells Players can also opt to get a mix of both with astrologianwhich depends on the high skill of the player and some RGN but features the higher arrange of abilitieswhich enjoy lots of damaging spells but lack utilityto bards who can buff their whole party with beneficial effects while keeping up damage or ninjaswho mix different kinds of abilities to generate powerful ninjutsuthey always must protect their fragile party members and be the shield that guards the realm of men Like their description saysthey keep everyone out of harms way by provoking monsterrushing to deploy barriers or just being a pain for bosses to get rid of in general Tanks will redirect all the damage towards them so that the healers and dps’s can do their jobs without preoccupying about dyingand with the finderyou are always guaranteed to get a good balance of all of them Each of these roles is equally important as they are pieces of a greater whole The healers keep everyone alivethe DPS kills the enemies and the tanks keep the other two out of harms way No matter which role you chooseyou will always be important for your partythere is another type of roles I haven’t mentioned yet These are the disciples of the hand and the disciples of the hand In these fieldsplayers can find classes ranging from blacksmiths to fishermen or even culinarian These jobs tend to break the normal pace of the game and offer a more relaxing environment They might sound boring at firstbut players often find themselves lost in them for hours Once you get goingyou just want to do moreand they are beneficial to yourself and your other classesfor exampleyou can make your own food which allows you to get bonus exp modifiers If you are a blacksmith or an armoreryou can craft your own weapons and armors to use in your other classes If you are a fishermanyou can sell the fish for lots of money on the player market and wellwho doesn’t love fishing in a gameunfortunatelybut these are quite enjoyablefilled with lots of believable charactersconflictsdevelopment and moreso if you are not into spending a lot of time readingwatching cutscenesyou can always skip them and rewatch them later at an inn’s room There are also plenty of summaries only that are well written and consist of thirty to an hour reading material per expansion game2 expansions 3 hours of reading total so feel free to skip it if you do find it boring or exhausting to sit through Do however note that the story is one of the strongest points of the gamethis is not a big issue by any means Duties can be bothersome when you are at a party with friends but are overall enjoyable Probably the easiest MMO to get into has a UI that the player can adjust to fit their playstyle or needs and the game lacks any sort of pay to win or ingame advantage bought with real moneyonly shortcuts for those that simply don’t have a lot of timefluent system with that is easy to use but hard to master By sharing all classes across one characterthe player will never need to go back to the start of the game in they decide that maybe that class they pickedin the beginningwasn’t the one for themgetting devours by a Cerberus and fighting the beast from its stomach or even getting split from their bodies and have to move across a labyrinth of AOE’s in order to go back into them and continue the fight There is always something new in waiting for the player in the next encounterit is filled with great amounts of content and different ice breakers to teach new players how to play and hold their hands until they can go by themselves into the wild worlds of Eorzea There are a bunch of side activities to break the normal pace of the game and have some fun if you are ever tired from questingand each dungeon or trial keep adding new mechanicskeeping the game entertaining and making you wonder what you will encounter in your next adventure I recommend this game to those that haven’t experienced an MMOand to those that have as wellb Alexanders Club Curationsb if you like and want to see more reviews like this oneurlquoteIts important to know what this MMO is and isntgenerally speakingtheres only one right way to play a given class It bisntb some emergent life simulator where player actions directly influence some sprawlingcontinuous overworld Everything in the game is instancedarguably including the overworld which is broken up into several load zonesyoull enjoy the games great presentationmusicand writing Once you reach the endgamethe combat ifinallyi meets its potential with harder content in the form of extreme trials and savage raidsGraphicsThis game is really goodbut you dont have to take my word for itwanna play it just download the free trial from the square enix page You will need an square enix account to play it anywaysyou can play the game with little to no changes for free up to level 60 that´s like a lot of content my dudesbase game  one expansionthats easy 100 hs of content If by that time you dont like itdont buy it Risk freeno moneycredit card asked in advance and you can migrate your free trial character to your paid game in less than a five minutesIm incredibly happy to see the injection of new players after WoW shat the bed with Shadowlands and 91 I played WoW for nearly a decade of my life and through every expansion to endgameand I have to say that Blizzard doesnt hold a candle to ANYTHING Square Enix has pushed out for FFXIV Allow me to explainstarting with the cons of FFXIVthis isnt necessarily a negativebut some might think soand almost all of it is good howeversome expansions are better than others and each have their own theme and build off of each other ARR vanilla is arguably the worstbut begins to pick up about halfway throughand the rest of the expansions are excellent with Shadowbringers being one of the best narratives Ive seen in an MMORPGthen you can buy thesethe game functions just fine without themb BUY SHADOWBRINGERS BEFORE BUYING ENDWALKER IF YOU BUY ENDWALKER EXPECTING TO HAVE EVERYTHING ELSEYOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY THE CURRENTLY RELEASED CONTENT UNTIL ENDWALKER RELEASES bIve played WoW for yearsand the following game mechanics and features completely outstrip WoW in terms of functionality and enjoymentjobs and you can switch between them with literally a click of your mouse b This game respects your time immensely Tired of playing the ArcherBard No problem Switch on over to your GladiatorPaladin and nothing changes except your class Not only thatbut classes receive something called an Armory Bonus that increases experience gained up to your maximum leveled classlike basic defensives or casting modifiersmostly in the form of Beast Tribe dailies You can do 12 of these a dayand they reward you with unique currency that you can spend at the factions along with reputation It might sound like a small amount of dailiesbut the reputation gain is proportional And better yetflying isnt gated behind getting reputation with these factions thank god The reason this is a pro is due to the fact that it holds no bearing on anything else in the game and nothing is locked behind it other than factionspecific mounts and pets and whatnotand they give you veteran rewards every few months that youre subscribedbut thats not really the focus of the gear gameespecially at end game content Many duties FFXIVs equivalent to dungeons and raids will reward you with both random drops and tokens or currency to trade in for b specific b pieces of gear This means you dont have to grind the same raid or trial for the specific drop for weeksand instead just buy an equivalent piece insteadlike arbitrarily more health or damage Insteadbosses rely on complex and interesting mechanics SavageExtremeUnrealand Ultimate boss fights will also scale with health and damage and will require a certain DPS checkbut when youre doing these you know what youre in for and what is requiredand many bosses also have unique soundtracks and battle music Honestlymost of it is top tier musicall the way back to 20 ARR vanillatrialor raidand many have dyeable versions that can be crafted Im looking at youWoWwith your reskinned gear sets from every dungeon in an expansion Most harder difficulty content of the same duty rewards equipment that looks completely different from the previous difficultyor they follow a certain theme Regardlessthe equipment will look different and rarely is it recoloredor even days Almost all of them can be completed in less than an hourand if youre there for more than an hour then youre doing something very very wrongbut the game incentivizes you to use the crafting abilities to make highquality craftables In factit gives you the option to craft it quickly or take your time to really get that good good There are also a few different types of crafting activities that involve items that are classified as collectables and reward special currency for nifty mountsminions petsand cosmeticsbut go see for yourself The free trial includes ARR and the awardwinning Heavensward expansion up to level 60 with no restrictions to the amount of time played There arehoweversome restrictions regarding social functions and ingame marketboard stuffAn MMO you can play soloat your own pacewithout rat racing to level up with everyone else just to get to the good part This is a working mans MMO The kind of MMO you can play for a few hours a dayor even a few hours a weekand enjoy Story is amazingcombat starts a little slow but gets very in depth around level 15 And the best part about this game is the fact that it is an MMOso if you want to play with friends and go through instanced dungeons without the obligation of be here at this time ready to go then you can I can see why this game blew up in popularity It wasnt because of Asmongold or the Blizzard lawsuit Its because this game is for everyonethe community is amazing for the most partand there has never been a more in depth and appealing MMO for the casual crowd than this MMO Square Enix nailed it with this  one Play ityou wont regret it 75 of the game can be played freeand if you enjoy A Realm Reborn and Heavensward then you can sub and buy the other expansions I know I will beand I work 0 hours a week and have a family as well Its worth every single pennyEdit TLDRdefinitely worth checking out One characterALL content including classesjobs etc BASE GAME AND FIRST EXPANSION ARE NOW FREE TO PLAYwith some restrictionsyou can make your own food and you can play 95 of the game ALL BY YOURSELF You dont have to be in a guild or part of a clique The people who play

share in the recruit a friend benefitsmessage meand doing everything short of Savage contentI have to say that I never thought I would play a game that would tug my heart strings so much again But this game The most recent MSQ line just keeps the punches coming It was amazinghave logged another 1000 hours and am almost endgame againI was not thrilled with Stormblood but Shadowbringers is amazing so faryou must give this one at least a one month strikeor 1daystrike trial now goes up to heavensward contentsee below trial periodthe free trial is now available all the way up through level 60 and the first expansion Heavensward Im not sure how long the trial lastsbut it free to anyone and now is the best time to jump in Exp has been increasedMain Storyline Quests have been optimized and new Jobs have been addednow that I have finished MSQ for Shadowbringersplease dont level skip If you doplease at least go back and learn basics If youre not interested in the storyfine but dont let that stop you from being the best you can be at your chosen role Thank you in advance100 hours in free trial and 69 hours  ͡• ͜ʖ ͡•  in full versionI highly recommend this game for MMO RPG players18

master all classes and jobs in single character and level them all to the max level 80 for nowit got the calmingthe excitingthe sadthe FUNNY one of the major things that got me hooked into playing and buying the game is soundtrackplease let me know if i said something wrong in the comments 3 I might edit the review later when i have 100000000 hours and give you the sad version of how MMO games ruined my life Until then stay safeFor a long timeI avoided FF1 even as word continued on that it was one of the best MMOs  currently out there This only increased with the release of the Shadowbringers Expansionwhich I heard nothing but good things about Stillthis was not enough Knowing how I operate in MMOsstarting one would be a colossal time investment for monthsand possibly years depending upon how much I enjoyed it I ended up giving FF1 a try when I saw how many of my oldest friends were either playing it or planning to They let you do a free trial up to level 35so I figured why not If I make it that far and like itthen perhaps this may be worth buyingI wasnt quite prepared for how much I was about to be consumed by this game FF1 is easily the best MMO ive played since WoWs Wrath of the Lich King expansion more than 10 years ago I found it to be more enjoyable than EVE and Guild Wars 2and far superior to WoWs current expansion Battle for Azeroth After over a year of enduring that messit was refreshing to play FF1 and find an MMO that I actually could enjoy without excessive RNG and obnoxious busyworkso reviewing an MMO in its entirety is utterly mad and id be here for hoursso instead Im going to try to highlight a few key pointsFF1 puts some serious investment into its storylines While it might officially be an MMOFF1 is also probably the largest JRPG ever made Expect dozens of hours of cutscenes and story eventswith me having about 300 hours played when I finished all current story content Now I didnt spend all 300 of those hours only doing story contentbut that should give you a pretty decent idea of how large the story is If you are familiar with this franchise then you have a pretty good idea of what to expectand longtime fans will see many familiar names among this games characters and boss fights On the other hand the story is a bit mediocre early on and only really gets going in the first expansion Heavensward Technically you can skip all the cutscenes and rewatch them in an Inn or your houseand even buy a skip all the way to Shadowbringers if you really want tobut Id recommend against it considering how much of a role story and character development play in this game The story might be a bit bland and lengthy in its early stagesbut it becomes one of the better parts of this gameFF1 has a large number of different classesor jobsthat you can play as You get your typical MMO setup of tankshealersmeleeand ranged each with their own distinct play stylestrengthsand weaknesses Crafting and gathering in FF1 is much more developed than in most MMOs with each of them being different classes in their own right But unlike most MMOsFF1 allows you to play all of these different classes on a single character This is a major selling point for someone like me with major alt problems in other MMOs 12 120s in WoWfor example FF1 ensures that you are able to play all of the classes and their own storylines while at the same time not forcing you to build a new character from scratch for each different classthere are plenty of opportunities for PvE and PvP When it comes to PvPill admit that my experience is somewhat limited However from what I have seen of PvP in FF1 it is a bit clunkydoes not seem to be particularly popularand is one of the few areas where WoW clearly beats FF1 for now As for PvEFF1 is very strong indeed There are a large number of Dungeons  player runsTrials 8 player boss fightsRaids 8 playersand Alliance Raids 2 players FF1s version of LFGthe Duty Finderis simple to use and allows you to queue up for any content you have unlocked  though you may want an organized group for the high difficulty content Worth mentioning are the roulettes which let you select a category such as TrialsLevel 80 Dungeonsor Alliance Raids to queue for and obtain a daily reward based upon your class level FF1 does have level scaling that reduces your level to fit whatever PvE content you find yourself inthough it is possible to turn this off for your own private groupsFF1 has a tokenbadge system where you collect currencies from doing 50 PvE content that you can use to buy gearmaterialsand other goodies There is also nothing like the Titanforging or weekly chest RNG BS like what is in current 825 WoW Current content raids work a little differently in FF1 toowith you being limited in the amount of gear items you can get per week On the one hand this 
1,Lookyou can just see how much Ive played this game to know that I like it Its a good game with a great free trial you can play if you want to get a feel for it Youve probably heard it all before from word of mouth so Im not going to try and sell it for you here just know that its really goodand maybe the most important If you buy the game on steam you can only buy the steam version of the expansionthere are two types of subscriptions Entry and Standard subscriptions are differentstartingis 199 USD This one has 8 charcters per sever with a total of 0 overall With a standard subscription you also have the option to purchase multiple months at a time This can save you money in the long run especially if you are really into the gamefor those who are used to WoW You can play every classand every jobon one characteryou can play anything you want when you want to If a new class comes out you only have to be at the level the class requiresyou dont have to create a whole new character for it This was a big draw for me as swapping characters all the time was a real pain Yes theres still some grinding involved as youll have to level up that class as well nowbut you dont have to always start from square one If anyone who used to play wow is reading thisname changes and race changes are also way cheaper from what I remember them being in WoW A name change is 10 USD on here and a Fantasiawhich is a way to completely makeover your character changingracegenderand nearly everything else save the nameis also 10 USD but can also be bought in packs of 3 or 5 that can save you some moneyoff the top of my headthat can help people new to the game If youre reading this I hope you have fun at least trying it outRegistering your account is the hardest quest so farSo I have bought this game on 052517 and have been only playing this game till 0602017 with an accumulate of 139 hoursChocobo and Chocobo racingis that in FFXIVthere is no rush in this game You can be what you want to be and you are not forced to do anything elsethere are TrialsExtreme which increases the difficulties making it twice as hardyou are in a party of 8 of what you do is important Everyone has to work together and synchronize too be able clear this content The amount of time varies but in the most extreme hardcore raiders it can take them a 57 days to clear but for normal players it can take them 23 weeks  There is also a 8 man savage content that released in the Eureka contentthere is always a new mechanic that is very unique This type of content take up to possibly more than 60 hours Being it can take you more than 13 months just to clear 1 ultimate Though yes its hard But that is what makes this so much fun The reward is that you will get a ultimate title and a unique ultimate weapon But its worth itdungeons or crafting Every gear in this game unique There are people who actually farm gear just for glamour that just looks really cool too be being very gorgeous or just very funny Tanks3Healers7 Craftersand 3 Gathers Each job is very unique in terms of playstyle You can be good with a specific class But you will see a huge difference in terms of skill of the class you play too someone who plays the same class as you This means even though you know your class You havent mastered it being there are rotationsif you do buy the steam versionyou can purchase subscription with steam credits But this is how the game is still alive and healthyFinal Fantasy 1 feels like the MMO that filled the void of my heart from what an MMO should beI feel like I can write at least a small review with 5 thousand hours in the game so here we gothe best mmo in my opinion out there Good musicdungeonsstory and awesome community Rocky start but starts to get better after the first expansionthe base game you get is easily the longest and grueling at times Quests that make you go fetch things from A to Btalk to this person etc Howeverit still has some good pointsHealer or DPS Each training focuses on the general tasks your role does The rewards you get are gear that lasts until lvl 20 and a ring that grants you XP until lvl 25 or lvl 30the struggles of each nationhow the events prior to your arrival transpired and affected them along with some politicswith ARR donelets give a look at what is to come Spoiler free of courseHeavenswardintroduces new things to the fray like mechanicslocations and it starts the addition of flying in each zone with whatever mount you want Aside from those it features an engaging soundtrack that changes with each phase making the fights more fun and epic Worthy of the title you have been bestowed upon back in A Real Reborn What it also brings are 3 new classes Dark KnightAstrologian and Machinist All three are accessible once you start the Heavensward expansion but start at a lower level than its entry levelespecially if you enjoy multitaskingHeavensward will leave you very satisfied with how the game evolved But it does not end thereStormblood Like beforeit adds new mechanics and music along with two new areasboth having zones that you can enable flying in With it comes 2 new classes this timeboth DPSwhich some of you might laugh at because of its name Simple in gameplay but once you reach a higher level and learn its gimmicks you can see yourself dishing out large amounts of damagethe latest expansion Shadowbringerssat at the edge of their seat and with their heart clenched I shall leave the reasons to you Minor advice Buckle up Things go to another level As beforenew zones with unlockable flyingthe player having 3 sets of combos One for gathering Cartridges followed by a combo that uses a cartridge and another one that uses the 2nd combo Confused So was I but it comes around A good description would be Devil May Cry but tab target stylethe dancer swoops in with its buff by performing steps with their Dance Partnerincreasing both of their damage as the timer goes down At later levels you can buff the party members around yourselfalso increasing their damage With their Dance Partner they can buff and heal each other and those around themyes Well that is because I have been

lifeless antagonistic forces in the game into strangely sympathetic villains The themes through the story are strongand conveyed in honestly intuitive ways bThe musicb is unbelievably good One or two areas have some weaker themesbut the urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvAG5qx583Uysdungeonsurl and raids have absolutely stunning scores The area designs are lackingin my opinionbut they are easy to traverseandwellits very subjectiveorganized in no particular orderand the meta is tightwithand I know this is hard to believeevery class performing well Its very well balanced on the PvE sideand this is being generousiawfuli Its poorly balancedits map design is shoddyand its not very rewarding in terms of character progressionif at all It can be fun in short doses because it is chaoticbut playing it anymore than that is frustratingand there is a wide variety of styles to pursuealso known as the Mogstationis quite prevalent Not in the sense that you are forced to visit itor that you have to to get an advantagejust that manymany people use it Premium costumes and emotes are frequentas well as sales It doesnt bother me muchbut I mention it because it can be annoying to see someone wearing a cool setonly to discover it cost them 12slowand prone to problems The bcustomer supportb as well is slowbut I have found them to be at the very least helpful and patient AlsoI find Final Fantasy XIV a rewarding way to waste my time I often find myself just standing in placestalking with my friends andor strangers I happen to meet ingame I recommend this to anyone who wants a relaxed MMO with a flair for the dramatich1 Sum uph1even without the expansions Up to 2000 hours easilylooks appealing and raises the difficulty in later levelsbosses and raids look amazingfeaturing rich details and lots of effectsas well as other features to keep players together and make it easy to connectthough it gets much betterit becomes a trial and error experience when battling new bosses and exploring new dungeonsthat its system is easy to learn but hard to master and that it has a lot of versatility when it comes to its players It is a fluid system with a good amount of room to explore and take it easyonce they do they are able to queue up for dungeonstrialsbosses and raids which they can battle together with friends or with other players through the party finderwhich works like a charmthen at lv 30that class will become a job Job is a more specialized class Depending on the class the player choosesgameplay will vary and while it would be impossible to mention all of them in a reviewI will give some examples Classes are divided into three rolesto a more offensive approach with the scholar who has damaging spells Players can also opt to get a mix of both with astrologianwhich depends on the high skill of the player and some RGN but features the higher arrange of abilitieswhich enjoy lots of damaging spells but lack utilityto bards who can buff their whole party with beneficial effects while keeping up damage or ninjaswho mix different kinds of abilities to generate powerful ninjutsuthey always must protect their fragile party members and be the shield that guards the realm of men Like their description saysthey keep everyone out of harms way by provoking monsterrushing to deploy barriers or just being a pain for bosses to get rid of in general Tanks will redirect all the damage towards them so that the healers and dps’s can do their jobs without preoccupying about dyingand with the finderyou are always guaranteed to get a good balance of all of them Each of these roles is equally important as they are pieces of a greater whole The healers keep everyone alivethe DPS kills the enemies and the tanks keep the other two out of harms way No matter which role you chooseyou will always be important for your partythere is another type of roles I haven’t mentioned yet These are the disciples of the hand and the disciples of the hand In these fieldsplayers can find classes ranging from blacksmiths to fishermen or even culinarian These jobs tend to break the normal pace of the game and offer a more relaxing environment They might sound boring at firstbut players often find themselves lost in them for hours Once you get goingyou just want to do moreand they are beneficial to yourself and your other classesfor exampleyou can make your own food which allows you to get bonus exp modifiers If you are a blacksmith or an armoreryou can craft your own weapons and armors to use in your other classes If you are a fishermanyou can sell the fish for lots of money on the player market and wellwho doesn’t love fishing in a gameunfortunatelybut these are quite enjoyablefilled with lots of believable charactersconflictsdevelopment and moreso if you are not into spending a lot of time readingwatching cutscenesyou can always skip them and rewatch them later at an inn’s room There are also plenty of summaries only that are well written and consist of thirty to an hour reading material per expansion game2 expansions 3 hours of reading total so feel free to skip it if you do find it boring or exhausting to sit through Do however note that the story is one of the strongest points of the gamethis is not a big issue by any means Duties can be bothersome when you are at a party with friends but are overall enjoyable Probably the easiest MMO to get into has a UI that the player can adjust to fit their playstyle or needs and the game lacks any sort of pay to win or ingame advantage bought with real moneyonly shortcuts for those that simply don’t have a lot of timefluent system with that is easy to use but hard to master By sharing all classes across one characterthe player will never need to go back to the start of the game in they decide that maybe that class they pickedin the beginningwasn’t the one for themgetting devours by a Cerberus and fighting the beast from its stomach or even getting split from their bodies and have to move across a labyrinth of AOE’s in order to go back into them and continue the fight There is always something new in waiting for the player in the next encounterit is filled with great amounts of content and different ice breakers to teach new players how to play and hold their hands until they can go by themselves into the wild worlds of Eorzea There are a bunch of side activities to break the normal pace of the game and have some fun if you are ever tired from questingand each dungeon or trial keep adding new mechanicskeeping the game entertaining and making you wonder what you will encounter in your next adventure I recommend this game to those that haven’t experienced an MMOand to those that have as wellb Alexanders Club Curationsb if you like and want to see more reviews like this oneurlquoteIts important to know what this MMO is and isntgenerally speakingtheres only one right way to play a given class It bisntb some emergent life simulator where player actions directly influence some sprawlingcontinuous overworld Everything in the game is instancedarguably including the overworld which is broken up into several load zonesyoull enjoy the games great presentationmusicand writing Once you reach the endgamethe combat ifinallyi meets its potential with harder content in the form of extreme trials and savage raidsGraphicsThis game is really goodbut you dont have to take my word for itwanna play it just download the free trial from the square enix page You will need an square enix account to play it anywaysyou can play the game with little to no changes for free up to level 60 that´s like a lot of content my dudesbase game  one expansionthats easy 100 hs of content If by that time you dont like itdont buy it Risk freeno moneycredit card asked in advance and you can migrate your free trial character to your paid game in less than a five minutesIm incredibly happy to see the injection of new players after WoW shat the bed with Shadowlands and 91 I played WoW for nearly a decade of my life and through every expansion to endgameand I have to say that Blizzard doesnt hold a candle to ANYTHING Square Enix has pushed out for FFXIV Allow me to explainstarting with the cons of FFXIVthis isnt necessarily a negativebut some might think soand almost all of it is good howeversome expansions are better than others and each have their own theme and build off of each other ARR vanilla is arguably the worstbut begins to pick up about halfway throughand the rest of the expansions are excellent with Shadowbringers being one of the best narratives Ive seen in an MMORPGthen you can buy thesethe game functions just fine without themb BUY SHADOWBRINGERS BEFORE BUYING ENDWALKER IF YOU BUY ENDWALKER EXPECTING TO HAVE EVERYTHING ELSEYOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY THE CURRENTLY RELEASED CONTENT UNTIL ENDWALKER RELEASES bIve played WoW for yearsand the following game mechanics and features completely outstrip WoW in terms of functionality and enjoymentjobs and you can switch between them with literally a click of your mouse b This game respects your time immensely Tired of playing the ArcherBard No problem Switch on over to your GladiatorPaladin and nothing changes except your class Not only thatbut classes receive something called an Armory Bonus that increases experience gained up to your maximum leveled classlike basic defensives or casting modifiersmostly in the form of Beast Tribe dailies You can do 12 of these a dayand they reward you with unique currency that you can spend at the factions along with reputation It might sound like a small amount of dailiesbut the reputation gain is proportional And better yetflying isnt gated behind getting reputation with these factions thank god The reason this is a pro is due to the fact that it holds no bearing on anything else in the game and nothing is locked behind it other than factionspecific mounts and pets and whatnotand they give you veteran rewards every few months that youre subscribedbut thats not really the focus of the gear gameespecially at end game content Many duties FFXIVs equivalent to dungeons and raids will reward you with both random drops and tokens or currency to trade in for b specific b pieces of gear This means you dont have to grind the same raid or trial for the specific drop for weeksand instead just buy an equivalent piece insteadlike arbitrarily more health or damage Insteadbosses rely on complex and interesting mechanics SavageExtremeUnrealand Ultimate boss fights will also scale with health and damage and will require a certain DPS checkbut when youre doing these you know what youre in for and what is requiredand many bosses also have unique soundtracks and battle music Honestlymost of it is top tier musicall the way back to 20 ARR vanillatrialor raidand many have dyeable versions that can be crafted Im looking at youWoWwith your reskinned gear sets from every dungeon in an expansion Most harder difficulty content of the same duty rewards equipment that looks completely different from the previous difficultyor they follow a certain theme Regardlessthe equipment will look different and rarely is it recoloredor even days Almost all of them can be completed in less than an hourand if youre there for more than an hour then youre doing something very very wrongbut the game incentivizes you to use the crafting abilities to make highquality craftables In factit gives you the option to craft it quickly or take your time to really get that good good There are also a few different types of crafting activities that involve items that are classified as collectables and reward special currency for nifty mountsminions petsand cosmeticsbut go see for yourself The free trial includes ARR and the awardwinning Heavensward expansion up to level 60 with no restrictions to the amount of time played There arehoweversome restrictions regarding social functions and ingame marketboard stuffAn MMO you can play soloat your own pacewithout rat racing to level up with everyone else just to get to the good part This is a working mans MMO The kind of MMO you can play for a few hours a dayor even a few hours a weekand enjoy Story is amazingcombat starts a little slow but gets very in depth around level 15 And the best part about this game is the fact that it is an MMOso if you want to play with friends and go through instanced dungeons without the obligation of be here at this time ready to go then you can I can see why this game blew up in popularity It wasnt because of Asmongold or the Blizzard lawsuit Its because this game is for everyonethe community is amazing for the most partand there has never been a more in depth and appealing MMO for the casual crowd than this MMO Square Enix nailed it with this  one Play ityou wont regret it 75 of the game can be played freeand if you enjoy A Realm Reborn and Heavensward then you can sub and buy the other expansions I know I will beand I work 0 hours a week and have a family as well Its worth every single pennyEdit TLDRdefinitely worth checking out One characterALL content including classesjobs etc BASE GAME AND FIRST EXPANSION ARE NOW FREE TO PLAYwith some restrictionsyou can make your own food and you can play 95 of the game ALL BY YOURSELF You dont have to be in a guild or part of a clique The people who play this game are shockingly friendly and supportive on some realmslike Molborodungeons in end game can now be done with a Trust system where you run with NPCs There was also an update to squadrons that let you do up to heavensward with a handpicked NPC groupThe sub options come in 3090180 day increments and can be set up as recurring thanks Pasty858 180 days is roughly 78one that allows only one character per realm all that is really needed and one that lets you have up to 8 I think characters per realm for the altoholics The 1 character per realm Sub is less expensiveanyone who would like to share in the recruit a friend benefitsmessage meand doing everything short of Savage contentI have to say that I never thought I would play a game that would tug my heart strings so much again But this game The most recent MSQ line just keeps the punches coming It was amazinghave logged another 1000 hours and am almost endgame againI was not thrilled with Stormblood but Shadowbringers is amazing so faryou must give this one at least a one month strikeor 1daystrike trial now goes up to heavensward contentsee below trial periodthe free trial is now available all the way up through level

master all classes and jobs in single character and level them all to the max level 80 for nowit got the calmingthe excitingthe sadthe FUNNY one of the major things that got me hooked into playing and buying the game is soundtrackplease let me know if i said something wrong in the comments 3 I might edit the review later when i have 100000000 hours and give you the sad version of how MMO games ruined my life Until then stay safeFor a long timeI avoided FF1 even as word continued on that it was one of the best MMOs  currently out there This only increased with the release of the Shadowbringers Expansionwhich I heard nothing but good things about Stillthis was not enough Knowing how I operate in MMOsstarting one would be a colossal time investment for monthsand possibly years depending upon how much I enjoyed it I ended up giving FF1 a try when I saw how many of my oldest friends were either playing it or planning to They let you do a free trial up to level 35so I figured why not If I make it that far and like itthen perhaps this may be worth buyingI wasnt quite prepared for how much I was about to be consumed by this game FF1 is easily the best MMO ive played since WoWs Wrath of the Lich King expansion more than 10 years ago I found it to be more enjoyable than EVE and Guild Wars 2and far superior to WoWs current expansion Battle for Azeroth After over a year of enduring that messit was refreshing to play FF1 and find an MMO that I actually could enjoy without excessive RNG and obnoxious busyworkso reviewing an MMO in its entirety is utterly mad and id be here for hoursso instead Im going to try to highlight a few key pointsFF1 puts some serious investment into its storylines While it might officially be an MMOFF1 is also probably the largest JRPG ever made Expect dozens of hours of cutscenes and story eventswith me having about 300 hours played when I finished all current story content Now I didnt spend all 300 of those hours only doing story contentbut that should give you a pretty decent idea of how large the story is If you are familiar with this franchise then you have a pretty good idea of what to expectand longtime fans will see many familiar names among this games characters and boss fights On the other hand the story is a bit mediocre early on and only really gets going in the first expansion Heavensward Technically you can skip all the cutscenes and rewatch them in an Inn or your houseand even buy a skip all the way to Shadowbringers if you really want tobut Id recommend against it considering how much of a role story and character development play in this game The story might be a bit bland and lengthy in its early stagesbut it becomes one of the better parts of this gameFF1 has a large number of different classesor jobsthat you can play as You get your typical MMO setup of tankshealersmeleeand ranged each with their own distinct play stylestrengthsand weaknesses Crafting and gathering in FF1 is much more developed than in most MMOs with each of them being different classes in their own right But unlike most MMOsFF1 allows you to play all of these different classes on a single character This is a major selling point for someone like me with major alt problems in other MMOs 12 120s in WoWfor example FF1 ensures that you are able to play all of the classes and their own storylines while at the same time not forcing you to build a new character from scratch for each different classthere are plenty of opportunities for PvE and PvP When it comes to PvPill admit that my experience is somewhat limited However from what I have seen of PvP in FF1 it is a bit clunkydoes not seem to be particularly popularand is one of the few areas where WoW clearly beats FF1 for now As for PvEFF1 is very strong indeed There are a large number of Dungeons  player runsTrials 8 player boss fightsRaids 8 playersand Alliance Raids 2 players FF1s version of LFGthe Duty Finderis simple to use and allows you to queue up for any content you have unlocked  though you may want an organized group for the high difficulty content Worth mentioning are the roulettes which let you select a category such as TrialsLevel 80 Dungeonsor Alliance Raids to queue for and obtain a daily reward based upon your class level FF1 does have level scaling that reduces your level to fit whatever PvE content you find yourself inthough it is possible to turn this off for your own private groupsFF1 has a tokenbadge system where you collect currencies from doing 50 PvE content that you can use to buy gearmaterialsand other goodies There is also nothing like the Titanforging or weekly chest RNG BS like what is in current 825 WoW Current content raids work a little differently in FF1 toowith you being limited in the amount of gear items you can get per week On the one hand this 
1,Terraria’s final major updateJourney’s End 14is here And it’s great I’ll explain to all of you why I recommend Terraria You should get this game right now since the final update dropped I’ll try to update my Steam review some more posted May 522 edited May 222 May 2822 March 6221 and August 7221 Thanks for all the feedback Its much appreciatedI would put it like this Terraria is a game that has a whole world to explore You minebuildcraftfishand fight to progress through the game You can focus on fighting enemies and improving your gear to fight various bossesandor you can focus on building your house and buildings and making things look pretty Terraria has something for everyone The combination of survivalfightingexplorationand building aspects is satisfying and Im someone who usually plays shooter games So I believe that you can find something in Terraria for youthe building got so much more interesting and versatile There are so many different types of blocks in this game with their own unique textures and stylesand with paint there are even more possibilities Some of the creations made in this game are insanely goodTerraria on Classic formerly known as Softcore and Normal mode is not that hardbut just be aware that no matter whatyou’ll probably die a lot as a beginner If you like a challengehoweverExpert mode is the way to go plus you get extra advantagessuch as exclusive accessoriesfor having an increased difficulty Even more difficult is Master modegiving you even more loot than Expert mode And if you want the game to be especially difficultyou could choose Mediumcore drop all items on deathor Hardcore permadeath during character creation There is also Journey modewhich is an adjustable difficulty semicreative mode that requires a Journey exclusive character can’t go to NormalExpertor Master mode worlds PersonallyI think Classic and Expert mode is the most fun way to playand there are different songs for bosses and events as well I bought the official soundtrack and I love to listen to it whenever I want some background musicwhichbefore 13used to be the only way to play multiplayer at allbut now its so much easier with Steam integrationalthough I think I’ve found that the host has worse lag than the other playerswhen there is lag that isPVPand other multiplayer elements built into the game Bosses are often much easier to beat in multiplayer as wellbecause usually if one player diesthe other player can continue to fight the boss and stay alive long enough to let the first player respawnwhich is great for gamingthe game runs perfectly on max settings and has nearly instantaneous loading speeds On my HP computerwhich is not built for gamingand on my 11yearold Toshiba laptopthe game runs very nicely on low settingswith only minor loading timeshoweverare left up to the player to figure outmuch of which is just learned through time and experience I would recommend looking up tipstricksand other information onlinesuch as on the Official Terraria Wikior watch videoslike those of ChippyGaming and Edward on YouTube PersonallyI enjoy the learning curveand the struggle to learn new things is just the right amount to be enjoyable and not annoyingit does take a while There is so much content and so many bosses in just vanilla Terrariathat it can be overwhelmingand progression can sometimes feel slow You may want to rush things like bossesbut you have to prepare well for bossesor else you’ll probably die I used to ragequit when I couldn’t beat bossesand I still get frustrated if I can’t beat a boss Once you defeat bosseshoweverit feels so worth it And you don’t have to follow an exactly linear path either Alsoyou don’t have to play for 3 hours for a full playthrough just to feel accomplished From one to a million hoursthis game is fun for any length of timedue to low drop rates or pretty extreme circumstances There are manymany items with a drop chance lower than 1 Realisticallyyou won’t get every item in the gameif that’s what you’re aiming for I once wanted to get every enemy banner in the game you have to kill 5 of the same enemy to get a banner legitimatelybut I gave up on that idea because of how grindy it is to kill 5 of each enemy for the rarest ones that darn Nymph Banner To put it simplyit’s possible to get every item in the gamebut it’s just not worth it You shouldhoweverbuild farms for certain items But the point isjust get the items in the game that you really want to get legitimatelyand it’ll be worth it if you did want every single item in the gameyou can use inventory editors or go to free item serversbut it’s not fun to abuse thesesince they’re liquidproofwhich is perfect for building bridges Smart cursor is extremely useful for this as wellwhich is activated using Ctrl defaultsince the CorruptionCrimsonand the Hallow biomes spread across the worldand the CorruptionCrimson can destroy the Jungle biome over time and do other unfortunate thingsaccessoriesand other loot that enhance the game tremendously Once you find the Angler NPC in the Ocean biome at either end of the worlduse him to get quests to find a specific fishwhich you can redeem for lootsince it can occasionally reset the room status as suitable or reset your spawnpoint As of 14doors are much easier to deal with since they can auto open and closeuse an Alchemy Table from the Dungeon to have a 33 chance to not consume potion ingredientsand Ive played through so much of the games development back when there wasnt even a fraction of the number of items in the game To put it simplyTerraria is my favorite game So after over a 1 hours of playtimeI can safely say that I 1 recommend buying and playing TerrariaIve never actually taken the time to write out a real review of a gamebut this one absolutely deserves itonly to later beg my parents to buy me a computer so that I could play the 12 update After thatI spent hours grinding through the game It was shortly after my first time completing the game during 12 that I played the game again with friends Though not a memorable experience in of itselfit did pave the way for those friendships to evolve furtherI would periodically revisit the game on my own and with my friends for years Sometimes there would be modssometimes it would be the original experience Regardless of how I playedI never ever got bored with the game I may only have 16 hours across 6 yearsbut each one of those hours was spent in the game having a blast and completing my saves for each character I played onan update I have played through and throughI have finally managed to scrounge up the courage to say goodbye to this game That doesnt mean that Im going to stop playing itthat will never be a feasible option to meespecially with a game that has shaped my childhood This review serves as a ode to an amazing game that has changed my lifeas well as a way for me to cope with the game no longer receiving updatesand I look forward to future endeavorsIve sunk 45 hours into this masterpiece and have not regretted a single oneif youre looking for an awesome sandbox builder game mixed with epic bosses and worlds then this game is for you ten stars out of fiveThe only bad thing about Terraria is that it ends8 years of free updates and countingHonestlyI dont know why Terraria has so many haters This game literally has everything Fun to playtons of things to dobosses to killofc it has multiplayer so you can enjoy everything with friendsitems to farma lot of stuff and decorations to build withnot to mention that if you hit the bottom and feel like you have completed the gameyou can install some mods adding a crazy amount of new featuresitemsect   When youre ingame and I dont really know how to explain it theres just something very chilling about itmaybe its the musicmaybe its just every little detail about it Thats just how the game works Perfect for chilling when you had a bad or exhausting daybut its also the perfect entertainment for your free time 11h1 You feel an evil presence watching you h1only to one day wake up face down on your keyboard surrounded by bottles and plates wondering where the past 3 weeks went 1 hours in and Ive still not defeated the current final bosssomething thats a mixture of the games excellent difficulty curveand a melancholy realisation that once I defeat himmy time with the game will naturally come to an endTerraria is a sandbox game You appear in a new world with some basic equipment and no real instructioneventually you will build a small house to survive the monsters that surface during the nightdiscover some form of corruption eating away at the worldencounter new NPCs and face off against powerful Boss enemies Despite all thisyou are given little directionthese are merely facets of a larger game that allows players to do as they wishencountering all the world has to offer at mostly their own pace Part of the great design behind the title is in the difficulty curve I mentioned earliermeaning challenges pitted against a player start easy and steadily increase at a rate easy to handle Although traditional RPG elements are largely absenta discrete levelling system is present in the form of Bosses that have been defeatedmeaning if you dont progress through these enemies then the gameplay doesnt become more difficult In factthe first boss doesnt spawn until youre suitably equipped with armour and healthbut in my opinion the game is much more rewarding gathering some friends and working together to tackle the bossesas the feeling of reaching new goals is sharedand the ammount of grinding for materials is spread across multiple people It also helps to appreciate the brilliant soundtrackas if you voice chat with your group then spontaneous humming along loudly is to be expectedwith floating eyespossessed suits of armourgiant robotic wormsand a ninja suspended in a giant ball of slime all making appearances That being saidwhoever on the design team is responsible for hellbats has earned a special sort of hatred from myselfits tone is humourous at times whist still provoking a feeling of wonderment and mystery in its explorationand fearful excitement at its combat Its a game I will come back to time and time again looking to recapture the memories Ive madeand to forge new ones It is a rare game in that with no shred of a doubtthese hours I have spent were not wasted I heartily recommend that you purchase this gameAfter playing the game since 211 I have just realized I have never left a reviewand several times as a gift for otherswith friendswith my girlfriend and planning to introduce it to my daughters who were born since the game launchedfoughtexploredcreated wildlife reservation worlds as well as apocalyptic wastelandsits not that bad game after allSoheres a simplified list of what youll find in Terrariaarmorcosmeticsand building material Its crazythat fit the creative environments they pair with Boss fight music gets you pumpedbut once you work past it is where the game feels like it truly begins for meor find people to run through the game withdo it Its much more fun that way You can still enjoy it quite a bit single playerhowever its not the same when you cant laugh when someone gets destroyed by a boulder trapback when it was still in developmentbefore any of the expansions and cleanups its gone through I spent 1 on thisthe Dev team at least back in 214215 or so when I kept up with it would post threads about once a month at the least to let people know what was planned the progress of the game It kept getting updatedadding more content and mechanics I remember being super excited when new weapon types were addedrare mounts were added Accessories so your character can fly around the map Gimme Something I always admire too is ReLogic did not simply focus on adding more stuff end gamethey kept polishing up early game tooadding things like Ropes to make things easier until you get hookshotssimple versions of weapons you find later like Spearswooden yoyomore early game magic items It used to be a much less enjoyableslower grind to get to mid game content where the pace picks upand I was satisfied with it then Id gotten more content and enjoyment out of Terraria than most games Id bought for 3 or more Yet somehowmaybe a year after hearing nothinga new content update would surprisingly be pushed out This happened at least twicewhen I thought it would be laid to rest as isLabor of love from this developer is unrealand now here we are at The Journeys End updateHuge replay value  replayabilitybase buildingRPGor you are a creative person definitely recommend this game1 years of active development DLC microtransactionsa consistent 1 price tag with consistent 5 markdowns during any and all major steam saleslets talk about the gamegameplay varietylengthand sense of consistent progression The game has one of the best communities of any game I have ever played Not to mention modding is now supported on steam see Tmodloader and the modding community is actually CRACKEDFor everyone saying this is a 2D Minecraftyoure wrong This game has a lot of stuff to offer Different kind of bossesunique itemsan adventure u WILL NEVER forgetTerrariaIts not 2D minecrafttrust meHow have I not written a review for this amazing gamein the Christmas season of 211 Over these yearsIve logged just about 2 hours totalalong with another 1 hours played offline Enough showing off though Why in the world should you buy this gameyou get to completely customize your character and world After setting it all upyou get dropped into the center of the overworldwhere you can go off to do whatever you want For those of you who got bored with Minecraft as I diddont worryas Terraria completely fixes that problem with branching pathways in weapon classes and selfimposed challengescooperating with friends on an extremely easy tosetup multiplayer server By hosting directly through Steamyou just open up your world from the Multiplayer menuand send an invite to your friends Its that easy No need for messy portforwarding or separate third party accountsthere are tons of really great mods to check out Thorium and Calamity are 2 of the biggest ones out there Thorium blends and balances perfectly with the base games progressionwhile Calamity adds some incredibly difficult boss battles and other challenges in higher levels than the progression of the base game or so Ive heard Im still blind to most of it Separatelythose 2 add so much on their ownbut there are so many others that can change so many things about the game Possibilities are endless when it comes to modding in Terrariathe music is absolutely outstandingand along with the ambient noisesthe game has an amazing sense of atmosphere Evil places feel like theyre filled with dark energy and horrible power Underground caverns are filled with anxiety of incoming danger and hope to find loot The list goes onand soonin Master Modebut the weapons and abilities that you can obtain in Terraria simply make you feel amazingeach one having its own uses The controls are entirely customizableeven allowing for extra mouse buttons to be used if you have anyand theyre extremely tight I cant say Ive ever seen a more fun grappling hook mechanic than the one in Terraria Its like a 36 degree hookshotand the physics feel absolutely perfect on it Theres no better feeling than grappling onto a block and releasing the hook jumping early to launch yourself with some huge momentum thenif youre like medoing it again immediately in the opposite directionand repeating Mobility might be really slowand to be honesta bit boring at the start of the game in Normal Modeat leastbut it greatly improves as you make progressthe Terraria community is one of the best out there So many helpful folks are in the official Discord Serverif you ever have any questions that the Guide NPC or the thoroughly indepth wiki site cant answer There are many things I didnt cover herebut I dont have time to go into every reason why I love this gameand I doubt you have much more time to keep reading them anyways Pmy train of thought can sometimes go off the rails Thanks for your time reading this farand I hope this review was helpful Hope to see you around in the community Dand buy itMy wife left me and Im just sitting here building a houseThis is most likely the only review I will ever do for a gameand I believe that the grounds of my review are legitimate I have played this game for just under 6 hours Online and countless more offlineas well as playing it on my friends account for many more hours 6 years agoI asked my cousin if I could buy a game Little did I know what I was getting myself into It was dirt cheap1 US dollars at the timewhich is a crime considering how much love and passion has gone into this gameas well as the many sleepless nights it has provided me and many other fans Waiting for it to downloadI was ecstatic The art style was cool and retroand the gameplay trailers promised a land filled with enemies and abandoned temples that had succumbed to timeripe for the picking Many biomes to traverse and even some hidden gems scattered across the world I couldn’t wait to get my grubby little hands on it From the moment I booted up the gamethe music and visuals instantly invigorated me It felt so cool to create your own characterso many different styles and coloursso many choices and personalization’s you could do I spent around 5 minutes creating my first characterand after thatI was set out into a mysterious worldfilled with giant worms and flying spit bugs that would decapitate me at a moments notice My first night is one I will never forget Armed with shuriken’s from a nearby cave and stranded on a hillI had no choice but to fight off the hordes of undead They were coming at me from every directionand with demon eyes flying overheaddeath was inevitablemy gut instinct was to protect the guide because he had no home to hunker down in Eventuallywe held off the masses and dawn finally came I had realized that I needed a house to stay inand that’s when I had discovered one of the best aspects of not only this gamebut one of the best aspects of any games I have played the buildinghammer and axe together in intuitivecreative and interesting ways The early days were not the best for buildingas the textures were quite pixelated and low quality But the quality of the builds had gotten exponentially better The community came up with so many unique and downright amazing buildsand it only got better with each update There was sloping blockspaintdifferent wallshow each block melded togetherhow each block interacted with other blocksthe light sourcesthe different platforms that you could use All this and more meant that anything that you could think of you could build This game was one of the best imaginative and creative masterpieces that has ever graced the steam platformI set out to find more loot to plunder That’s when I realised that this games combat is executed flawlessly Normal mode was a bit too easy for meso the combat was less punishing then I’d like it to bebut the devs heard about this and introduced both expert and master mode in later updates providing a perfect balance between satisfying combat and the risk taking nature of the skirmishes that took place within the different biomes Everything about the combat is satisfyingeven hitting a slime with a simple copper short sword or an axe is satisfying And it only got better from there The progression is done immaculatelyprecariously positioning the player on a tight rope of equipment and weapons while also drunkenly swinging at the player from every which wayyou have to be on your toes at all time Just when you think you’ve become a god at the game with wearing molten lava and swinging a sword made of firethe game punches you in the gut and curb stomps you And you cannot wait to get back into itfarming and building Everything that you do in this game contributes towards progress Building houses More NPC’s to trade with Want herbs You got potions to buff you with Fishing Boomrare items that could RIP Reaver shark catapult your progress into the futureskipping entire phases of the game Speaking of phases of the gameit has some of the best and most satisfying transitions in between gameplay elements Every bit of progress that you make feels infinitely more satisfying than the lastand it keeps pushing you forwardto the point of not stopping I remember trying to farm for a rare item Turtle Shells for 14 hours straightand I only got 1 I did other stuff in betweensurebut the game keeps you hooked in between objectives and allows for some breathing room in between bosses As well as being incredibly challenging and rewardingit is peaceful at timesthe new music added a whole new layer immersion I could spend hours flying a kite on a rooftoplistening to the songs and watching my NPC’s just walk around and chat There is so much to do in this gameits not just combat oriented And all of this is just in single player The game has so much support for its communityfrom steam support and mods all the way up to the wiki and forums that the devs occasionally scour It is a fantastic gameand I could not recommend it moreand it has been a vent for my creativity and inspiration over the years My words could never do it justiceeven though I hope to describe even a fraction of what this game has been to meI have played this game for 155 hours at the time of writingthe developers release amazing and wholesome updates from time to time I really recommend this game for mainly two reasonsit has a great replay ability were you just keep making worlds and playing it over and over again The other reason is that you can do a lot of stuff with the world From making giant houses and contraptions to attempting to kill a boss multiple timesit is a fun game But it is also multiplayer which is a great addition Playing by yourself can get boring sometimes but when I play this game with my friendsI just cant stop playing I really recommend this gameit is definitely worth the 1 dollars123 hours at the time of editalthough it didnt change much in the way of overall game progressionit revamped andor added to many of the lackluster parts of the gameex bloodmoon fishingtown reworknew mushroom biomessummoning reworketc There was also variety of balancing changes that were introduced with 14which I believe were for the better Some staple items were nerfedbut still very good On the other handa lot of nichebad items were reworked or buffedmaking them on par or better compared to many other itemsdo yourself a favor and

and every upgrade is a step further to fun love the challenges and I am 71 so if I can do it anyone canEDIT PLEASE go and read the comments I still feel that my review is validbut the comments give an amazing variety of perspectives that I also feel need to be heard Thank you in advanceI just want to provide some facts that you can check out for yourself If youre still mad after thattotally finebut just hear me out2018 at the time of writing this review I have literally no idea where people are getting the notion that this was changed in accordance with Gathering Stormbut these policies have been applying to you that entire timeany 2k game say goodbye to RaptureThin Menand any incarnation of Nuclear Gandhiand the brand new title by obsidian Outer Worlds Every single one of these games is affected by that privacy policynot just Civ 6 The most helpful review states that he has played his last game of civ 6 well then I guess hes played his last game of all of these as wellif they need to ship you somethinggo and look up the producers of your favorite gamesbecause there is a very good chance that they have a similar privacy policyuntil you look closer He starts his quote right after this The types of information collected in connection with the activities listed above will vary depending on the activity What activities you might ask ANYTHINGfrom requesting tech supportto purchasing a product in the storeto subscribing to a newsletter The people review bombing this game are trying to make it seem like this policy turns the game into some sort of spywaresniffing out your personal details In factthe most helpful review PURPOSEFULLY misleads you to garner more fear He specifically states the game is collecting your address it is included in his quote that is taken out of context Howeverthis is directly contradicted by the What Gameplay Information Does the Company Collect Sectionwhere they state very plainly that they do not collect your name or address during gameplayIm not saying that you arent allowed to be mad or suspiciousbut pleasedo research and think critically before your are led into being mad for the wrong reasonsone of the top reviews mentions a web process running in the background which I can find absolutely NO evidence of Againfact check these people Its a little strange that the top three reviews spreading this misinformation all have their comments turned offthank you to everyone who voted me helpfulI love that this post is getting more comments and discussionbut that is not my intentionbut rather an industry problem That is why I said at the beginning and end that it is totally reasonable to be madbut to make sure that you understand the full scope of the situation I LOVE the debate in my commentsbecause it means that people are thinking critically about the problem rather than taking any of the reviews at face valuemany are calling my separation of EULA and privacy policy misleadingsince the former has to be adherent to the later Againthe reason I am hitting this point so hard is because I am trying to hit home the fact that this is not a civ 6 issueit is an issue that encompasses the entire companyyou avoid the problemwhich simply isnt truethat is the entire reason that it is positivebecause I like the gamebut honestly if I were in a more personal debate I can see my mind being changed That being saidthe current negative reviews do not paint an accurate picture of the situation and there is no place to correct them since their comments are turned off This post is meant to be a public discussion of the issue so that we can all share our opinionsrather than just have one person shouting without anyone being able to respondlove the discussionkeep it up guys 3my admonishment of the other reviews posted is not because they are negativeit is because they are claiming that this incident is isolated to Civ 6 when it just isnt Im not going to change my original postbecause I want peoples comments to always make sense so that newcomers can follow the conversationso its a better place to make complaints I would actually heartily agree with that sentiment if all of the reviews made it clear who is really at fault here TAKE 2 GAMES Unfortunately they do notI feel for you I hate that many here feel like they do not have a voice or a place to speak their mind This is why I was so irritated with the lack of a comment sections on the other posts I have also made an edit to the top of this review to encourage people to read the comments YOU are the ones that people need to here fromnot me Keep

about this game as it stands alonenow that the adjustment period from Civ V is out of the wayattack when it has the advantageor defend its cities effectively Youd think a fundamental goal for any game like this would be to have fronts naturally developas in a reallife war Nope Scatteredrandom skirmishes that the AI always loses You can run the map with 12 infantry or cavalry unitsplus 1 artilleryas one does in waryoure branded a warmonger Were the Allies warmongers in WWII for conquering Germany Leaders relentlessly spam you with their disapprovalconsuming ridiculous numbers of UIanimation seconds before you can esccancel with each one Despite claims that leaders approve of certain thingsit seems to be an eitherorallornothinghairtrigger mechanism A leader will love you one turn and denounce you the nextbecause they expected you to have one more military unit that turn or something There is no nuancespectrumor scoring to this systemas far as I can tellcontrary to the claim that there are several levels between friendly and denounced Its a waste of effort to try to get along with everyone while trying to win a science or cultural victory Just let them inevitably declare war and fight them offyou want to be spammed with an inconsequential 30second message for good job or I hate you several times each turn  often interrupting your next click  and wait an additional several seconds for it to respond to multiple Esc pressesand on bothit takes up to a minute to process AI turns in late game I think most hours spent playing this game are for the please wait stage Why Firaxis cannot take advantage of parallel processingor cache possible scenarios in advance while youre taking your turnI do not know There should at least be an option or default where other player moves have faster animations so that you can see whats happening without losing timewithout making all the animations bizarrely short like in quick combatI really no longer care about the details of each city there are no real mistakes to be madeand I do not want to micromanage every single tile of every single city on a standard to huge map Keeping the charge mechanic on buildersbut adding an option to automate or making it a technologylike a selfreliance civic would probably still encourage early game caretakingwhile removing late game tediumnoit didnt take 20 years for a unit to cross a civilization It takes a lot of the oomph and fun out of army mobilization when its far more practical to move single powerful units against the weak AI than to assemble melee and archer units into a tactically appropriate formation Theres simply no reason to bother with a combined arms  blitzkrieg approach in this gamebut its not flexible enough Districts should be removable at a costor at the VERY leastthere should be more information displayed in early game about the future optimal options for each tile Its really not fun to try to wing it and guess where it will be best to place an industrialcommercialor theater district in the futurebefore you can select those districts to see the adjacency bonuses Or for placing future wonderseach of which have strictarbitrary requirements At the very leastthere should be some sort of filter a lens to display all adjacency bonuses on a tileI think the air unit mechanics in this game feel awkward and unnatural Why not just emulate real life instead Carriers in real life can project power farther and to more places at once than allowed by the 2 shortrange aircraftas can air bases Jet fighters intercept attackslike in Civ V They dont sit there and take it No cruise missiles or ballistic conventional weapons in this game They do exist in real life Alsoby the time you can build aerodromes and project significant air poweryou could far more easily have created 3 times as many land units of greater power The air game seems to be rather pointlessand is placed too late in the game in terms of military advancement Air units are too weak for the time they take to acquire Minor note youd also think cheap surveillance or attack drones would be making an appearance by nowsince they really ruin whatever land youd like to conquerbut at the same timeyouve got to askof what use are they in the game The AI never has a powerful enough conventional army where youd need nukes to defend yourself Since you can conquer all other civs with 3 army unitsits foolish to nuke them first and ruin your takings Best guessif youre trying to win a science or cultural victoryyoud like to ruin everyone elses day If youre in the mood to go for one of those victoriesinitiating nuclear war doesnt really fit the billall games devolve into domination matches As soon as someone attacks you inevitableyou will have an army and be branded a warmonger for defending yourself So you might as well remove the nuisance of neighboring civs who like to attack you Nature then takes its course Maybe this is a bit realisticbut it doesnt exactly meet the 4xvaried experience Firaxis is trying to accomplishor even just to play peacekeeper Youre not notified that they are attackedand you are not given any casus belli for declaring war War of liberation after the fact also doesnt seem to become available when it should If you do liberate a cityall your units are immediately expelled from that territorybizarrely and unnaturally disrupting your advance in a way that just wouldnt happen in real life Takes the fun out of liberating that neighboring continent that had been conquered by a single civ liberating France as in WWII is literally impossiblebut it makes games far too uneven Either I hit all the boosts by the luck of the map and launch a moon landing or accidentally win a culture victory in 1700or Im tied up in a war for 00 years in which I cant go on the offensive to end it or else become a warmongermiss a lot of the boostsand discover petroleum in 1960and found that its more fun to write this review than to sit through any more hours with

exhaustionwatching a friends apartmentfell asleep on the floor for a few hoursand played againuntil he and his wife came home  He let me keep the game  After a weekI settled down to a few hours per dayback when my disabilities made employment harder to find  That gameand Civ 23and 4helped keep me goinganother friend talked me out of the kiddie pool of lower difficulty settingsand I discovered how much fun each of the 40some sides could be  The same friend gifted me Civ 6for last Christmasand I liked it so muchI gifted the 80 everyDLCasitcomesout edition to another friend  I put about 1000 hours into Civ and have already put over 4000 hours into Civ 6my main thought was channeling UPS What can brown do for you  But eventually I figured out how to assign envoys  Now I can even interpret the graphics for developed hexes in others empires sepia tonesthe map gets stuck scrollingand I have to saveexitand restart the game  But I go weeks without that happening  I havent run into any other annoying factorsIve played Pericles culturefocused GreeceRussia for a religion winChina for wonderspamming and scienceTomyris unstoppable Scythiansand my favorite so farthe peaceful Canadians  Each one has been full of unique fun  I hope you enjoy this game  There are lots of good video playthroughs on YouTube and Twitchof course  Watch before you buyand youll know what to expect  I think most people will find at least a few sides that they enjoy completelyGreat way to time travelyou can start playing on fridayand after one more turn it is suddenly sundayGlad someone caught the details on

systemand the governors and loyalty that was introduced in rise and fall getting gathering storm gets you ALL those mechanicsbut that means it costs extraPlease remove the launcher and stop harvesting my data after I have already paid youAfter putting in about 100 hours at the time of writing thisI think its safe to say I can write a somehwat informed review because I have opinions and I like to share themthats why Im no veteran Civ playerIve only played  and 6though Im aware that 3 and 4 are still good games Howevereven coming from  which had its own disappointing launch6 is a massive drop in depth and quality No matter how hard I tryI cannot lose myself in this game the way I did in  Im never on edgewondering what will happen nextbecause I know whatll happen next War War for settling wrong War for being the wrong religion War for governing wrong War for being too strong and too week at the same time War for not trading War for simply existing in a manner that doesnt quite suit somebody else What seems to be an attempt to inject some personality to diplomacy with agendasresults in predictable games where everyone hates youor everyone loves you until they dont Theres never a middle groundcertain civs simply dont play themselves as they should Hey BrazilI see youve denounced literally everyone on Earth for making more great people than you Would you like to change that Maybe build a campus or theater square No Just gonna build another encampment Thought so Nice to meet you China No I didnt realize you were the preemminent builder of wonders in the world Do you know why Its because you never built one Chinathats why AhCleopatraI see youre now chronically indecisiveas you simultaneously hate and love large militariesand simply cant make your mind up These agendas will override everything else you do withto another civ If you are friends with America and watch helpless as the Aztecs burn and pillage their way across the continentyou might be inclined to pitch in on good ol Americas behalf But more fool youbecause you seeAmerica hates people who declare war on his neighbourseven if those neighbours are currently enslaving his own people and turning his cities to ash A mans got to have a code after all Now youre a warmonger Why Good questionbut its okAlexander the Great still loves yousuch as unit scaling and modelling and such Before the game was launched there were many people who expressed concern over a mobile game aestheticjustly concerned that 2K might be trying to grant their next installment with some more mass appeal at the expense of anyone being able to take this seriously Thankfullythe gameplay hasnt been dumbed downso much as screwed up see agendas I am not terrified of this army of strangely proportioned stretch armstrong figures marching towards mebecause Im too distracted by the traderwhose cart is 2 or 3 times taller than my palace In Civ when the Mongol horde was at my bordersit stretched on and on likewella horde Now it appears to be maybe 20 horses all togethereach being roughly the size of an entire buildingand altogether looking rather silly If course theres another reason not to be intimidated by the Mongol hordeor anyone elses horde for that matter The entire combined forces of all other AI civs could be beaten back with a damp rag and a can do attitudewhich is particularly damning in a game that always ends in a war Alexander the Great of Macedon may command the most fearsome force known to manbut rest assureditll be soundly defeated by simply doing the following ranged units  garrion promotionplace in city centres and encampments Or just wait them outwhen you think the enemy has gained the advantage theyll just sit there and contemplate lifeor throw themselves away on fortified units with ranged support Its worth pointing out that at launch the AI did not even know how to use boats or planesso I wouldnt hold your breath or anyone elses for any of this to change any time soonyou can bring that into a game with your friends and make them regret basking in your presence The most fun Ive managed to have in this game has been with friendswhere the only real competition in scienceculturefaith and of coursewarare the other human players The AI might aswell be so many other city states Oh and the music While I miss wartime music listening to the cheerful Kongo theme while nuclear hellfire engulfs the planet is a bit jarring the whole idea of music evolving with eras is just fantastic Entering the industrial era to Scotland the Brave blaring in your ears while you agressively bagpipe the inferior nations of the world into submission is satisfyingto say the least But then you realize that youre building the same cities all over the mapand that the last game you tried to get into was the same as this oneand that enemy youve been contending with isnt really contending so much as falling behind because he decided to give up on winning And then everyone denounces you for being close to winning yourself And then I get tired of this and try and get Civ  to work again with a bagillion modsI always end up building the same 2 or 3 different cities with no variationI lost interest There were other mods I used that also made it funwhich are no longer usable since the summer patch I thinkit might have been the spring one I cant remember I cannot reccomend this game because it does not stand up on its own as a civ game should Time and time again the modding community has found and fixed bugs that should have been dealt with before release Maybe the next big dlc will make Civ6 a game worthy of the franchiseI dont know Until such a time I do not think anyone should buy this game That is my opinion and I am entitled to it no matter how many hours I have playedor whether or not I got my moneys worthI would not take any review seriously with few hours playedregardless of wether they reccomended it or not If my friends came with the game in a sort of package dealthen sure Id reccomend itbut I got them elsewhereand with it some more game mechanics for the AI to struggle with Theres really not much more to it than that Obvious one is climate change and disastersof which there is very little change and its not very disastrous Just keep a builder or two on stand by if youre in a disaster prone area and youll be fine Of the couple times Ive had the patience to see a game to completionnot once did the sea level risewhich leads me to believe that you have to really go out of your way to screw up the planet The main incentive for burning fossil fuels seems to be powering tier 3 buildings in certain districts Not only is this not necessaryas these buildings still provide their standard yieldbut you can just hold out for cleaner energy sources a couple more techs down the linewhich at the very least is a more nostalgic kind of stupid Fans of Civ  can look back on fond memories of the great nations of the world banding together against the true enemy of civilizationtruffles Voting yourself is pointless unless youre playing Swedenbecause the AI will mass vote to ban random things regardless of whether it hurts them or not

of a sports game and more of an actual sport In FIFA or Madden you have a pass buttonbut to make a pass in Rocket League you have to drive your car into the ball at the right speed and angle to send it over to where your teammate is going You have to create the pass yourselfand it can be anythingfrom a hard bounce off the back wall to a soft lob over the defendershootingdribblingtacklesjukestheyre all in the gamebut you  have to make them happen yourselfnot just press the right button At firstjust driving car to ball is a challengebut as your skill growsthe freedom to create any play you can imagine and execute is unlike anything youll find in a sports game Together with the mechanical skill to do what you want with the ballyoull have to develop positional awareness and learn proper rotation and game sensethat can keep challenging you as you improveand improveand improve beyond what you ever imagined youd be capable of In factthis is the ONLY one I knowBRING IT BACK TO STEAMEPICGAMES smhRocket League is a perfect game for short breaks 5 minutes of flying and exploding carsthen I can continue doing whatever I was doing before To be honestit

all moments you will see in Rocket LeagueWhen you buy this gameit will take about 2030 hours to actually start hitting balls By 0050 hoursyoull be flying around the map to score some crazy looking goals in your opinion But thenthats when the fun actually begins mastering the basic moves of the game is basically mastering  of what you can do in this game Youll end up playing more and more and moreuntil you realize youve just spent three hours in practice hitting the same shot again and again Yesthis game is higly addictive My favorite game ever without any doubtsbRocket League has one of the best progression systems Ive ever seen in a video game beforebyou would have likely looked up advanced tips for Rocket League Worst mistake of your life You now know what aerials are You think you

the golden days of gaming No bsno gimmickjust simply a good gameawesomeFirstRocket League is the most fun you can have in a game since Team Fortress 2 Its like a sport for fighter pilots I break

syndrome from it I adore this gameI want to play it forever I dont give two shits about football or carsbut Rocket League is A and then somePsyonixs capitulation to Epic Games is an extreme disappointmenteven personally heartbreaking Im from Hong Kong and spent the last year watching firsthand my city turning into a police state on the orders of the Communist Party of China Ive had tear gas in my apartmentfriends with broken bones and concussionsand rule of law no longer exists here I have PTSD from filming our now crushed prodemocracy movementand tens of thousands of young people here have it a thousand times worseeven if theyre not in jail already Half the city is in a state of shockdepression or worsehence the absurd amount of money it has to buy rather than earn its share of the market GTA5 for free must have cost billions Maybe Psyonix needed the cashand I honestly want them to survive and thrivebut it should be clear by now that any company in China of Tencents size and scope operates under the auspice of the CCP People finally know the dangers of Huaweibut Tencent is no less an arm of that statethe worlds most powerful and technologically advanced authoritarian dictatorshiptheres so much love in it that I cant not still adore it But this is a stab to the heartand frankly you guys deserve the tsunami of negative reviews youre about to receive I wish it never

credits for an uncommon item this ssand Titanium White Zomba 800 Creditsa big b RIP bor maybe to be competitive and participate to official tournaments or community tournamentsbuy this game and see atleast for  hour the experience of the gameif you dont like ityou know what to do then spoiler REFUND IT GODDAMNIT spoiler the items from blueprints you have to pay a decent amount of money to getwho wouldnt like to customize his car in his own way  Those players now are limited than before I could get Draco Wheels for example for only  Keynow they are more expensive The expensive items now are cheaper like Titanium White ZombaTitanium White Octanethey have modified the market weirdly and unbalanced In my opinionthe community have to decide the pricesnot the devs They could have atleast implemented a salvage systemsomething so you can get for those blueprints to craftto give a little bit of chance to get something  decryptors were a thingeven if you couldnt trade items from decryptorsbut with a little bit of luck you could have got something nicelike I didso why not changing decryptors with something new  like I said above about the salvage systemnot cosmeticsbut for Traders its a big RIP OFF at this moment Well see later what devs are going to doleave a thumbs up so everyone can see this  isorry if you will find someIm not an english speaker anyway  This is a great game It will take a long time before you are goodthen after you play a while after thatyoull realize you are actually stil trash This cycle repeats several timesLove the gamehate the microtransactions Blueprints are straight up idioticnice community when muted
1,A love story about 4 men and their inability to buy a drill that works properlyNever do public stealth missionJust a little disclaimer before we start Please be understanding as English is not my first language so do excuse me for any grammatical errorsthank youyou might know my cousinhe was the one who recommended this game to me Being the gamer that he ishe would constantly be leading all the heists and missions while I meekly followed behind trying to helpto breaking and entering the White House You will never be bored of this gamebut pushing yourself and your friends to the limit is possible with so many difficultiesgetting so difficult and tough to move forwardbut we persevered also because we put in so much time alreadyand always ending with a huge feeling of accomplishmentyoud know I love the customisation functionality I love the masks I love them so much그는 나에게이 게임을 추천 한 사람이다그는 끊임없이 모든 강도와 임무를 이끌 것입니다 동안 나는 온유하게 도움을 하려고 뒤에 따라각 개별 힙스트의 순수한 다양성과 창의력은 믿을 수 없습니다하지만 제한에 자신과 친구를 밀어 너무 많은 어려움과 함께 가능 하다우리는 인내심을 가지고 이미 너무 많은 시간을 할애했기 때문에 항상 엄청난 성취감으로 끝났습니다당신은 내가 사용자 정의 기능을 사랑 알고 있을 것입니다I get into a gameAs someone who has spent 4 and a half years basically living and breathing Payday 2 and getting very involved in its communityI have a very weird lovehate relationship with this game It is an extremely fast paced 4 person coop shooterand played at its lower levels of difficulty it can be very thrilling and fun After you reach a certain point howeverPD2 becomes extremely flawedtedious and irritating The game has changed so much from its launch days to the endand the story of the game is also the story of its developerOverkill Starbreeze If nothing elsePayday 2 is a bright and shining example of why buff things instead of nerfing them is extremely toxic to a games overall longevityPD2 cribs very hard from the formula set up by Valves Left 4 Dead series You and a group of 3 other friends can team up as bank robbers and pull off daring heists and do random crime related things The stakes start relatively low with knocking off corner shops and small jewelry storesand like many other things PD2 relatedeach new heist scenario had to top the previous one so by the end youre robbing the alien Illuminati and stealing nuclear warheads to sell on the Russian black marketpart RPGyour skills matter just as much as your guns Youll need to play heists to gain XP to purchase skillswhich let you do mundane things like tie down hostages faster or increase your reload speedto the fantastical such as gain up to 100 more damage the less health you haveor yell at teammates to revive them from a distance PD2 also features a rather impressive and extensive real world arsenal Many real life guns and gun attachments can be earned through RNG dropsthough the vast loot pool means earning the exact things you want is difficultand the developers were never able to balance all the guns properly so many are just nearidentical copies of each other statwisemaps had an additional preplanning phase that you choose where to place items such as extra ammo or healing kitsas well as purchase assets to make heists easierand the loud phase The stealth is very shallow in depth You are not able to interact with guards beyond killing themand you are generally not allowed to kill more than 4 before the game forces the stealth phase to end A handful of maps have distraction mechanicsbut you will mainly be navigating around and avoiding guards This can be easier said than done due to a lack of situational awareness from being a first person gamealong with latency making multiplayer stealth all but impossible even on the best of connectionslest they be overwhelmed After years of never ending cycles of buff the players  the players are now too strong  buff the enemiesthis has evolved from a slowmethodically paced cover shooter into equipping some sort of life stealfast health regeneration buildcombining it with the lowest possible armor for massive speed boosts like youre playing OG Doom with always run turned onand then bringing either an autoshotgun or LMG because they are both the highest DPS weapon types in the game and have the most ammo efficiency Its not even challenging at that point its just tedious because the lead designers idea of difficulty was having 100 hitscan enemies spawn at oncebut prospective buyers do not need to be scared off by it One thing Overkill did before imploding was implement an Ultimate Bundle option to buy everything at a significant discountthough removing the ability to purchase DLC a la carte was a bad PR move If you just buy the vanilla edition without DLCyou can still play any of the paid maps as a client you are just restricted from hosting them PD2 has microtransactionsbut they are fairly benign now and any crates you get can be freely openedPayday 3 seems less and less like a reality PD2 has a ton of bugs that were never fixedand the balance was left in dire straits At its heightit spent resources perpetually churning out DLC every month with shiny new overpowered things to keep players paying money instead of fixing bugs and keeping the game healthy You can chart the fortunes of Overkill Starbreeze by Payday content They added weirdfourth wall breaking items and content to promote their other gamesor fellow indie developersno matter how poorly it fit with the universe and aesthetic Someone somewhere is still wearing the Star VR maskmade to promote Overkill Starbreezes utter failure of a VR initiative The developers made elaborate map changes to promote their WW2 spinoffRaid WW2another game I also wrote way too many words about In the final year of content developmentbefore support officially ended and then the development house imploded shortly afterthe quality of the content dropped noticeably Map bugs that hadnt existed in years were backart and animation quality suffered immensely with a lot of copypaste implementationetcand experiencing it can be quite fun especially with a group of close friends If youre into modsthe mod scene is fairly activethough the ease of modding also makes this game a playground for hackers and some of the most popular mods might as well be hacks The difficulty curve in this game is extremely broken and what depth to PD2s meta that existed before is basically gonebut played casually this game can still be a blastI get into a gameDo you like stealing money and killing cops no goodcause this game is mostly about fixing drills and throwing bagsRobbin banks is really funand playing Payday is a great way to unwind afterwardsAn atrocious masterpieceif the cloaker doesnt kick you the host willfunny mask man steal moneyRobbing banks is really funand playing Payday is a great way to unwind afterwardsi went into a bank with a minigun with an extremly short barrel and a flamethrower while wearing a doge mask i proceeded to burn literally all the civilians and then a man crawled out of the sewers then did a front flip over a honda civic and kicked me in the jaw and commited horrible acts of police brutality DIFFICULTY  DIFFICULTY Having Put 1000 hours into this gamehaving almost every achievement and beating all heists on the highest difficulty DSODits time for me to leave a review I like this gameits incredibly fun to play with friendsbut it may not be very fun if you are a solo player I will focus this review on Gameplay Balance of this gameas I feel like it is what both makes and breaks this game for some playerseliminating most gameplay builds from being viableleaving only select few Builds as good enough performers on a regular basis Does that mean that you ABSOLUTELY can not run your favorite nonmeta deck on the higher difficulties Noyou still canbut the META builds just are less affected by the bullshit thrown by Death Sentence Whichin my opinionis not a good gameplay designor just are so bad that there is no merit to using them even on lower difficultiesand you can customize a lot of gameplay aspects of this gamefrom simple quality of life modsto straight up gameplaychanging mods that can alter the logic of the game There are also several mods that completely alter the gameplay experiencecompletely rebalancing existing gameplay elementsand introduce new elements to make the game feel freshsome are weapon packssome are heist packssome are characters This game has a lot of weaponsbut most of them have very similar statsand weapons could be broken down into key categories that suit different styles of gameplay You do not NEED these DLCs to be good at the gamebut some of the perk decksweapons mods provided by them are much better than their vanilla counterparts They tend to be cheap on saleat leastA few days ago I was driving with my girlfriend and I saw a pile of planks on the side of the road I thought to myselfId best remember the location of those planksbecause when the heist starts I may need to board up windows with them Its a testament to how addtictive this game can be I later shared the thought with my girlfriend and she called me a loserbut Ive spent 300 hours in Payday 2 and not nearly as much time in her so who cares what she thinks  starsDoing public stealth missions is probably the worst thing to doNever do public stealth missionI blew up Malaysia
1,I have been playing BF games since back in 2003when you had to go and buy them from the game shop down the town center They came on a CDDVD BF2  Special Forces were fantastic gameswas really looking forward to ituntil I played in a match with more hackers than there were normal playersand yetafter 1 monththe same hackers are STILL PLAYING the game So you go back to the forumpost about it againand EA shut down your post and mark their spam post as the solution to your posteven though they havent answered anything properly  They then tell you they do not allow posts about anticheats or cheating on teh AHQ FOrum  Really Is that because you know you are useless at stopping it EAif it wasnt for all the hackers and EAs lack of care about getting ird of them it would be a good gamePlagued by hackersalmost no oceania communitydevs dont carehackers are so well known that players recognize them by name but they still havent been banned Lazynow that Ive played a bit more Id like to revise my initial thoughts Battlefield V has the hallmarks of a good gamethe bullet ballistics are goodteam work and strategy is goodthe graphics and cool WW2 weaponry are good But all this is overarched by critical flaws that Im guessing were the result of EA deciding this game wasnt likely to be as profitable as they were expecting Customization feels lacking at best with a lot of cosmetic items being really boring or really expensive to encourage the use of in game currency Weapon customization has similar problems with only a few specializations for each weaponmostly making it magically have less recoil or reload faster among other uncreative things The most critical flaw this game suffers is the complete abandonment by the developers They obviously knew their time wouldnt make them money and decided to leave the game in a state that feels late beta at best Theres a lot of controversy in the comments about me saying the game is plagued by hackers but I stand by this statement Its been abandonedplayers dont get bannedreports dont get answered If you want to play the game despite these flaws because you like WW2 or the Battlefield seriestheres definetly fun to be had but heres a few tipsthe official servers receive seemingly 0 maintenance and manually administrated servers are massively more effective at banning hackers than the official servers EA you should be ashamedUSA and Europe are probably okay Dont count on being able to find a server if youre a night owl like meBuy it if you like getting shot through walls from across the map Hack city Spent more money on the profanity filter than the anti cheatThe game is a blast when there are no people using exploits Some days you cant play a game without changing servers multiple times to get around the people loading cheat software to aimbot you I have had several matches where a single soldier will lock down our entire team at the spawn with a head seeking MG and the developer doesnt really seem to do anything about it Not even a vote kick feature let alone the most basic of anti cheat software How hard is it to do some captures when someone has a KD of 0 to 0BF2042 makes this look goodWhen you spend more money on Censoring the game chat then the anticheatRoblox has better anticheatNever have I seen so many hackers in a multiplayer game before that go unpunished No ingame way to report them either they just tell you to spend hours and hours going to their website and sending a manual report in and doing 1000 and 1 steps to provide evidenceroblox have better anti cheatfull of hackers and takes a while to find games Ea killed this franchisedidnt know soldiers in world war 2 had aim bot and wall hack technologyIm sorry Battlefield Vyoure redeemedFix cheater problem then we can talkThis game is currently infested with hackers Im talking 90 and 0shooting you from across the map and through buildings  kind of hackers Theres about 4 of them that entire lobbies have been reporting over and over againfor over a weekyet theyre still thereruining games Theres NOTHING being done about itthat definitely shouldve been ironed out by nowunless youre just looking to play some singleplayer campaign missionsToo many cheaters in this game It seems like every 4 or  severs there is just a blatant cheater shooting people in the head from across the map It really ruins the experience and EA doesnt seems to do anything about this Save your money for the next battlefieldLove the Batlefield series  imagine EA would care to solve the cheater issues in all their online games i might actually enjoy it until then unplayable and in a pathetic stateroblox have better anti cheatId rather buy winrarPlay it for free as long as the offer goesyou against hackersToo many hackers around It is to a point clearly that the developers are not intending to do anything about it

1,A teenage developer who manages to release great updates every weeknewdetailed maps several times a year and no pay to win this is a really good game 5 hours and still enjoying myself The Gold Upgrade lets you change the colour of your skin Possibly to abuse as camouflage I see this as the only major advantage a paying player would have over a freetoplay playerto clear up Most free to play games rely on overpowered bonuses to get people to buy ingame products This game lets you camouflage better and have more storage space by switching between characters In comparison to other paytowin games this is a very small bonus Id say most people buy it to support the developer with the small bonuses as an extra incentiveyou cant expect a perfect game from a single developer Additionallyhe needs a way to incentivize people to buy the Gold Upgrade for him to make any money If it was completely uselessfewer people would buy it It really doesnt affect gameplay all that much我们需要中文My wife left meEasily one of the best free to play games on Steam This is a genre that has been overdonebut Unturned manages to be unique in its own way Kill zombiesgather resourceshunt animalscraft things and scavenge for items Thats all you dotheres the normalthe military and the Mega zombiesthe latter being quite rare and way more powerful which will make you want to run if you encounter oneespecially if youre playing on Hardbut Unturned is more about the quantity of enemies if you get swarmedyoure gonna have a bad timeyet manages to be fun and quite graphically stunning The developer team is just one single developerand hes about 17 years oldthat is something that should always be rememberedbecause not only does he update the game on a regular basis about twice a week nowhe has improved this game from an almost unplayable mess for older computers which was v2to a polished and really smooth game v3 isbut Im planning on doing itjust because I want to donate to Nelson Saxtonthis is how Free to Play should be Theres no BUY HP FOR 5the game is COMPLETELY freeand all you get from the golden upgrade is cosmetic stufflike new facial expressionsskin coloring and access to the Gold serverswhich are restricted to Premium members great for when you want to avoid F2P newbies Againthere is more content but its not shoved in your face 247and it doesnt really make you a superiormore wellequipped player for owning ithunting animals and harvesting resourcesthese skills are all very helpful to your survivaland will take their time to be fully upgraded For now theres the OffenseDefenseand Support skillsmaybe well see more in the future new items are still being added in each update Weapons go from Hockey Sticks and Golf clubsto Sniper RiflesMachine Guns and more You can find some vehicles too with a Fuel systemwhich means you cant go everywhere with your car without scavenging for fuel first Theres also tons of food aroundbut good luck on finding it in good conditionbecause Unturned also uses an item quality system You can eat a carrotbut if its moldyyour illness  percentage will increase and youll end up scavenging for pills in order to cure itwhen you had your inventory all organized and in place Unturned now has the same type of inventory in v3which is way more realistic than the inventory in v2 An item takes X number of squares depending on its size Ohand you can choose 2 of these items for quick switching with the 1 and 2 keysyoull probably put your weapontool heresince a zombie always appears out of the blueits a great game where you and your friends can spend lots of hours just creating a house and equipping itor just scavenging and exploring Prince Edward Island to find all the secrets that lies within it Unturned is a must play to anyone who has a Steam accounteven if it is for just 1 hourit will be enough to see the effort of a young developer which I undoubtedly respect Im not saying its the best game everI even admit it can be a bit boring after some time for mebut for the price of its an awesome gameand Im pretty sure Ill play it in the future to check out the updatesI do not know Its a mix of MinecraftishDayZRUST with its own unique art style It can be moddedyou can create your own maps and share themand it is stillto this dayconstantly being updateddid I mentionit was all created by a 15 year old kid in Canada who has now grown up and still works his ass off on it There is always some new feature or some bugs he is hammering out To have a passion for anything like this young man has for this game and his business is a dream Good on you and great jobBefore I played this i had no girlfriend and no will to live None of these things have changedbut the game is pretty goodBefore I played this i had a small penisno girlfriend and no will to live None of these things have changedbut the game is pretty goodThe game itself is fantastic The community on the other hand is garbage Only servers without admins are playable The admins for this game are almost universally children who are sore losers and will spawn themselves items and teleport to you if you kill them This is a DayZ style gamedying is part of it But losing everything youve spent hours getting to somebody who simply outplayed you is expected Howeveran admin should be playing the most legitimately This is simply not the case They will teleport behind you and blast you in the back of the head with a shotgun They are the most corrupt players I have encountered And I am including hackers Hackers in this game are more fun to play against than an admin Even if you follow all the rulesif the admin doesnt like you for whatever reason You are going to die Servers with admins are like having to walk on eggshells Every person you see could be an adminand god forbid you kill an admin Ten seconds later all you will hear is a Blam now youre dead Why Because people in administrative positions in this game are nothing more than squeaking children Or manchildren who cannot stand to lose And this abuse of power will usually be followed by degenerate badmouthingdont play on severs with adminsThis review only applies for Unturned 2214 Steam launch weekalso constantly putting out strawpolls to the community and listens to usexampleif you only want PVE you can select your server and if you want a PVP experience with your PVE you can select PVP enabled on your serverand yesyou can host your own servers on your computerlike a cabin campsmall townmilitary baseand many more Your main mission when you start is to grab a meleesome food with drinkand a backpack Once youve acquired these necessitiesyou may wish to find a gun if you want to PVPor you may want to collect seeds to start a farmor even start chopping down trees to make yourself a cozy place to spend the nightserver hosts can select if players can bring in loot from their server best for PVP or not be able to bring loot in Best for PVE Immersion Their is a leaning system so you can peek corners also You can also SHOOT OUT OF CARS but not from the drivers seat of course Load some of your buddies in the trunk of your truck and do a hillbilly driveby if you wishtheir are lot of CQC battles to be foughtand also small hills for snipingbut snipers can be easily flanked if you dont post up rightplenty of windowsand escape routes You must observe a players base and attack it strategicallyyou never know how many players may be in theretime to farm my crops and build my baseI recommend you do so alsoGoodSince theres hardly any actual reviews regarding this game with factual informationIve decided to write one This game is a freetoplay steam gameso obviously anyone can really play this That being saidunturned is a zombie survival game which requires you to gather weaponsfoodwaterand other resources to stay alive So far there are 3 official maps implimented into the game Its possible to download more along with other weapons and items from the community workshop You can play this game by yourselfwith friendsor just join a multiplayer server The game offers PVP and PVE game types The game offers 3 difficulty types easynormaland hard If you do play this game and decide you like ityou can always purchase the Permanent Gold Upgrade for 499 which gives you a few gold items for your character The money goes to Nelson Sextonthe creator of Unturned Anyway with that review being saidlets list the pros and consI hope it helpedSpawn somewhere DIFFICULTY Ill be honestI personally dont care about the game Its an all around solid zombie survival open world game Not too much to say about it Howeverwhat I do care about is the dev He is a fantastic example of what a dev can beand deserves all the support he can get He is a wonderful cinnamon bun that should be cherrished in this land of abandonware and liarsBest survival Ive played in a whilehuntand scavenge for items to survive With a variety of weapons and attachments at your disposalyou can hunt down animalszombiesand other playersas long as it has the slot for it BarrelTacticalSightectMakes choosing your weapon fun You have yourself an Outfield Put a SilencerBipodand a x12 Scope on it and you have an effective silenced sniper Dont have a x12 ScopeSilenceror Bipod Take 2 duct tape and craft it with binoculars Then take 2 empty cans and 2 cans of Cola and craft them with fire from a Campfire Finallyfind a Tactical Laser All these will make a Zoomomatic Scope that is better than the x6but no reticlea Muffler Silent shootingbut muzzle flash still activeand the Tactical laser acts as a reticle for the Zoomomatic Its the small things like this that I love in survival games Being able to create a makeshift sniper using little Millitary

is pretty goodRan my cousin over with a bike and killed him11This is an example of an F2P game done right You have access to EVERYTHINGexcept for extra customization for your character Andto get the extra customization Get the gold upgrade And its permanentunlike other F2P games where you have to make 5 microtransactions every month for an account Its very realisticand with great mechanics and items and realism Alsothought Id mention this game is made by a 17yearold guy Noone else One of the best games Ive played 11Sakin bir yerde oturup küflenmiş patates yiyordum birisi gelip suratıma

1,Playing this game is like committing to a long term relationshipexcept the girl hates you and beats you with a cricket batFirstMy playing hours are like x2 because I also played a lot of houres outside steamI would like to give a positive review But unfortunately I decided not to do that  And also have decided to uninstall this game At a given moment you are just done and all the trust is gonebut are often treated as Gaijins enemyso compression Which means that some vehicles dominate heavily and some do not have a chance at all when they come  against each other in a match Gaijin does not want to solve this problem because they want everyone to find a match quickly this is my biggest problem with this gameGaijin does not like criticism Post on their form that are critical and viewed by enough players just disappear Gaijin deniesfor examplethat it was possible to cheat in their game When a youtuber proved that it was possible Gaijin wanted to copyright strike against this person or put the Realistich game mode to Arcade As a kind of punishment for the player or something I have no idea why Gaijin behaved rather childishtanks shot that disappeared in the airto planes that were shot in 12 and keeps flying smoothly I have seen everything over the years Fortunatelythere are never many bugs so that is goodcompletely ignored or can no longer be found disappears It looks more like Gaijin sees you as a burden instead of helpI close it hereThis game is like an abusive girlfriendOkay listen222 hours in this game while Im writing this I get that its confusing that Im making a negative reviewbut one of the worstmost scummy products Ive ever seen One that preys on people with addictive personalities in a wide spectrum of waysand playing well gives a nice bonus Winning matches massively multiplies silver lion gains ieif you kill 1 person in a match you lose in the planes mode youll get a small amount of silver lionsbut even just one kill in a match you win is worth a fair amountand to a degree this gets better the better you play But heres the well but Silver lions are precisely designed so that when you first start playing the gameno matter what iewhether you are completely free to playjust have a premium vehicleor have premium vehicles and a premium account you will be getting enough silver lions to more than cover the silver lion costs of the vehicles you will have access too Low tier vehicles cost basically nothing to repairas do almost all premiums and premium accounts and vehicles both massively boost silver lion income while using them You might be seeing the problem alreadybut if not stick with me here As you progress through the gameif youre free to play you will at first quickly unlock cheap vehicles before reaching more expensive onesthen things will be slower and slower to unlock and more expensive To be clearall of this so far isnt a big deal The issue comes when you reach about 7 battle ratingwhich is basically just a level for matchmaking balance for ground forces or about 8 for air forcesin my experience At this point vehicles are sluggish to unlock and extremely expensive Buying themtraining a crew slot to play themand every modification all costs SLbut also repairing and rearming the aircraft after the battle At the lower tiers you might not even notice this By about 6 youll almost certainly notice this but unless you play very poorly it wont be a major issue You might have to take it easy right after buying a newly unlocked vehiclebut other than that youre fine But beyond thatcertain vehicles seemingly arbitrarilythough theres always a long winded explanation that boils down to balance cost bafflinglyridiculouslyhilariously high amounts of silver lions If you have about 23 million silver lions at lower tiersyoure golden You can lose some of it if you have some rough matchesbut youll be fine At the higher tiersyou could burn through that in a day just by being unlucky Half the time you unlock a new jet or main battle tank its so expensive you either cant buy itor can but then cant play it because if you die before getting a kill you lose massive amountsit sorta brings us to the next monetizationbut basicallyyou can buy Silver lions for real money If you run out you can pay for more Now full transparencythis isnt technically paytoplay Its more like paytoeasilyplayhightier Youre not locked out of playing the gamebut if you really want to play high tier modern stuff and dont have silver lionsyoure out of luck unless you have amazing matches Certain vehicleslike the B29Tu4 long range bomber have such a high repair costand such a low survival rate that they are essentially useless Gaijin balances almost exclusively through SL costs Its awfulnext up is Golden Eagles This is the premium currency This is nothing newevery F2P game has them pretty much Its not something I would review a game as negative for normally but Golden Eagles are a small piece of the puzzle They can be used to buy the majority of the premium vehicles in the gameas well as silver lionspremium account timedecalsdecorationsect Premium vehicles are often unbalanced on launch but get balanced overtime I dont know if this is intentional or not but after the IS6 dominated for over a year Gaijin has toned this down a lot Stillsome are better than others Theyre objectively not pay to winbut they are clearly pay to progress The biggest issue is that new players can pay about the price of a full AAA game for a hightier vehicle without learning how to use it The game is loosely designed in such a way so that as you progress you learn the skills you need to progress Its not super linear but it naturally happens fairly well But if you can just buy the highest tier stuff with no limitations then you skip the grindyesbut you also skip the learning This leads to a lot of very inexperienced players at high tierwho often teamkillramblockcapturepoint stealand otherwise ruin the game for what should be the most dedicated part of the playerbase To be clear Im not strictly against this but theres already so little incentive for teamplay in this game that new players with high tier premiums are never actually gonna put in the time to learn how to play like experienced players do Againfinebut its two clashing playstyles that shouldnt ever really meet Jets and main battle tanks shouldin theoryhave the most depth and highest skill ceiling in the game but through a mix of map designmechanics and this aforementioned premium issuethey actually have the least depth aside from the very lowest tiersand devolve into headon ramming and head on chargesnormal for F2P gamesbut on top of everything aboveand everything belowits a lot They basically make it so you get more research and silver lions You progress faster and run out of lions slower It effects other players in no waysince even if you have a premium accountunless you buy a high tier premiumby the time you get to high tier youll likely be fairly experiencedbut the game loves to tempt you with the fact its technically possible until they add the next thingand they add new vehicles every update more or less Neverever EVER use convertible research unless you have some golden eagles laying around and a bit of research you dont feel like doing Even then it makes more economic sense to just get premium vehicles or account This is a waste of money Do not use your eagles on thislike the KV22and thus go for hundreds and hundreds of dollars A lot of the cheap skins on here are great though and a portion of the money goes to the artist so its not the worst thing ever You can get some of this stuff for free easily Againthis isnt on its own that big of a dealbut keep in your mind that all of this is in one gameOverwatchSmite ectI hate War Thunderits my favorite gameDo not to sell your soul to Gaijinyou will never get it backOh how I wish i could call an arty strike on Gaijins head officeincluding the largest Youtuber Phlydaily was pushing to have parts and fire extinguishers to come for free with every vehicleinstead of making it a module to research or spend money on So if you get shot in the transmissionyup you cant move the rest of the matchor get shot in the barrel Yupyou are completely useless unless you can make it to a cap point which sometimes there is only 1 Guess what they said no and have since never acknowledged community suggestions since then due to the horrible PR fallout They balance the game based off players stats in that particular vehicle Leaving some vehicles completely broken or overpowered for months while data comes in for them to actually do something about it Easily the most frustrating of these cases was the fact that the battle rating spread is so compressed from power creep that they couldnt figure out what level to put the Maus at to make it competitive and balanced so they just removed it from the game LOL yeah they barred new players from being able to research it cause they were too lazy to fix their game They also will gladly make up stats or armor values about tanks to fit their view of what they think it should be capable ofif you dont get premium AND a high tier premium vehicle 8 for a year of premium time and 46 a piece for the vehiclessome of which are also broken  STRV 13  to name one then it will literally take you 612 months to grind out a single nation So if you are strapped on time to dedicate to gamingthen just pick a nation and stick to it or you wont see anything past tier 34 early world war 2 armored vehicles It will easily take you a year or more to grind out the top tier jetstanks of any nationwhich is all the major updates contribute to the gamethey generally make it overpowered so people will spend money on getting the op vehicles The other portion of new vehicles have some extremely frustrating brokenmissing feature that they dont address for months and in most cases years after it being well known to the communityleaving you open to being sniped sometimes from the enemy spawn 15 seconds after spawning There are countless unintended spots that completely break the map allowing you to see the entire battlefield while also being immune to fire if you have a strong turret they tried to fix this but failed Horrible design flaws continue with layouts thatin combination with game modesmake tanks designed for hull down and defensive game play completely worthless because you HAVE to push to the objective to cap and win Oh thats right there is 1 single type of game mode dominationwhere you have to push to the middle of the map and cap a pointsometimes theres 1 2 or 3 Yup thats all we get for variation in game play across all types simrealisticarcade Also since they added thermal sights and night vision devicesevery 1th game you get is a night battle Ya and it can take a week or two wo premium time to grind out the modules that allow for this Especially for night battles but also generally most people just leave the match  after 1 death This is only a problem for the higher tiers thoughmade worse by top tier premiums making for many players to not have lineups to  have a proper ability to fight and finish a match The worst offenses for Gaijins inability to make viable maps is that they give you city maps that measure 1km from your spawn to enemy spawn in modern MBTs As well as very poorly thought out maps that encourage players to go straight to the enemy spawn and spawn camp instead of trying to navigatefight in their confusing layouts that make no sense from a gameplay perspective but are accurate to a real life locationand a lot of the time immune to even direct hits from SAMs and ATGMs Even hitting the engine and causing a fire wont cause it to crash only gently begin losing altitude all the while spamming hydra rockets at youwhich autokill you if youre in a light tankantiaircraft They dont even have their own functioning game mode meaning youre forced to use them in ground battles to grind out the later helis Which bytheway require an EXTREME amount of grinding to get to the top of the lineOR as the developers likely intended just buy your way to For exampleIm grinding the German line with the BO 15 CB2 I have 5 kills and 32 battles in a PREMIUM heli with premium time and Im not even a 5th of the way through the first heli to research 4k17k RP research points and then theres 3 more after that requiring an additional 12 MILLION RP4 million silver lions when you finally get the most OPactually good heli for Germany which gets 8 fire and forget missiles that allow you to raze entire flanksteams within a minute if left unchecked Did I mention only about a third of battles in ground mode actually will net you enough spawn points to even take one out with AGMs and not just dumb fire rockets This coupled with the aforementioned horrible map designsleading to many many games being throwawaysmake it nearly impossible without spending money to achieve the top tier helisAKA they are irrelevant to winning the game except for literally 2 bombers in the whole game that can actually win the match if theyre ignored  B29 and TU4 You cant respawn either in this mode so if you spent 71 minutes climbing to altitude trying to catch a bomberonly to have them shoot you in the engine then guess what you have to fly back to your airfield and repair and if the match ends by the time you are capable again you receive nothing for your effort At which point you just spent 2 minutes waiting for a gamethen just flying around climbingrunningcursinga majority of players including myself play thisthere arent enemy markers unless they are hit with any type of munitionwhich pings a red icon on the minimap No assist to aiming and allows for sneaky plays at the cost of also being chop liver for aircraft which are constantly a headache and only require 23 kills AA is cheap to respawn in but some nations get excellent AA while others dont even have any for certain BRs battle ratings A massive problem with aircraft being so easily available is the all too common revenge bombingusually involving the enemy just flying directly into the ground on top of you dropping their bombs a second before death  usually also having enough points again to spawn into a lightmedium tank againhere is the suicide prevention hotline 82738255Can be funbut the more you play the more you get angryAllow me to preface this by saying I have been playing this game for years and have spent hundreds if not thousands of dollars on this game Whether on premium currencybuying vehicle packs from the online store or buying premium time At the time of writing this review I have 24ish days left of Premium time leftbut now 15 hours later I see the game for what Gaijin have turned it into They turned a fun gamealbeit with a heavy dose of grindinginto one of the least fun games I have played in a long timewhile not the best Ive seenis very passable for a Free to Play titlewith only minor hiccups throughout my timethey definitely exist but they did not hinder my gameplay to the point where I would complain about thembut not with both simultaneouslywhether for Silver Lions SL to purchase things youve unlockedor Research Points RP to actually unlock themis a slog It has been only getting worse as time goes by It can take ages to unlock the ability to purchase a new vehicletopping out at just shy of 4 thousand RPlet alone have the Silver to actually purchase the vehicle upwards of 2 million and then pay to put a crew in the vehicle 23 hundred thousand Keeping in mindwithout paying for premium accountyou may only get 515 RP and 12 thousand SL per matchwhich can take anywhere from 535 minutesand some of the best and most unique vehicles can only be obtained by purchasing Gaijins premium currencyGolden EaglesGE There are alternate ways to getting it besides buying itas I have heard that certain apps will allow you to accumulate GE over timebut I did not use them myself There is a secondary currency that they use called Gaijin coins that are 11 with USDwhich is used in the marketplace they createdit completely changed the way the game felt once it was introduced Its just like CSGO skinsonly its not just skins Imagine if you had to buy the AK47 in CSGO for 7 before you could use itgoing so far as planning on removing vehicles because they would be to hard to think of a way to balance them Standard MO for Gaijin is to release one or two shiny new vehicles that are overpowered for one to two out of the seven in game nationswait for everyone to spend money getting to those vehicles and then once the novelty has worn off for playersdo it again It is never a level playing field for every nation One country gets something that completely outclasses every other nationevery patch Im tired of it and its not funbut I really dont want to give it any more time Can you have fun with this game Yeahsurebut you probably used to play with dirt when you were a kid and thought it was great tooAnyone with an asterisk in front of their name is a crossplatform player playing on the Playstation 4TLDR Gaijin is greedylets talk about repair costs When your vehicle is damaged or outright destroyedyou will be charged a fee that is paid for with silver lionsthe virtual currency you use to purchase vehicles and upgrades The amount you pay will depend on a number of factors such as how upgraded your vehicle is or the type of vehicle it is itself The issue is how nonsensical these costs are and how Gaijin determine them Gaijin claims the costs are for balancingwhich is not only misleadingbut lying to the entire community  It is about profitnothing more Silver lions can be purchased with real money and the amount awarded after each match can be so littleor even negativethat players are enticed to spend money just to afford the new vehicle they spend hours grinding for Players can lose up to 5 silver lions per match if they dont perform welland that isnt always the fault of skill it is a lot of the time down to poor game design We will get to that soonbecause it is horrendous A massive percentage of players are terrified of dying and then paying excessive repair costs for that vehicle In ground battlesI recall many instances where 9 of my team would be encamped upon a hill and remain there for the entire match because they didnt want to take the risk of moving across the open field just to get destroyed without getting any score and then incurring the wrath of repair costs My playstyle can best be described as an aggressive brawlerso when I decide to push and battle over the objectiveI will be doing so with only one or two teammatessometimes none Gaijin punishes players for losing but at the same time punishes players for taking riskswhich seriously hampers gameplay Players no longer work as a teamthey only care about themselves and how many silver lions they will make in a battleagainnot wanting to risk spawning anything to avoid having to pay for the repair costs of dying five seconds in This causes a spiral effect where teams will rarely make a comebackas half of the players in said team have understandably returned to the hangar to avoid those repair costs The newest ground mapRed Deserthas made a lot of good design decisionsprimarily with a mostly symmetrical layout It still isnt perfecthowever Fortunatelyyou can ban maps from your matchmaking Youll be paying Gaijin money to do thatof courseGaijin toxic manbabies The apologists appear to be in complete denial regarding any issue that players start discussingI assume due to the amount of money they have spent on the gamewhich is an amazing case of Stockholm Syndrome On the other sideyou have the toxic manbabies who just want something to be mad about An example of this would be a recent update where Gaijin actually lowered the insane repair costs for some vehiclesbut these people reacted so negatively to seeing economic changes without knowing what actually changedthat their outrage seems to have panicked the developers into reverting those changes very quicklywhere do you think players will go Gaijin is out of touch with not only their own gamebut their community too Its an incredible game ruined by greednor do I rarely ever leave reviewsbut they really are going too farOh boyWar Thunder After playing the game a little I wish I could give it a neutral reviewbut as of the current direction the game is taking I will leave it as a negative oneso try for yourself The main issues the game has begin showing once you reach the endgame grind eg Tier V The grind has been getting worse and worseespecially without a premium account and vehicles Not only in researchbut also in purchase and running costswhich does not really change the balancebut just makes it impossible to play certain vehiclessuch as Bombersfor prolonged periods of time with any sort of profit As a 1 free playerif the unlocking of vehicles doesnt bring you to a haltthen making enough money to actually play them will do the trickWar Thunder is a fun game that has taken a turn in the wrong direction Not into a Pay 2 Winbut in a painfully slow grindfest which fails to reward players properly for their performance in matcheshas been the Gaijin market What started out as a neat little idea similiar to the Steam Marketplacethe gaijin market moved away from a community content driven storewhere players could sell their vehicle camos and profitto a more intrusive modelselling parts for construction events and trying to squeeze as much money out of it as possiblehellin my over 3 hours I spent at least 23€ on the game and without regret It is free so whoever is interested should definetly give it a go and check it outbut if you expect to play it entirely for freeyou will be in for a long grind with little rewardAs a player whos been playing since the beginning of Raining Fire released September 22 Im proud and disappointed at the same time of this gamemy dreams werent focused on the F4E or MiG21 variants I stuck to the US tech treeand the thought of just strafing ground targets in a SBD3 as you fly low to the ground was neverending fun for me I wasnt trying to go grind for top tier jetsI just wanted to have fun with what I hadandas time went onI started to change my mindset to grind for jets Thats where my problems beginbut im not happy because of the grind Youtube channels rumored a F2P player to finish a tech tree within a year  if they were luckyyou may be wondering why did he give this game a thumbs up if i was going to talk bad about it what went wronga nice community noone really complains about losing or anything or ranting about X jet from my experience the developers are working hard in the midst of the pandemicand moreheres the current problems with War Thunderbut that was extremely hard to a point where I felt the need to buy premium vehiclesbonusestimethe true reason for Gaijin to do this could be because War Thunder is a free game Because of thisthey have to make packsvehiclespremium currency a thing so that way they can maintain the servers and keep the game alive Without cashthey cant manage the servers Without serversthey cant manage the game because the servers cant be used Without managing the gameWar Thunder will slowly diecrew trainsresearch requirementsand high purchase costsyou still have to play games in order to get enough currency Silver Lions for the vehicle purchase If you have enoughyou still have to deal with a Crew Train doesnt cost as much as purchase though poor management of currency can lead you to have extremely low amounts of Silver Lionstanks and aircraft have this system called Battle Rating They are divided into said battle ratings which fit them best Currentlythe game has stopped at Battle Rating 17 for tanks and aircraft ships at 663the problems start when the developers add more modern aircraftandif they dont decompress soonplayers may have to deal with F15s if they ever get addedF16sSu25setc as a F1 who was unlucky enough to get put in a Battle Rating 17 game F1s were made in the 5salmost all of the ads shown featuring War Thunder always have a toptier tankplaneor helicopter toptier in the community means modernday vehicles or similarsaying oh what a cool M1 Abrams i cant wait to download and play with it and then downloading the game and realizing that instead of a M1 Abramsthey get a M3 Stuarta World War 2 era vehiclebut come to the realization that they will have to go through hours of strugglinggrindinggetting enough currency for the vehicleonly to finally get a M1 Abrams that they will have to use at one of the most dreaded battle ratings of the gamethat would improve the quality of their game by a lot War Thunder has the true potential of being one of the best combat games out therebut the developers dont seem to be trying to fix the current issueswhichif fixedcould have the game be a lot better and live up to its old status of being one of the best combat gamesbut only if you know what goes on withinwhere its mostly fun no grindno high repair costsetc you canand if you want to play this game for the sole purpose of having fun with early World War Two tanksplanesor shipsthis game would be great for youI have taken a look at the dev server streams and saw that they have fixed quite a few things ThusI may do a revised review of the gamethough not until the game updates to Update 27because we cant judge books by their coverLove ithate itlove it again hate it again Become obsessed with itdespise it and the player base and the Devsfall in love with it once again Thats how youll feel playing this gameprepare yourself well Easy to enjoy difficult to master There is a whole range of emotions you will experience while playing War ThunderThis game is like an abusive girlfriendextremely

vehicleaccounttalisman and carry on to become a sweatysalty war thunder redditor and go downvote this reviewI forgot about them so did gaijinI have played this game since I was first introduced to it by jingles Jan5 213 When i first started playing i was in love It was the only thing I ever did all day The thought of getting to jet drove me to play for 14 hours at a time The game was great Then the updates started to come At first it was just harder to make money and xp People hated it but I kind of liked it Then the BR system came and balance left Matchmaking had trouble getting fair matches but even that wasnt so bad Then the russian bias got real Im not one of those people that complain that I died to X russian planetank but after seeing russian tanks and planes survive things that would destroy any other tank it got annoying planes putting out firest34s bouncing tiger 2 shots in the sideext But even this wasnt what made me quit this game Its the company They are absolutly terrible Constantly censoring anyone with an opinion than dosent match theirs They threaten to ruin RB if we dont let them attack youtubers that help them by finding cheaters And even steam isnt safe They constantly have people downvote any review that is negative I can forgive russian bias I can forgive the terrible BR system I cannot forgive this company for the way they treat their community To Anton Yudintsevyou made a game that was amazing I loved it so much and always will But what you have become as a company will destroy you in the end Listen to the communitylet them help you make the game better If you do thatthis game has a chance to rise back up into greatnessiPlease read before making considerationithe mods actively check these reviews and downvote any of them that have any kind of criticism Luckily for usSteam prevents them from just deleting it like they do on their forums I believe the top review here is negativewhich is good despite my review being positive overall People need to be aware of all the faults in this gamewhich are as numerous as all the things this game does rightbut can be avoided entirely  which is what I recommend Its not worth the trouble to deal with the mods if you do or say something they deem critical in any waybut its something The tank mechanics are very poor thoughbut if you dont mind some occasional RNG wackinessthey are a fun timekillerhappy tanking and pilotinggiving it another shot Same game mostlyjust more monetizationHi Guysmy name is Drake and as of writing this review i have played Warthunder for 32699 hours i have reached the top tier in 3 countries yes after 3 hours all i have is 3 countries that is WITH premium time and vehicles speeding progression updecently well made but what truly lets Warthunder down is its developersthey do not listen to the players unless they do something so stupid that the whole playerbase revoltslike when they tried to add p2w repairs and boosts for your vehicles they removed the maus with a nonsense excuse that it was too hard to balance when really they just wanted to make it and event vehicle to make money off people that want it they seed old vehicles that you can no longer get to players in lootboxes that you buy with real money from their rip off Great Value TF2CSGO marketplace where those vehicles litterally sell for THOUSANDS of real life dollarsthere are still bugs in this game from when it launched like 8 year agothey make players write a fucking essay on the bug for them to MAYBE pay attention to it because none of them even play the gameso they would not knowever ever ever people target the spawn first because its legal with no punishment no keep out zone1 seconds of spawn protection for tanks6 dollars for a top tier premium yes they sell top tier premiums is a little much mannot to mention thaat if you want to progress in any semblance to a reasonable time you MUST HAVE Premium timeinfact you wont even get closeabout a little under 1 percent of players that start warthunder will reach those vehiclesbecause you need millions of total rp research points to get themand when you get 2 rp a game well you see where this is going
1,Greetings My grandson talked me into trying Fallout 4 Im an older player 65 who enjoys video games I am very impressed with the game overall though I do wish I didnt have the CTDs and other issues with the game But the ability to do the kind of building along with the post war setting has been a lot of fun Being able to enhance the game through the modding system is very nice as well and gives you more hours of play as you find new things to try I have spent hours buidling and actually restarted the game now 4 or 5 times trying out different things I do use quite a few mods and Im sure the contributes to the CTDs etc in the game I thing Bethsadia has done a great job presenting this game I played the original Fallout many years ago Having learned how to make videos of the gameplay and posting on youtube mostly for my grandson to see my settlements has been a nice side benefit of playing fallout I would recommend the game and using modsjust do all you can to ensure things are loaded correctlyIll keep this shorttribes and groups have a real impact and significantly affect the worldCreation Clubaka Selling modswork that was free prior to paid modsAnd which was taken down and transfered as paid mods as soon as paid mods became a thing You know what else didnt happen The mod store also wasnt infested with a bunch of useless waste of timecash grabshitty mods that some twat threw together in five minutes sarcasmIm so fed up of the games industry right now Weve got season passesremasters of games that are only a year or two olda bunch of microtransactions not included in season passesWhile being sold and released during the season pass lifewere also seeing the advent of multiple season passesnot just a single season pass per game but upward of three or more season passes for a single game being refreshed every six fucking months On top of this Weve got lootboxes Lootboxes upon lootboxes in literally every single game being released these days which ranges from shitty cosmetics which used to be free and unlockable to full on items to make your weapons betterLike the old days of P2W in F2P MMOs You know how far theyve gone now Lootboxespaid boosts and legendary unitsitems only obtainable through lootboxesin single player games Yes Single player games now have RNGBasically gambling lootbox bullshit in them that give progression boosts Fuck This Shitthe absolute worst of it is the fact that what was once free is now paidWhich seems to be a very common trend these days in the €6 Triple Ayy games industry This is content that makes Bethesdas games what they should have been on release and adds a bunch of QoL improvements that should have been in the game on release and havent actually been developed by Bethesda Bethesda make the worst inventory systems and have done for years now Its always been up to the community to fix it and make sense of the shitty organisation in inventory across all Bethesda games Nowwith paid modsyoull be expected to pay €2€5 for a simple inventory QoL fix Likewtf You cant justify this crap Lets also not forget the fact that theres no gaurentees that these mods will be supported in the future Sosay you buy a mod Your game gets updated Your mod breaks and the modder who created it doesnt update the mod Tough shit Youre SOL and just wasted your money andpossiblyyour hundreds of hours game save that relied on a mod to work Congratsyouve just paid some random asshole and Bethesda to fuck you in the ass and take away hundreds of hours of gameplay away from youbut these things wont be paid mods but they will They absolutely will Give all this shit time and before you know it your favourite inventory mod or travel mod or whatever the hell you like will shift from free to unsupported unless you pay Then weve got the precedence of what it sets for future titles where this shit is baked into the game and there will be no way to support mods outside of itas in Bethesda and other companies will lock down these games so they can not be modded without using their service I dont need to explain just how much of an impact that will have on PC gaming Just remember the amount of freedom as PC gamers we will lose when files and sections of games are locked behind some Single Player DRM which only purpose is to stop people from installing mods outside of the built in serviceweaponsboosts and whatever the hell else Now every game has a fucking season pass Now most  at least  have locked DLC or microtransactions gated on release unless you preorder or pay extra for this shit Just as it was with microtransactions and the warnings we had about that shitfest ten years ago its going to be the exact same with paid mods If this shit sailsin two to three years time were going to see DRM for modsWhich is already a thing from the Skyrim paid mods fiasco btw in every single modthe mod scene move from being as open and dynamic to allow people to create what they want and enjoy to a more business orientated system which caters to those who makebasicallyFotM content What will happen then No more breakouts like Battlegroundssurvival genresnothing because every single modder and their mother will be trying to cash in on flavour of the month bullshit content with not a single bit of original thought between themnot have others pay for itYeahIve played it for a little bitbut in short if you dont mind losing some roleplay aspects in exchange for more modern take on combat and a metric crapton of things to dothen Id recommend this game for you I think this game should be reviewed by listing the goodthe bad and the mixed things individuallyvivid and interesting game world so far The Commonwealth has a wide variety of different areas to explorefrom urban ruins and blasted forests to swamps and the horrifically irradiated Glowing Sea The game world is also nicely seamlessso there arent many loading screens outside of interiors and major settlementsyou can now throw grenades and mines without having to put down your current weaponyou can swing your gun to bash anyone that gets too closeand youre no longer forced to wait until the reload animation is finished before you can switch weapons or access your PipBoy In generalthe combat also feels much more fluent and intensebut you can also use the system to make some rather atypical ones  things like  laser autoshotgunsplasma flamers orsayan automatic longrange carbines  without breaking the game balance The settlement system can be used to build anything from a small personal safehouse to fullsized towns with its own stores and servicestheres a whole lot to do The base game has plenty of side questsand there are four possible factions you can side with  one of which allows you to spare two of the others if you so please Each faction has its own side missionssome of which can be repeated as many as times as you want in a new location You can play multiple sides pretty far into the gametooif youre undecided or want to collect several paychecks at once Theres also a new miscellaneous objectives systemwhich lets you keep track of minor tasks and clues youve come acrossand most generic locationspecific enemies have randomized equipment and loot every playthrough Just about every enemy also has different stronger variantswhich may replace regular enemies depending on the player levelbut Bethesda also redid every animation from scratch In generalalmost everything from weapon animations to character movement feels natural and smooth New Vegas had terrible voice acting for all but few charactersbut luckily that mistake was not repeated in FO4 almost every character that talks has good or great voice acting Deacon and Elder Maxson are good examples of the latterbut see the the first point of Mixed section The soundtrack deserves a special mentiontoo you can tell it has been done with loveFallout 4 is surprisingly bug free Of coursetheres still a fair amount of thembut they tend to be visualacoustic rather than crashing or gamebreaking issues I dont think Ive had more than a few major cases during my playtime that I havent caused myself with modswhich is pretty impressive considering how complex the game isbut the biggest problem is that each of them only have a brief description rather than the full linewhich sometimes may be something else than youd assume Youll very likely want to fix the latter with modsso the underlying plot particularly faction histories and motives feels rather undetailed in the end Other than thatthe lack of lore is bmostlyb fixed in form of notes and terminal entriesbut itd always be better to hear if from characters themselvesthere are only a couple of SPECIAL skill checks in the game aside from Charismaof course This feels like a huge unused potentialconsidering that in the previous games abilities like Intelligence and Perception allowed alternative approaches to many situationsbut the rest is generally in the decentenough category Many would have preferred the silent protagonistand I can see whysome bad For exampleI personally love how power armor works in this gamebut some other lore detail changes which I will not spoil seem to pointlessly contradict the previous games Luckilythe bad retconning is limited to minor details onlyIm against paid modsbut fortunately youre by no means forced to buy anything In factthey seem to give out skins and other small stuff for free every week or twoso you can still reap some of the benefits without actually having to support the business practive whatsoeverI dont think I can give this game a rating that applies to everyoneso let me put it this waythen you might be better off sticking to New Vegas and Fallout 3then youll probably find this game to be either 8 or 9 points out of 1 For whats it worthIve certainly enjoyed itPaladin Danse looked at the advert for Creation Club filling the screenpocketing the cash and ignoring the damage theyd doneFallout 4 is really good when you dont have someone in your ear telling you how bad it isI shall start by saying that if you are deciding to buy this game then dont let the negative reviews sway you In generalFallout 4 is an amazing game and can be incredibly fundaysweeks and months from your lifeAutomotron and first half of NukaWorld DLC have really good storiesquests and environmentsareas and enemies differentlyIf youre a Fallout fan because of previous stories then you might not feel fulfilled playing this gamehowever if you love character creationslore and immersive environments with untold stories then I completely recommend this game to you2 GB patch to add paid modsBethesda 215  Let modders fix the gameh1Fallout 4h1in relation to the previous gamestook one great step forward technically and mechanically  but twenty enormous leaps backwards in terms of roleplayingwritingdialogueand quests Fo4 effectually forgets everything that fans of the series loved in the originalsNew Vegasand even Bethesdas own Fallout 3 trading that out for an experience more akin to Borderlands than any other mainline Fallout release Im not outright saying that Fallout 4 is a terrible gameits far from itbut its simply not the game Fallout and RPG fans rightly expectedand then you are quickly transitioned to a married couple living in BostonMassachusetts From here you choose either the husband or the wife to play asand then customize the look of your character to your liking After a bit more expositionyou find yourself running with your spouse your infant in their armsto a vault as sirens blare that the nuclear apocalypse has finally come Due to events unspoiled in this reviewyou emerge 21 years later  the sole survivor of Vault 111  on a mission to reconnect with your missing childwho is no longer in the vault when you emergeany veteran of the Fallout series would be able to quickly identify countless problems with it Fallout has always been a franchise about creating your own character who finds their own motivations in a devastated worldwith seemingly innumerable options None of that is true in Fallout 4 howeverbecause the character you play as will always be from before the apocalypsehave had a spouse at some pointhave a childbe either a military vet the husband or a lawyer the wifeand will swear an oath at the onset of the game to find their childwhich should make all other content meaningless until you have This kills one of the most iconic aspects of the Fallout series player inarrativei freedom Its the basis for why Ive not recommended this gameas its the first domino to fall that proves Fo4 is not a iFallouti RPGwhich will be explained furtherbut the lightinggodraysmodelinganimationand artistic design of the Boston ruins are all visually stunning The game even performs markedly well for a Bethesda titleapart from some FPS drops in the downtown areas There were several bugs on releasebut most of those issues are fixed now For onceI have no major complaints about the performance of a Fallout gamewould be the irrefutably improved combat when compared to prior entries in the series The shooting is now both precise and reactiveand the AI is clever enough to have some selfpreservation instincts Most fights are undertaken while exploringand as for the explorationId say its just as good as youd expect from any Bethesda game The world is full of interesting placesand most of the best moments in the game are bred through this pairing of combat and exploration Howeverthere is one caveat to these mechanicsthe type of design Skyrim had that circled you back around to the main entrance at the end of each interior level This is an okay design choice within itselfbut considering this is Falloutwhere the places you explore are meant to be realistic settingsthe horseshoe level structure gets repetitiveand by consequenceimmersion breaking  early on in the game Otherwisethe broader world design suffers no such gameplay errors thoughis that the power armorcraftingand settlement systems are all awesome Power armor is finally given the depiction it deservesas its now less of a normal armor type and more of a vehicle that the player drives The crafting utilizes nearly every miscellaneous item from the gameallowing them to be broken down for components to modify weapons and armorand to build settlements The new settlement system is basicbut thematically makes sense in the world of Falloutas it shows people attempting to rebuild civilization and organize societies for their own wellbeing While I dont agree that gameplay gimmicks are where Fallout should target its energythese systems are well constructed and engrossingnonethelessIll very bluntly state that the player progression is atrocious The leveling system in Fo4 removed skills from its makeupand now relies solely on the SPECIAL system and perks This is a problembecause the level of diversity you can apply to your character is limited to 7 perks many of which are boring statmultiplierswhere as you used to have over a dozen skills with values of 11which made for incredible variation in player typeas well as more worthwhile perks To compound this issueFo4 almost never provides different solutions to quests and dilemmas ibasedi on the character youve built making progression pointless in roleplaying termsthe choices are too Wellthat isn’t entirely truesome quests do have a final decision you can make on how to resolve a situationbut in essence you cant choose to ibei anything but a constant questsponge This is partially due to the aforementionedrestrictive progression systembut the actions you can take are so limiting both physically and in conversationthat you cant kill people you dont like because half of all named characters are essentialand you can almost never turn down a quest in dialogue iPlayer choice at its finesti Ohand as for the damned dialogueis the dialogue The crux of this issue is the limitations the system imposes by always artificially mandating 4 response optionseven when more or less may be fitting This makes conversations feel inhumanin an uncannyvalley waywhich bleeds into both the personalities of the characters and the depth of the quests Characters other than SOME companions are never given the justice they deserve because your interactions with them are so narrowand quests default to almost always being shoot and loot affairsbecause the dialogue is not built for intensethoughtful debates Every roleplaying element has proven to be a disappointmentand I’ll expose whyEmil Pagliarulois the only person whose job description even partially included writing This illustrates why there is a lack of thought put into the roleplayingdialoguechoicesand quests as they require a consistent team of iprofessionali writers to construct and ensure each element works in harmony Thats whats at the heart of Fo4s troubles in my eyes a complete disrespect towards writing in any formwhich is what made Fallout what it is todayFallout 4 is a perfectly well designed game on the basis of being just that a game What it is decidedly not howeveris a Fallout RPGbecause to be one of those you have to actually adhere to what made previous Fallouts so great Those who have not played a Fallout game before will almost certainly enjoy Fo4but as a long standing fan of the franchiseand as someone whose favorite game series was Falloutall Fo4 gives me is heartaches by the numberAs a US Army Veteran of 2 yearsgaming is a great way to relax and enjoy some time Fallout 4along with the Mods I usehelps greatly with my PTSD and Depression If this is true for you or simply agreetell others Information will help us all to better understand and reach our goals togetherif you will Weapons selectionCompanionsStoriesand Mods all come together and offer a way to make a differenceeven it is in a virtual world The feeling that comes from reaching goalshelping virtual characters  or killing them is rewarding and helps me keep a sense of self and a way to simply be happyPeople have demonstrated consistently since Fallout 4s release how dangerous expectations can be To expect great things from the gameand to be disappointed when those expectations are not metis quite normal When judgement is rendered solely on the result of those expectationsthe fatal mistake is made It in turn leads to a propensity for jumping to conclusionsand from that point its a rapid descent into ignorancemost of the Steam reviews consisted of incoherentfurious ranting that tarnished the whole title after only a few hours worth of gameplay After being shocked by the overwhelming amount of negativityI decided to make my own and openly condemned the bad reviews for what they were baseless and devoid of perspective It was quite obvious the authors made that fatal mistakewhich is unfair to the many developers who put their soul and passion into creating the gameFallout fans will almost assuredly find disappointments with Fallout 4as did I But if the ignorance of the older reviews and reception of previous games ought to teach one thingits that those disappointments are no excuse for blind judgement or jumping to conclusions If an opinion is to be rendered of this game in the form of reviewlet it be guided by reason and supported by logic It is in the pursuit of that fairness and clarity that I chose to write this reviewit definitely has its issues Bethesda tried new things in this titlesome more ambitious than othersand not all of them were successfulwhich is further hampered by boring choices and weak voice work Character advancements have been combined into a single perkSPECIAL sheet Settlement buildingwhile certainly funis mostly aesthetic filler that has little impact on the game world Side quests far too often amount to just killing some mandatory enemiesparticularly with the Minutemen who are supposed to be the good guys of this installmentand can become repetitivewhich I found unnecessary and contrary to the philosophy of the series Unlike the previous flawsthis thoroughly irks me I realized that this ties in to the primary weakness of Fallout 4 its lack of meaningful dialogue in comparison to most Bethesda titles Far too oftenyour dialogue choices are shortshallowmeaninglessor all threea lot of which only help you get some extra caps Its not that you should be making major decisions all the time the problem is that youas a speaking characternow have a voice that carries no power What you decide to say is almost always inconsequential The dialogue system is highly reminiscent of Mass Effect except watered down the reason it doesnt work in Fallout is that the two games have totally different approaches to conversation The previous Fallout games had much better dialogue options because they meant something Sometimesyour choice of words just made someone hate youallowed you to entice or inspire othersor developed your reputation through the karma system Now that karma is goneyour choices are just that much more pointlessit was an allaround mistake and it sticks out like a sore if youre a fan of Bethesda games or RPGs in general The dialogue wheel system could have worked out just finebut Bethesda carried it out in the wrong waydespite the certain questionable and sometimes idiotic design choices Bethesda made herethis game is still extremely well done I still feel that incomparable thrill that only Fallout can bringits still an improvement over its predecessors in almost every other way imaginable The game suffers some graphical issues like muddy textures and poor lighting at timeslike any good Bethesda gamebut its still astoundingly beautiful and even breathtaking at times Movementmeleegunplayand physics are better and smoother than theyve ever beenbut its surprisingly the best one Bethesda has whipped up thus far The suburban locations are more organically dispersed and things become more compressed as you near the cities Streets are narrowbuildings are talland locations are absolutely jampacked alongside a ton of unmarked ruins and buildings you can enter There are hardly any copypasted environments and they all show great attention to detailbut it really isn’t Power armor relies on uncommon fusion cores for power and you’re not an unstoppable god while wearing the suitespecially not at higher difficulties or levels You can acquire some strong weapons like the minigun or Fatman relatively early but finding sufficient ammo is another matter entirelybut it was still a fantastic game In much the same wayFallout 4 is a simplification of the Fallout 3New Vegas formula and is still extremely good Even in light of its issuesthis game has not been a disappointment at all RPG elements can be enhanced through the wonderful modding community and will eventually make up for some of the games weaker pointsa perk of the PC version Bethesda hashoweverbeen on a recent trend of simplifying their games too much and I hope they change coursethe negative Steam reviews had me partly worried that I’d be disappointed but I chose to disregard them and arrive at my own opinion I’ve learned that nearly every point of contention was blown out of context The few issues that haven’t been redeemed in my eyes still pale in the face of the tremendous work that was done to bring this new and beautiful Fallout world to life I have no doubt that the naysayers worked up their expectations to heights beyond reasonand it’s therefore no mystery that they hit the ground so hard afterwards I chose to see Fallout 4 for what it is rather than what I expected or imagined it to be a lovingly crafted game thatdespite being marred by some of its shortcomingshas that same engaging splendor that far supercedes its flawsand you won’t be disappointedeither good or badias it was no longer needed Changed some undesirable sentencesh1How to make Fallout 4 a decent ROLEPLAYING gameh1you want to make peace with all factions sure go ahead You want to kill every factions and leaving with only you and your raider gangs to colonized the Commonwealth sure go aheadbutso neat rightFallout 3 Where’s my fatheryou can pet the dogI paid full retail for this game and all the DLCEdit  Dec 4 215  Wow this blew updidnt expect 1 ratings Thanks to everybody who rated it helpful or not and thanks to everybody for commenting Ill respond to any comments posted here or my profile I also changed my final score of the game in order to clear up some confusionnow that Ive got 1 hours exactly on this gameIm going to do an updated thoughts list This isnt a full reviewjust a list of observationsits quite colorfulgreatly improved The guns feel like they have power The explosives actually work Melee feels like Skyrimbut it had a few twists and turns I didnt see comingarmor and power armor You can also craft medicines and drugsSuper mutantsdeathclaws etcthen a piece of armor for every part of the body Howeverby about 6 hours playtime Id already had gotten the best armors and havent found an upgrade sincezooming in with a scope drops my fps as wellit does well But I think its focused to much on the FPS and not enough on the RPG Todd Howard said it was an RPG with FPS elements but to me it feels like the oppositean FPS with light RPG elementsthere were plenty of times where I could use my medicine skill to fix or kill a personuse my repair skill to fix machinery or even use my skill level to pass a speech check None of this is possible in F4and none of that depth is there The world feels much less alivethey sacrificed features of the gamemainly skills If they still had skillstheyd have had to record so much more dialogue for speech checks Voiced protagonist also limits the amount of variation the story can haveagain because that would involve more recording See where Im going with thisbut you can be an asshole along the way You will always be a heronot babysit 5 settlementsit was good being bad In 3 and NVbeing good or bad had its pros and cons With this game there is no such thing and thus a layer of depth is removed from the game The closest thing is that your companions may like or dislike certain actionsespecially if you have the loot perks from the Luck tree I had over a 1 5 sniper rounds before I ever found a 5 rifle for instance There are a few nice items in shops but they arent neededat least I already know how to work this minigame Ive always thought that Oblivion had the best lockpicking systemyou cant be totally locked outcontroller designed UI Since there are only 4 options in dialoguethis limits interactions options and removes depthyou cant lead whatever faction you sided with They justexist and call you the leader They stop advancing their goalsyou are just given repetitive settlement babysitting quests Ive stopped caringtalk to person Maybe shoot them There have been a few interesting encounters but it all feels like busywork This game is actually worse than Skyrim about this since there arent many different ways to do it because all the depth has been removedthen break Once a piece breaksyou start taking damage to that area However how it actually works is just another layer of armor If you take damagethen you just take less damagethe armor doesnt absorb it all till it runs out of hpthey took 7 of what makes a Fallout game Fallout and threw it away in favor of casualization to appeal to a bigger audience and thus increase sales and more SHOOTY ACTION As a shooterthis game is really good As a Fallout gameit falls flat on its facedecent gear and character customizationlots of exploring and collecting Settlement building Lack of depth as expected from a Fallout title is the biggest flawFallout 76 make me appreciate Fallout 4 moreI have over 5 hours in this game It is one of my favorite games of all time HoweverBethesda broke my game with their Creation Club content micro transactions that they force you to download as updates even if you do not purchase it Bethesda broke my game purely out of extreme greed to get every dirty dollar they could thru pushing micro transactions on a community that didnt want them in the first place I will NEVER buy another Bethesda game againEVER  Also it should be noted since the start of the Creation ClubBethesda has pumped out update after update to add micro transactionsbut they have not onceNOT ONCEput out an update to fix any of the existing bugs in the game that have been there since launchI got a degree in computer science by fixing this game Unfortunatebut the game itself is aight
1,I wanted to wait until I had 100 hours into this game to give it a review I wanted to have plenty of time put into it with it being an early access title Ive played mainly solomost games like this I dojust a personal preference until I have beat the game This game is an early accessthe only bug I have ran into is an item tooltip describing what the item is The game feels completed even though it is not You can’t say that for a lot of early access games now a daysyou must take it all the way down With you not being able to dig a caveyou must dig the whole area out and build in the area if you wanted to build an underground dungeon for example You unlock building items as you progress through the gameI like this aspectI suggest waiting until the final tier if you plan to build fancy While building you must add supportjust like in the real worldcool concept You must be within a certain distance of a workbenchforgeor stonecutter while building Certain building aspects require a different crafting tablefighting a deer with chains hanging off his antlers while metal music starts playing Mobs from one biome will fight others from another It seems skeletons will fight any mob even if they are from the same biome It can be a sight to roll up on some greydwarves trying to fight the skeletons It can take time to acquire the materials to craft gear sense you can’t use a teleport with ore This means you either walkor travel by boata lightning bolt dancing across the sky Shortly after being able to watch the clouds dissipatingthe stars shining with a purple hue in the sky can be mesmerizing Some people may not enjoy the graphics of the gamesay it looks too old It’s the perfect art style for this game in my opinion The physics in this game are amazing You chop a tree down and it factors in slopchopping direction and wind into its fall direction There’s rain and snow fall in the gamewhich can cause you to become “wet” and “freezing”my opinionit needs to be lowered to same levels as the other “special woods” You can plant a gardenplant treestame animals to have quick access to furs and meatcombatbuildingand exploringa game that is 1gb Yes 1gb has brought me a ton of fun Reminds me of the first times playing Minecraft or Terraria I’ve been looking for a game to bring that feeling backI highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys these style of games as I do Please if you enjoyed reading this or found it inciteful upgrade this reviewIts criminal that a team of 5 people can build such an amazing game like this and sell it for 0the waves in the oceanthe ebb and flow of the water along shorelinesthe smoke from the campfire as it fills the roomthe ease and simplicity when it comes to buildingthe way the trees fallthe music that feels seamless and relaxingand so onjust remove it and get all your materials back Ran out of food while busy building or crafting No worriesyoure not going to die from hunger Broke your axe No worriesjust repair it Troll smashed your cart full of ore No worriesjust put down a workbench and rebuild the cart and put everything back in the cartIt got a craftingboss progression similar to Terrariabut its absolutely fantasticim a 63 year old gamer  Been playing since 1977 when the Atari 600 came out with Pong as the big thing I have primarily enjoyed openworld exploration gameslike OblivionSkyrimand Fallout4which I have played many hours on   I have already done 555 hours on Valheimwhich has some the most amazingly beautifulrealisticnot to mention dangerous biomes I have ever seendespite the low detail  The different climate effects mixed with the lightling and weather are superbAnd the sound effects are so realisticespecially the lightning and thunder storms  The crafting and settlement building along with you picking where youre going to settle is so great Definitely one of the best games I have ever playedI dont know how these devs did itbut I havent felt like this playing a game in a really long time Its a true adventureHas more game playless bugsand is polished better than most AAA games while still being in early access I would pay 40 for this gamekeep up the good work devs My life is consumed by this game I dont remember the last time a game kept me up latecouldnt fall asleep because I was thinking what I would do the next dayand get all my irl s done for the day so I have plenty of time to play later on I wish I could hug you and thank you in person for giving me back my love of video gameswhich has been gone for some timeI never thought Id see the day where 6 Viking Warriorsresurrected to fight for Odins Honor would all die from a single mosquito We had to sit around the campfire and come up with a strategy for literal bugsplease dont look up guides on this game Its so much more

I dont think its perfectit does a lot of things right that other survival games dont Its surprisingly well thoughtthrough with many elaborate systems in place which make a lot of sense in the context of a survival setting Valheim is a single or online multiplayer coop survival game that combines elements from MinecraftRustsouls like games and even Elder Scrolls and adds a lot on top of itto round out everything into one game which makes it feel ‘whole’ and well designed It constantly makes you think about how you want to approach each of the game’s aspectswhether it’s buildingcombat or explorationbut long cooldown AOEBuffs Unlike many other survival gamesyoure not only progressing through your equipmentbut also directly with your characteras almost all ingame actions correspond to a skill that you can level up by simply doing it a lot You need to be careful thoughas deaths become increasingly punishingbecause they will set you back a percentage of your skill progression and drop all your items in the place you died in This skill system feels really good in my opinionbecause it offers room for everyoneranging from generalist to specialist and anything in between You might want to be the sword and shield wieldingheavy armor type of playeror you might want to be the sneaky backstabber or even the swift archer All of these playstyles workbut neither of them will be ideal for all the situations the game will throw you into Whichever you chooseso far Ive never felt like I had chosen the wrong way to playwhere progression seems completely impossible without putting more time into leveling up some other skill Furthermore you’re never required to reach a certain skill level to do a specific thingyou’re only ever getting better at doing it by leveling up your skillsyou can build nearly anything however you likeshould the grid as well as the half size options not fit your needs The game also actively rewards you for a lot of the furniture and decorations you can build by increasing the comfortlevel of your housing Basically higher comfort will give you a longer lasting buff when you rest inside As you gather more materials you will unlock more crafting recipeswhich will make sure youre never overwhelmed with too many options all at once When building a houseyoull find that youll have to keep a lot of things in mind First of all structural integrity is not a givenhover over your building pieces with your building hammer to see how stable your structure is If it goes too far into the red it will break unless you build additional pillars or walls for support Other stuff to worry about include the rain putting out your fires and the smoke of fires hurting you if you let it build up in your homeso plan your house to keep stuff like this in mind as you learn more If youre the type who would rather shape your surroundings to your likings instead of adjusting your buildings according to them the game also offers terraforming options for thatso digging a moat or raising your foundation high above everything else is an optionalthough some biomes are by design harder to survive in than othersso dont wander into new territory carelessly The game will usually intuitively let you know where you should look for progress nexteither through item naming For instance if you get a swamp keythat means you can go look for a swamp or through the tutorial birdwho always shows up when you discover something new that isnt self explanatory Be aware though that building a base in a more dangerous area than the starting one will definitely require you to defend it against foeseither through fighting or through clever base designthe combat in this game Its mostly inspired by souls like gameswith staminablocking and dodging all playing an important part What I like here is that this plays very well together with the skill system in the gameas you will find that certain types of enemies take increased damage from certain types of damage ie blunt weaponsslashing weaponspiercing weapons So leveling up your sword and spear skill could potentially help you in some areaswhile leveling up only one will result in the maximum damage from that type of weapon Some enemies will be easier to blockwhile for others youll want to dodge their attacks and some are just better dealt with at range Generally Id say the combat in the game is funalthough sometimes it gets frustrating to run out of stamina frequentlywhen I saw how well the different aspects of the game work together Craftingbuildinggatheringfightingexploringlooting They all go hand in hand with each other For instance when youre crafting your armoryoull find that you can upgrade it with additional materialbut it also requires a higher level workbenchwhich youll get if you built your home with one or more of the workbench improvements near the workbench You want to gather a lot of wood or stone You might want to make a cart to drag it behind you and carry a lot morebut first youll probably also want to have a path so that the cart doesn’t get stuck on every rock or bush Theres a river in the way Build a bridge But make sure its stable enough and while youre at itmaybe give it a roof as wellso its safe from the rain Later you might want to come back and build a better bridge from stone and make a paved road for what might now be an important travel route for you And transporting stuff will always stay relevanteven if you get better methods of transportation a little into the gameso planning for some means of moving stuff around will definitely pay offand the higher you level your skillsthe less stamina your actions will drain However there are a ton of ways the game can make you regain stamina more slowly though debuffs like cold at night or wet during the rain and sometimes it feels slow and frustrating to have very limited actions availablesimply because of circumstances that you could technically work aroundbut more often than not simply end up having to accept Also in multiplayerwhen youll want to equip like 46 people with the latest and upgraded equipment it can take a long time to acquire enough materialsespecially if youre just playing casually or if you dont plan properly Personally Ive run into some bugs that ended up costing me a fair amount of progresshowever from what I can tell that bug has been fixed since You should still expect to run into bugs every now and then and the game server can be laggy sometimes Some enemies are also hard to deal with without proper precautions and knowledgewhich I personally think is okaybut I know it will cause frustration to somedefinitely give Valheim a try If you liked Rustbut disliked how easily you can lose all your progress to PVPValheim got you covered If you feel like a mix between Minecraft and Elder Scrolls could be funthats also a strong indication youll probably like the game At about 0 bucksId say the game is definitely worth the asking priceh1 Odin wont let me go outside anymore and I have Stockholm Syndrome h1I heard about this game a decent amount of people were talking about Valheimand since I love bothI thought to myself Heylets give this a tryIm unable to tell if that grunt I just heard came from some creature in the game or my own stomach because of the pasta I ate raw in order to minimize the time spent on something else than buildingslaying monsters and gathering materialstime is irrelevant and I could swear the other day my cat attempted to speak norwegian while sporting a fake beard in order to try and get my attentioni Valheim i is still in early access This is something I genuinely have to regularly remind myself because so farit actually feels like a finished productI could count on a single hands digits the times Ive run into bugsand all of them were minor things that a simple log out log back in immediately fixedwith no consequence whatsoeverevery aspect of the game is so polished that when you take into consideration the fact that this is a work in progress made by a small team of indie developpersits enough to put some of the biggest names in the industry through such amounts of shame that theyd wish they were Activision Blizzard right nowbut what is this game about bi Valheim i is some sort of cross between Survival CraftAdventure and Sandbox set in an open worldfight monsters and eventually face bosses It is procedurally generated at world creationwhich means that no two maps will look the samethus contributing to a unique experiencewhich requires materials youll get from various sources in the world some of which youll only have access to after defeating bossesbreaking into their homes and rummaging through the crap theyve been hoarding like a real Viking should allow you to catch up on their progression without having to do the exploring and fighting yourself and possibly ruin your experience in the processas well as earning yourself the title of Lazy Bastardyou have a system of skills which are improved through pure practice For examplethe more you sprintthe higher your sprinting skill value getswhich progressively allows you to sprint longer while using less staminabut whats so special about it blike i Ark Survival Evolved i or i Conan Exiles i which are pretty damn good in their own rightyou might notice some similarities with Valheim in terms of mechanics and gameplayis either improving on or getting rid of these elements that happen to mostly cause rectal discomfort in other games from the genreonly to be on your way home and suddenly die of dehydration because more than three minutes have passed since the last time you drankdying 475 more times in the process because some local flock of seagulls have deemed you the perfect sacrifice to their dark godyou only found undisturbed dust and sand as even the scorching sun seemed to laugh at your absolute despairthe game is designed in such a way that most of the frustration youll experience could only be blamed on your own lack of foresightalthough eating is necessary to increase your health and stamina in order to survive encounters with monsters or sudden falls from steep cliffs ubut Im no one to judgeweve all tried this IRL at least once ueven after a server restart ubeds can be placed anywhere and the last one you interacted with will act as your next respawn location until you manually disable it uand at times you may potentially suffer flashbacks from that time you tried i Dark Souls i while drunk with your neighbors newborn baby howling like a tasmanyan devil in the backgroundthere must be at least some downsides bbut as surprising or doubtful as it may seemthere arent many in my humble opinioneven on decent computers This can go to the point of unplayable on lowerend computersas it happened to one of my chums who eventually stopped playing for now because of itturns out Im just blind strikehoweverthat the game is still in early access at the time Im posting this reviewi Valheim i is a very wellbalanced game made with love and passionand it really showsthis game is u gorgeous u Youll know what I meanto when I took a sip of mead as I watched the horizon from the top of my fortress decorated with the heads of their brethrenI enjoyed every second of this journey Im still far from being done withjust buy the game I promise you wont regret itf♥♥♥ GreydwarvesIt feels like playing Minecraft again for the first timeImagine if Rust and Runescape had a baby without the PVPwe had ZERO bugsthere was about 6 of usand we havent had this much fun in a game together in YEARSthe depth of the craftingbuilding and the world itself is unrealbut this game is outstanding  truly worth your moneythanks for all your kind words and awardsthis is the first time anything like this has happenedsorry I havent reviewed every product on my account  I took the time to review this because I genuinely had so much fun and it filled a gaming need Ive had for the LONGEST timesense of progression of RustI want the developers and community to know that personally enjoyed it and show a token of supportCant quite put my finger on why this game is so captivating It has the mesmerising  graphics of Among Treesa brilliant soundtrack you dont get bored with and a nice easy progression to some really brutal combatthey just seem to have found that magic combination Sure it is a little clunky in places but its really early access and Im sure in time the devs will sort everthing out and we will have a new Half Life on our hands I love the building and craftingthe devs have really got this bit nailed By the wayIm 6 and my Wife is 67 and we are both hooked my battle maiden has her own copy Well done Iron Gatekeep the quality comingFor us 50 year olds who are just learning to game on a computerthis is a great game My sister and I have played some farming type games on a Switchbut were ready for a bit more We are having fun with this oneh1Valheimh1you must survive by gathering resourcesbuilding a sheltertraining your skills and crafting equipment to fight the forsakeneverything you eatwear or build is made of various materials and using various tools made from those materials You start by gathering branches and rocks from the groundcrafting your first axehammer and weaponwhich in turn will allow you to gather betterstronger and more varied materialfound in areas of increasing difficulty With each material you find for the first timenew recipes are revealed from your character remembering their mortal lifewhich in turns will allow you to start gathering your first metal orespoiler The game is also separated in areas known as biomesand it is implied that you avoid biomes beyond your level You start in Meadows where you will find the first bossafter which you can go in Black Forests where you will find the second bossand so forth There is no physical barrier to those biomes beyond the difficulty of the creatures found withinand you should have maxed out your equipment made from material available in your current biome before exploring the nextmore difficult biomeswhich have no permanent increase The food you eat will increase those base stats temporarilyincrease which will steadily decline over time You are limited to eating three things at any given timewhich must be different You may eat raspberriesmushrooms and cooked meatbut not three cooked meats You will eventually unlock potion crafting made from fermented meadgiving buffs to poison or cold resistanceor filling your health or staminabut none of the weaknessesand it is pretty much the case If you dont eatyour health and stamina will be pretty lowyou wont regenerate your health and will only slowly regain staminabut you wont die of hunger If you want to spend days gathering wood and rocks and building your dream longhousethen you may ignore eating completely The same applies to sleepingbeing dry or staying warm except for the freezing temperature of Mountain biomesthat is your stamina wont regenerate as fastbut you can otherwise ignore it if youre not heading into dangeryoull die If youre climbing on very high rooftops to finish your chimney and fallyoull die If you explore Swamps without poisonresistance potionsor Mountains without coldresistance potionsyoull dieand have no one but yourself to blame And when you do dieyour skills are decreased by 5and you lose all your inventory and equipment until you can go back to that location to recover itfog and weather effects in a superb manner One morningyoull be welcomed to a gorgeous sunrisethe next will surround the area in a fog so thick you can barely see an arms length in front of youand the next will have windy showers and thunderstorms It is quite effective at setting the moodbut it will also affect your playthrough When it rainsyoure wetyou dont recover stamina as fast When its windyyour boat will get damaged from crashing into high wavesthe implications regarding difficulty goes beyond that There are events of increasing frequency where your location or base gets attackedand the difficulty of those events is determined by which boss youve defeatedregardless of how safe is the biome youve settled in Having boars and necks attack your wooden walls is barely a bother at firstbut when multiple trolls are smashing through your stone walls while you just wanted peace and quiet to create a new architectural monumentit gets annoyingbut polygons and resolutions are oldgen lookingreminiscent of late PS1early PS graphics if console gamers want something to compare Of coursethis is an Early Access titleso a stable game with solid and fun gameplay is more important at this stagebut I sure hope this gets taken into consideration further down the development lineso constructing a believable mead hall or village is difficult within the confines of the available pieces The Hearth and Home updaterecently delayed further to later this

1,I have 3K hours in this game and stil have no idea how the navy works12 hours and still dont know how navy worksStart HOI 4an airfielda claim on a neighbor and a dreamyou winits called the Hispanic Nationalist Fronthas seen many deathsthinks many men will diebut you eventualy push him to his capitalThe mountaineerThe Hill FighterThe RangerThe EngineerThe legend2 hours and i still dont understand how the navy worksI have acquired enough WW2 trivia knowledge to both impress and worry people at social gatheringsEdit I first wrote this review several years ago and its continued to receive likes and awards but was no longer relevant to the current state of the gameso Ive decided to update it to reflect how I feel about the game now Autumn 221so it no longer makes sense to just have one doomfleetand fuel is now a very real pressure for Germany and Japan as it was historicallythere are now some new and slightly annoying balancing tweaks which Id like to see addressedtheyve added so many things to researchmany of them very coolbut theres no way to research them without totally hobbling yourself For examplehistorically the UK managed to keep on top of basically all sorts of aircraft designsship designsmediumlight and heavy tank designs plus associated TDsinfantry equipment designsand various secret projects like RADAR and nuclear weapons In game there just isnt the capacity to do this Youre likely going  to likely only research one type of tank light then mediumone type of bomber probably CAS or TACand probably fall behind on capital shipsdue to the lack of research capacity I have so far never bothered to even research scout planes because it feels like the research slot is always better deployed on something anything else I think there should be some more ways to specialise national research In HOI 3 this was through the research organisations giving particular bonuses I think this should make a comeback via the concerns in the politics menu  these already offer some bonuses in some cases but I think this should be extended greatly I also think they should be easier to appoint earlier so that you can specialise earlier Perhaps appointing your first concern for an area should be cheaperbut changing later more expensiveproduction even for very industrial nations like Germany doesnt feel strong enough to keep up with all the options This obviously needs to be a limiting factor as it was historically but usually it just doesnt make sense to build any of the more esoteric unitseg swimming tanksor selfpropelled rocket artillerybecause throwing factories at infantry equipment is so much more important This leads to most nations playing the same  build infantry equipmentsupport equipmenttrucksartilleryfightersCASmedium tanks Deviation is a great way to run out of equipment and lose the war Obviously these pressures are key to how the game worksbut it feels like there needs to be some sort of system to encourage diversification Perhaps for examplefactories could be more nuanced than military or civilian  a light arms factory is very different from a car factory Perhaps a car factory could be repurposed to produce vehicles but not gunsand managing your forces is so much easier No more screwing around with endless levels of military hierarchy and hundreds and hundreds of generals who all become interchangeable anyway Here there are only four levels  divisionarmygroup and theatre  and you assign generals to armies and Field Marshalls to Groups Similarlywhile in HOI3 manageing your airforce was such an enormous painand the effects of air superiority so minor that it basically was not worth ithere air power is much much easier to control and project and will be central to your overall strategy Navies have also had a makeover although I havent yet played any major sea power so wont comment on their effectivenesshere each division requires particular equipment dictated by its design as well as time to train In terms of equipment they need gunssuppliesartilleryantitank gunsand particular vehiclesall of which need to be produced by your production lines which you set up and control The way that this equipment is then handled means that upgrades are simulated much more realistically In HOI3 a brigade used the previous technology until 1 upgradedand this made no sense your Panzer 3s had little percentage meters which when filled magiced them into Panzer 4syour infantry used 1936 weapons until every single 1938 weapon they needed arrived then switched Here divisions use whatever they can get from the stockpilemeaning that your divisions take delivery of new equipment as it arrives and replace losses with whatever you have available So for example if your tank production doesnt keep upyour panzer divisions will fill the missing slots with whatever old crap was sitting in the depot Oh and about that time to train  if the Motherland needs divisions comradeyou can simply hand them a rifle from the pile and point them at the Germansits a bit too keen on them so Britain doesnt sit around uselessly unless player controlled Its also much better at manageing forces and maintaining a front line so its not so prone to huge encirclements It seems to handle terrain better tooand pick good places to push and excellent defensive positions which can grind things to a halt It also seems to be a lot less predictable and capable of pulling off some rather complicated plans  I sawfor exampleJapan launch an enormous pincer maneuvre on Chinainvading from both the North and South and cutting the country in halftrapping most of the Chinese forces out of supply Its had some problems in the past with overcommitting on low priority fronts but it seems to have improved in this regard in recent patchesin my opinionthe WW2 grand strategy game I keep coming back to it and lose hours every time I doSoI decided to go with Luxembourgsince heymight as well try something hard rightthinking Im too weak and pathetic Then it all began I swore vengeance on those damn imperialist I began to plot my revenge I hired a fascist demagogue to change my ideology while rushing nuclear research despite the massive penalties After a succesful coupor as it will be known in Luxembourgian history  unification of my people under one banner I joined the Axis since both Germany and me had mutual enemies With their help I was able to unite the Benelux region under my rulegaining more precious factories and people to force into my legions I helped the mighty Reich in conquest of Francebeing rewarded with another small chunk of land Everything was going according to my plan But then a certain Austrian thought itd be smart to attack the USSR At first everything was finebut thenoh god Then the blasted British landed troops in France So here I was facing the hordes of imperialist pigs while my best pal was off in Russia causing havoc But I knew what I had to do I had to stall them as long as  possibleand that I did Eventually Italaians and few Germans came to help and the British advance was slowed down or even halted at times Goodgoodjust a bit more time Ill show those islanders how weak and pathetic I am Ill show them In late 1944 the first nuclear bomb was produced But I couldnt drop it without air superiorityso I waited and built up more airforce to help the Germans win the air war in the regions And the help I provided proved very significantthe might Luxembourgian air force dominated the skies and allowed me to drop my revenge Oh what a wonderful sight it was to see London in ruins Does this seem weak or pathetic to you Does it Thought so Souldve accepted my into yourfaction you wankersplayed a bitits decent might cause a drop in social skillsI have no idea what i am doing but I nuked greeceThis game vs HOI3and far more balanced than the old IC system of HOI3featuring many different brigade types and support companiesallowing you to change your divisions however you would likewith content being added free along with every DLCMillenium DawnRed Worldand Endseigbeing released eventuallytmmaking continents like South America completely useless due to the fact that none of the countries there ever do anything but still build up their militarycontributing lagit can only use a single one of your processing coresmeaning regardless of your computer quality the game will run kinda slowlythe game is poorly optimized and frame loss is extremely commonespecially 1942 onwardswhen majors can have upwards of 3 divisionsdoing hilariously incompetent things such as charging endlessly into your linesremoving all its troops from your frontleaving major areas completely undefendedand completely ignoring the aerial aspect of the warspecifically island nationsor nations that otherwise need to use navies and airforces more Yesthe JapaneseAmericanand British AI are some of the worst in the game In a WW2 gameor even being hindered by your own allies Playing as Germany the Italians likely wont place a single division in North Africa In DDayyou will either be the only one contributing anything or your allies will contribute so much that the supply is ruined and your troops all die of attrition As the USSR you will recieve  lend leaseand as China you will get absolutely no support from the westwhich while not for everyoneare fun to try outwhich while to some people is nice because theyre bad with OOBothers dislike Specifically this game lacks corpswhile easier to use than the one in HOI3is still flawwed In HOI3 it did absolutely nothingbut in this game it is a core part of playing Unless you want to mircomanage every single divisionlike you did in HOI3you will use this systemthe game still possesses a learning curvehistorical experienceand HOI4 if you want to just sit back and relax for a couple hours murdering millions of peoplebut thats just meThis is my first review i have ever done and i felt like doing it because this game gave me something extraordinarylike strategy games both of us and have played alot of civilization together back in the timesfor good old times sake Little did i know

discussions of strategiesvictories and defeats Hellwe have even been sitting at the dinner table talking about in what ways we could bring down the russian bearEvery nationalist is haunted by the belief that the past can be altered He spends part of his time in a fantasy world in which things happen as they should – in whichfor examplethe Spanish Armada was a success or the Russian Revolution

1,Im 64 this is my first RPG Its great Certainly not intuitive for a guy thats never played anything like thisbut I relished the challenge I had no idea what I was doing at first I died many timesand progressed slowly Used Google for UESP for game infoand that helped tremendously I made it to Level 8sort of ran out of things to doso created a new characterand am playing it differently Im a Stormcloak this time around Enjoying my second go round immenselyOriginal versions here if you want to get it due to it being hidden on the steam storeIf you want the original Skyrim game  DLCsi

excellent modsespecially if you are looking for a nice immersion and realisma couple of things that you couldnt find at the original skyrim This mixed with the new graphics from the special edition makes it SO enjoyableeven when you roleplay warming up for 5 minutes next to a fire pitshadowsetcyou can even freeze to death and rain makes you be wet and get colder fasterthis is why i got this modwhich shows me the way to every city at every crossroadbut just what is necessarynot plenty of themsomething that makes kind of senseto drink and to Sleep is now necessary and rewardablelike Morthal or Dawnstarmeaning that you dont need to walk around all skyrim to sell the stuff 1000 septims was humiliating for a merchant TBHpretty simple but cool enough for meits weird not to see any battle along the way until you join one of the sides of the war With this mod you can find these fights while you walk around Make other kind of patrols availablelike the dawnguardsomething that i

they will probably tell you Ive spent more time modding the game than playing it at this point Mostif not allmods are available in both LE and SEand certain mods are still in the process of being converted from LE to SE if they havent already been convertedthe combat of Skyrim is pretty awfulparticularly the melee Closequarters melee combat doesnt feel impactful in that generally you swing a weapon at an enemy and unless it is a power attackyou wont really get a reaction out of them like a wince or a flinch The melee feels very floaty and otherwise unimpressiveyou have to go back and figure out which mod was the cause and why that mod specifically is the problem You shouldnt expect all mods to be compatible with each other so oftentimes you have to decide which mods you want and which mods you dont needbut differently each time as people continue to make mods for the game and you continue to add to your modlist and get sucked back in for one more playthroughI only wrote this

companionsso I made a run to Jorrvaskr in search of someone who still may be my friend The guards chased me throughout the citywith several of them hot on my tailI burst through the doors of Jorrvaskr and met the companions I was never so happy to hear Njada Stonearm call me useless This feeling of relief was shortlivedhoweveras a company of guards suddenly entered the room My friends all drew their swords and came to my defense After a lengthy battlethe guards all lay dead on the groundall of the companions went outside Wondering where they were goingI decided to follow them As I stepped outside into the harsh sunlightI witnessed a massacre The companions were murdering every hostile NPC in Whiterun Heimskr was the first to fall as Aela rammed her sword straight through his gullet The rest of the townspeople fled in terrorbut it was no use BelethorAdrianneeven Nazeemthey all were mercilessly slaughtered by the companionsI found a single survivor Brenuinthe town drunk and one of my

1,Really good game Cant stop playing You should support English language or open workshop for player so that we can translate to other languageWE NEED ENGLISHWe need English！！！！！We need English！！！Good game anyway but we player REALLY AND REALLY NEED ENGLISH TRANSLATION PLEASE Official English translation is available The devs have mentioned 90 is translatedbut I believe it wont impact gameplay Players who havent launched the game before will be switched to English automaticallyI can say its both good and bad It failed to meet my expectations but I still enjoyed the game and will recommend it The art is fantastic The combat is fun but lacking compared to other action  slash titles there is a lot they could do with it Quests arent very clear and their incentives are bad making it hard to get invested You dont get anything really unique or interesting from quests as far as Ive playedgathering and looting to acquire items that will either enable you to advance or give you a stronger statboost when you do advance Every realm does the same thingonly requiring different items at the new areas that open up for that realm This is a shame Progression is the area that has the most potential in this game and yet is the most tacked on partmostly an afterthoughtwith different gameplay mechanics for each one that ties into the unique aspects of the arearealm theyre in This would be a fantastic way to give a sense of freshness to each area the player explores and make them engage more actively in said area rather than rushing through it as we do nowits a shame I see so much potential that just isnt capitilised on Overall this is an experience Id recommend But Id only play it once in its current stateI cant read Chiniseeven though I bought this gamecustomizations and NPCs is colossalPlease do some rough translation to EnglishVery good cultivation game Game is rogue like with very high replayability Lots of reference to Chinese legends and folklore Many customization for your character with lots of items and skills You are also able to roll for your starting stats and inherent abilities Red is the best followed by orange and then purplebluegreen and greyromance themchallenge them to fightsincrease your XP together etc The NPCs AI is also well done where if they lose to youthey might bribe you to spare their life or threaten you with their relativesgood friends If you do choose to kill themtheir relatives and good friends will treat you like an enemy and will look for you for revenge if their level is higher than youThis game is  sweeeeet Get it Go into settings I think the 3rd button down on the main menu Once in the settingsgo into the language dropdown Its just under the checkbox There you should see English Once you select ityou will still need to restart the game for the language change Then enjoy this dank freshnessA good game to get into if you know how to read Chinese and have knowledge of Chinese WuXia MythologyGreat game but English would be awesomeI got a quest to kill a womenturns out her Dad and Husband are  times stronger then me They hunt me down and I had to keep escaping and using charms to avoid detection Goes on for a year or two I get caught and beat down The dad says I was too weak and pathetic to kill and left  Husband comes and murders me This was not worth the 350 odd spirit stones for her lifeEnglish version plzGreat gamealso theres an Unofficial English mod available check Discussions for this gameA highly addictive Xianxia simulator with awesome randomly generated charactersplacesand skillsan exemplary character relationship system idea that has a lot of potentialand a somewhat entertaining bullethellesque combat If I were to anagolize this game Id say it is a combination of Roguelikes with a lot of Random GenerationMount and BladeElonaTouhou Project and Dwarf Fortress Legends and Adventurer Modewrapped in the very popular theme of a Chinese Xianxia novelbut with much more breadth Each generated character has their own alignment scale how Righteous or Demonic they aretheir own likes and dislikes which you can consider when giving giftsand comes with their own family tree and relationship tree that outlines the rivalspeople they have a grudge againstfriendscompanionsparentsspousesmasters and disciples  allowing you many possibilities for ideas for roleplay and creating a story in your head as you playin my first playthrough when I first joined the demonic Sheng Xing Hong Holy Star Rainbow sect filled with many demonic characters despite my own characters somewhat neutral disposition Thereimpressed by my performance in the sects entrance duelsone of the sect seniorsthe venerable Kang Qin 70 years old offered to become my master I accepted hoping to receive guidance and training of the martial arts of fingers and lightning spirit arts But my master rarely checked on me as he was far too busy getting his ass handed to him by other righteous sectsand especially kept getting defeated by his rivals and enemies To make matters worseother members of the sect and other acquaintances kept coming up to me and badmouthing my mastercalling him despicableevil or hypocriticaladvising me to break ties with him Of course being a neutral fellow my character was I just agreed with all of themmaking many friends on the way at the expense of my Masters notoriety One daywhile I was breaking through the Foundation stage of cultivationI received news that he was finally slain by his rivalwhom I never even met before Come to think of it I only met my Master for a second time just after the entrance trials where he told me to work hard on my cultivation and development of my skills And so was the rather hilarious Masterdisciple relationship between meYu Tuo the agreeable fellowand Kang Xinthe old timer who kept getting humiliated by literally everyone around him including his own discipleXiahou Hanyun Intially she invited me to some leisure activities in a nearby pavilionand was impressed by my art of gift giving and defeating and sparing a rival of mine who killed me twice before and was quite shocked by me being alive after she slit my throat who insulted her and my appearance despite my high appearance stat XD From then onwe coincidentally met a number of times and grew in amiability Somehowshe ended up as the sects leaderand named me an honorary disciple as I moved on to another region to further my cultivation One thing that was very interesting was how Xiahou Hanyun had more of a demonic alignment but somehow still clicked with my slowly growing righteous characterwhich opened up many possbilities for thinking about their relationship I simply just explained it for myself that my character was a very carefree fellow though and my own character was not really as amiable to her as she was to mine perhaps due to the fact that I kept giving her cultivation breakthrough materials that I no longer needed My character and Xiahou eventually tied the knot in a snowy village of Feng Kou Phoenix Mouthand that was the start of all the badmouthing by strangers and other acquaintances pertaining to her demonic alignment What is even more hilarious to me is how the righteous sect I joined later gained me a few female admirersand when one invited me to a pavilion for leisuremy own wife came to find medemanding an explanation Thankfully she did not think that it was my fault and developed a grudge and enmity towards that female sect colleague who invited me there Such Shurabareminiscent of bullet hell games like Touhou Project but thankfully very much less intense  it allows a bit more room for customizationoffering you up to 4 different moves that have procedurally generated stats and effects alongside equipable passives that boost your abilities alongside pills you can buy or make yourself which can be more potent than those available in shops or stolen from people This system lies on top of 6 different martial arts swordspearbladefistpalmfinger and 6 different spirit arts EarthWoodWaterFireLightningWind  which have various types of moves eachallowing you many possibilities to mix and match and create your own build One lost opportunity though for builds which I hope the developers add more on is the cross compatibility of moves from different martial arts and spirit arts which only seems to apply to defensive passive skills for now which means that if you stick to one artyou will most likely only use that for the rest of the mid to late gameI was satisfied with this level of combat which provided indeed some challenge especially when fighting bosses midgameand sometimes beating a character whose cultivation stage is higher than you which is often very difficult using your own strategic build can be extremely satisfying A word of advice to those seeking to fight those of higher cultivation level  focus on dealing damage  criticals  optimize your build to activate Divine Power immediately as they can deal a ridiculous amount of damage even to higher level cultivatorsthere are still a lot of systems still not present such as FengshuiTalisman makingTool CraftingSect Management sadly you cannot become a Sect Leader yet etc that will be slowly updated as the game takes shape So faras it is I highly enjoy this game and am around halfway through Hua Shen stageand the gameplay loop is fun and challenging enough at midgame especially The music is decentand the artwork is very nice to look atespecially the world map cells which unfold like a neat Chinese painting I will perhaps update this review again when I am completebut if you read Chineseenjoy a good Xianxia novel or comiclove thinking about the inbetweens of character interactionsand love that neat random generation in roguelikes then this game is for youDONT KILL PEOPLETHEN ITS OKAYrandom people who attack yourandom near dead guys who seem to always attack if you help themetc You kill a guyhis entire goddamn family will inexplicably instantly know One of them will be stronger than him They will never forgive you no matter how many times you spare them You have to manually buy their forgiveness 1 at a time while under constant attack Kill the dude who is 1 step above the first guy Enjoy being attacked by guys 1 step above that Quite possiblyguys at a level literally not attainable in the game right noweffectively softlocks you unless you get the 1 skill for guaranteed escapes or reload every single month until you dont die and makes the game insanely tediousthe game feels similar to something like Elona Very similar gameplay loop Go to townget infinitely generated identical questsdo themuse resulting resources to get strongerused for buying stuff in townused for buying in sectwhere you can buy fruits to up your fireice or whatever skillsyour sect makes you an honorary member and stops you doing quests or buying at it But fruits are more expensive in later ones It feels entirely arbitrary and like being punished for progressing It should be EASIER to get these less important itemsnot 5 as expensive You make more points in later areasbut overallit feels slowerlike 50 or so blade to summon the avatar ultimate But not all sects have the fruits you may want And the option to leave the sect and go to another is hard to seeits generally pretty fairbut you can really tell the skills arent remotely balancedhit everything to deathmove on No one takes any hitstun And your base agility move speed is so low and cooldowns on dodges so insanely high that theres no real skill involved You just have good enough stats and winor dont and loselike blade and fist just give massive bonus like nearly 10 life steal and free shields in every room for having them equippeddo less damage and hit less enemiestotally invulsucking enemies indoing damage and able to act Most other dodges just make you dashyou cant use them until you do some arbitary task midfight Its a complete nobrainer to get this passivejust really tedious to reset for itso all this does is limit your options and make ultimates feel really bad unless you do Imothose passives should be removed and ultimates should just be castableyou get to pick a new ability But it doesnt just present them all to you Noit presents about 6 And you pick one of those And most of them are bad Incredibly bad Why would I ever want this garbagereally Bad  So you just sit there for potentially hours resettingsettle on a worse character as punishment for not wanting to deal with this tedium or use the chinese trainer like everyone else to just get the trait you wantyour progression is seriously messed upthe items used to just carry more stuffrequire ranking up a greater layer I dont get why this is Or why item limits are so low to begin with Its tedious You have near infinite storage in townsbut you can put everything away with a 3 spacial ringthen literally less than 10 mins later be full on items Its the worst item management Ive ever seen And since you constantly put everything in storageit becomes very easy to lose track of what you have Since while you DO forge in town and your storage IS in townforge wont use items in storagebut thats to be expectedits an EA chinese game But what is there is entirely understandablethe game has a lot of flaws Actually a lot more than I mentioned here But the core gameplay loop is fun The main flaw is entirely avoidable althoughto be honestI kind of WANTED to play an evil character And the balance issues are only an issue if you use the weaker options But I dont Because they suck So I dont really careWowI did not even know I played it for  hours in the go A perfect game with exciting future potentialif you are watching this single reviewplease keep adding the contents for higher cultivation like Gods and Immortals found in the novels nowadays I want to break through a realm to become cannon fodder again in a different world where even janitor is stronger than me and rise again to beat those pesky maggots as I did in my old worldjust like the neverending novels where the main character is just never enough powerful Please make it happen many more fans of the genre will come here if you can do thisEnglish translation is dopeand it is great that this time it was not botchedand there are many fans of this genre rising throughout the globe you guys will not be disappointed with the sales if you can tap into themWhile Im recommending this gameits mostly down to the fact that its an indie game that is being developed with good care by the people behind itand because has good playtime to price ratio Theres a lot of replayability in here which can allow you to tinker with various different builds The base foundation of the game is looking solidand Im writing this while keeping in mind that its still in EAand there will be more stuff addedthere are some points I didnt likeas is pretty much bound to happen in most games Here they areor from trying to be a do gooder and be in everyones good gracesor trying to woo  every lady you meet hark all ye harem wuxia novels out there D That saidto me at least there are two things that are most important in any sandbox game to feel worthwhile long termno matter developed by a small or large number of people The two things sound simple but Im sure anyone can imagine how difficult they would be in practice since they basically have limitless scoperealistically speakingwhat I can expect is that if I am a Grand Elder in a particular sectthat some pipsqueak kid of one of the disciples does not come to attack methen get defeatedand then threaten me that if I kill himhis mommy who is just a pathetic little disciple in the sect will deal with me Not going to happen kiddoand who is killing whom despite the said fights happening in the middle of nowheretheres heavy rng involved in particular thingswhich just multiplies the grinding exponentially Now I dont mind grinding if it is fun But here it is just too repetitive to be fun There will be a lot of loading screens youll have to go through if youre grinding a particular realm or for artifactsand the fact that this game has a moving timeline which saves every monththats also like a loading screen in itself considering the time it takes to make the save and give all alerts for the monthbut the game is still EA and translation is being worked onso Ill hold out on that Considering this is first cut translationits quite good I was hoping this would be the wuxia  xianxia game that would hit the sweet spot for mebut it wasnt to be Lets see thoughtheres more to come hereand if they improve some of the things mentioned aboveit could get closeish for me希望能出个MAC版本
1,Devplease hire a team This game is not allowed to perish under the physical limitations of a single human trying to work on it Brilliant but needs aggressive expansion before it disappears from peoples radarsI love it Kinda seen everything in it butI enjoy it Multiplayer games tend to have a short life span Particularly Indie onesdirectly related to the player base If this goes one month without Content updates which is very very very likely to happen players will drop ituninstalland find a better MP game to stay on Its a huge task to keep a MP game alivebut one can only hopethis might not be the best place to express concerns There is a discord httpsdiscordggQxvWuqX which is very active AlsoI understand that they update the game for bugs and fixes on a daily basisbut I am referring to content because that is what keeps players engagedhere is the Trellofor anyone who is interested in what is to come for this gameTeammates left me in a roomsaw a deformed child running at me and disappearspent the next five minutes sitting in a corner with a crucifix Highly recommendTutorial tells you that the ghost isnt violent but Im still too scared to complete it anywayPlaying soloI load up the school map for the first time I stop and appreciate how big and unnerving the map is I check my equipment I look around some more I realize that Im putting off going any further The phone down the hall rings After changing my pantsI start to hunt down where the ringing came from All the way down the hallhuh But the front door is all the way over hereand ohfine I track down the roompull out the EMF meterwhich immediately jumps to 5 I throw down my bookask the ghost to write in it wellwhat came out was Okaydothethinghurryupthen sort of moonwalk my way back down the hall while chanting variations of Nope One AltF4 laterand Im here writing this review Nothing even happenedI simply psyched myself out Now thats a horror gameBetter basketball physics than any NBA 2K seriesI asked where the ghost wasthe ghost only respond when youre aloneFirst time getting chase by a girlWhen you have to go in alone to talk to the ghostand your friend watches from the van  Give us a signGhostThis game is extremely fun to play Luckily my friends and I were looking for a coop horror game right at this time and I stumbled upon this game None of us regret it one bit Its very promising for an early access gameit doesnt rely on them very much at alland instead relies on the natural tension of largedark areas and the natural activity or lack thereof of the ghost in order to build suspense This meansfor me at leastthe feeling of dread doesnt end up wearing off and I can still feel genuine fear when going on a new missioneven if Ive been there 20 times beforewhile also letting those jumpscares still be somewhat scary A winwin in my bookbut boy was I wrong It creates a great experienceactively speaking to the entitytrying to provoke it to show you what it can dorisking your life for the missionbut its gotta be done Its thrilling and fills you with dread Having the mission react to the things you say is extremely immersiveone of this games biggest strengthsis huge in this game I always feel like I could actually be in the level Especially if you are playing in VRits hard to be ripped out of the experienceeven if youre fucking around with friendslike I was Being able to be the one in the truck tracking movement and and activity throughout the location is just as thrilling as wandering the house itself looking for activity Its been hilarious and immersive the several times my friend got impatient waiting for clues and went into the house to insult the ghost only for it to immediately lock the door and begin hunting him 00as the game basically JUST came out as I write thisand I have very little to complain about and feel very positively about this game and its futurebut these are things to keep in mindand that they may and will likely change in the futureyou can hold a video camera in your hand and carry it aroundand others can have a clear view of what youre pointing it at as you move through the house I would like to see this also become a feature for desktop playwhile you still can equip the camera and view itthe angle is very low and bobs sporadicallymaking things hard to see You can buy a headmounted camera that I assume fixes this I am not a high enough level to buy one yet so Im not surethen but them on your belt to use them handsfree I would like for at least the EMF reader to do something similarinstead of turning off when you put it away It makes a noise when you get a readingand I think that could staywhile requiring you to pull it out again to see exactly how strong the reading isI feel that would be a good compromisemy only 2 concerns right now are  placing cameras Currently you grip them by the left or right side in a set directionand its only different for each hand its held in It can make it difficult to place a camera facing a set direction I would like to be able to grip cameras from a front angleas well as from the topin order to make placing them much easier And 2 switching handscurrently you have to drop an item manually and catch it if youre fastor pick it up off the floor in order to switch hands if you dont have room in your belt Many other games allow you to grab object out of your other hand and I feel it would be very helpfulkeep in mind that Im writing this in very early accessso I expect this to change at some point Currentlythe only missions are identification Go infind cluesdeduce the ghost typeleave I Dont have a problem with map designbut I would like to see other mission typessuch as full on removalas the game talks about youthe identification teamdoing the research for a future removal teammissions like that would be great Another is finding out how the person died and became a ghostthe journal mentions a few times about death and people becoming a ghost Finding clues about the death of the ghost would be a very interesting mission design and Id love to see it come to lightwith my current understandingit doesnt matter until you hit 50 at which point the ghost becomes more aggressive against you This on its own is interesting and can be useful for drawing the ghost outbut I would like to see moresuch as hallucinationsboth visual and auditory Theres not much more I can say on thisanything I could is just as obvious as that so I wont botherand againexpect changes to thiswhen you dieyou become a ghost and wander the map as an invisible entity I think this has a lot planned for the futurebut currently thats all there is to it I think it would be extremely interesting if you could interact with the world in a similar way to the spirit your team is still hunting Things like flicking the lightswriting short phrases on wallsor maybe being able to speak in a ghostly filter for just a couple seconds to give them a cluewould be very fun and make it so youre not just a passive and clueless observer if you are killed If done in a way where it isnt always clear if the interaction is between the hostile spirit or your fallen friendit would be possibly the most unique thing Ive ever seen in a coop horror gamethis game is a steal at its current 5 priceand I got it on sale for less than 3 Even if you want to wait to play it when its more developedpick it up now I have no issues recommending this to anyoneand I anticipate a very bright future in those dark corridorsh What is Phasmophobia

of junk does get pulled over from mobile and often with an inflated price tag tooand often done quite lazilyit is a shining example of how to do it rightand just because it lives on mobileit CAN exist here toothis is obviously a Tower Defence gameso of course it works well on mobile screens Howeverit is not a lazy copypaste of other games It very much does its own thing and after at least 5 other main entriestheyve refined and added so much to make it a compelling and quite deep game all roundand the towers in this game are the monkeys who have different abilities YOu have your basics here  the basic single shot typethe area of effect blasterthe elemental or explosive attackers too But its more diverse than that Its by no means a simple rockpaperscissors that so many tower defence games  descend intowhere you have to preempt the next wave and build towers to suitthis game has monkeys which can only be used on certain types of land and in later stagesthe land gets rather minimal toohave really diverse capabilities to combat enemies like camouflaged balloons that only they will track or revealor metal balloons that require a sniper or cannon type to pierce So the balancing act here is much deeper and entertainingespecially when you get to harder difficultiesbeing the balloons themselvesand they are MANY Theres something lovely and cathartic about hearing shedloads of balloons get popped at onceand this lends to the enjoyment well Later waves will often become overwhelming instantly if youve made poor choices in tackling themas theres just that many that come in waves But despite thisits fair If you mess upyou learn what you did wrong and fix it next timetheres a basic levellingXP system where levelling up rewards you with XP points to improve your monkeys abilities slightly Againthis is a great help with harder difficulties and later mapsand I feel is REALLY well balanced You earn about at the right rate as you play Its so easy to get that bit wrongtheres added frippery like cosmetics and UI changes and so on if you wish for itas well as dailyweekly and monthly custom challenges and seasonal events These are usually rewarded with different skinsor heroes or sometimes new monkeys themselveswell paced and deep enough to keep coming back tobut it has enough there for repeated play even if you finish the main game which Ill point at out 60 hours in myselfI still have not finishedas tower defence games gothis is right up there with Defense GridSanctum and some of the other shining examples Dont overlook it as a mobile cash in because it isnt If you like tower defence you will absolutely love thisespecially if you like the cute aesthetic Ninja Kiwi seem well involved in keeping up interest with the events and challenges so I doubt anyone would tire of this quickly at allBRUH ITS LITERALLY 1 DOLLAR RIGHT NOW WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT REVIEWS GO BUY ITPicture thisjust played for almost 10 hours first sittingall i see is monkey

1,My Tottenham team bottled it in the final and Bale spent 6 months injuredbrilliant improvement from fm2but bring back the name of the player who made the assist after a goalSo realisticim in 23 and spurs still havent won a trophyMy wife left meAs alwaysthe newest version of FM is bit better than the earlier one I have played since 93 I think and still enjoy the game HoweverI dont purchase every new FMonly every second Last one I played was fm19 and fm17 before that It seems the developers are bit lazy for bringing in new features and removing or fixing features that dont quite work and therefore getting every second new version is enoughthey dont budge at all They offer something regardless of how well you have managed the team and asking even one tick more results them just offering the original sum until you either accept it or dont get new contract So you can make the team best in the world winning CL many times in a row and the salary stays at the sameor you leave Just a minor thing but annoyingthey should have little more effort than just updating the databaseConcede 95th minute equaliserlist9 of people who play FM buy every game anywaybut I thought I would do a little writeup of my thoughts after playing about 4 hours since I got 21band thank you for the awardsvotesi just want people to be as informed as they can be on a game i play so muchibut it is totally unrealistic to simply have an exact percentage figure on how fitsharp your players areand football in generaljust look a lot better in this engine In every previous game if you looked closely there was always something robot like about the players movementand glitches with ball movementetc I find that watching football in this engine is so much easier on the eyes in this gameit gives you a good idea of what a club wants for a player that is usually more accurate that your scouts ideaespecially if they simply say dont want to sellit will also give you an idea of how much the player actually wants to join you and whether contract negotiations could realistically succeedits clear and conciseI really hated the prematch tactical briefings from fm192thought they were completely uselessbut I simply cannot be bothered to gesture to the media to try and make them feel betterI think most players found the old UI perfectly usable and the new one takes some getting used to and doesnt have the same level of ease of access to informationbut no advice on how to create schedules for youthits pricey and not much changes year on yearbut realistically there isnt much more you can really add to a game with this much detail in it already If anythingI would like to see multiplayer be focused on a bit more by the devsbut the singleplayer product is still great as alwaysand you can easily sink hundreds of hours into this game without getting bored If you are a newer playerI would still recommend this gamebut only if you are willing to spend time learning about how it works and how to get the best out of your teamplayersbplease read this section h2you will need to do a lot of researchso b I have written this brief writeup for newbies bas well as research onlineto get the most out of it In terms of downloadsfacepackslogopacksskinsand kits are all things youll want to download and install to make the game look  feel much better and more realistic Ive realised that if youre a newer player to the seriesthere is so much stuff that youll need to look up to get the most out of the game Stuff like downloading training schedules and learning how to make your own is really important for player development Some elements of tactics such as team fluididy arent really explained that well ingame and are much better explained by people on the sigames forums  other fm sites Ingame shoutstoothese only affect player morale and dont affect your teams tactical approachbut this isnt told to you in the gameyoud only know if you researched it Personalities of staff  players are also iextremelyi important for player development  performancethis isnt emphasised in the game at allbut I would 1 recommend googling a guide to player personalities in FM21 Alsocreating good views ie squad views is really important to getting the most out of the game and getting information on players quickly I have a squad view on my workshop page which I find really helpfulthere are also many others availableI would recommend these sites for downloading addonsand advice on tactics and making the most of the gameas well as asking any questions you do have SIGames forumsFMScoutStrikerlessguidetofmcompassion4fmsortitoutsirfootballmanagergames25 Still no Super League 11I finally upgraded to FM21 after skipping FM19  2  mostly it was the xG feature that piqued my interestbut I also like to update every so often for little things like competition rulequalification changesrefreshing rostersetc Coming from FM18Ive been pleasantly surprised at some of the new features added in FM21  not only do I really enjoy the xG thingI love the overall improvement in what Id call realism The interaction with staff continues to get better and betterthe way staff and management present you with reports and call meetings is awesomeand the scouting meetings before transfer windows are so damn cool It all combines to make you feel like youre actually a manager and not just playing a game Im at around 23 hours of FM21 and Im still constantly finding myself engaging with new thingsId just like to share my experiencethoughts on scumsaving For the most part during my thousands of hours of FM over the yearsI felt like I was pretty fair about reloading matches  I only tended to do it if I had a bad injury to a star Id just signedor conceded a BS glitchbug goaletc Sometimes if I was having a bad day and fired up FM only to be down 4 to Man City in the 35th minute Id just CtlAltDelete and replay the match a few days later But with my new save in FM21Ive been experimenting with a strict nosavescumming policyand its added a whole new compelling element to my gameplay I had a real stinker of a game against Newcastle 5 I think  the sort of game Id have been tempted to reload in the past  and a day later my players refunded the supporters tickets for the match How cool is that I also got to within one bad result of getting sackedand had to get something away at Sheffield Utd  what a nerveracking match that was My boys pulled out a 31 win to keep me aliveand we had a short run of good form to finish the seasonallowing me to get the transfer reinforcements I desperately neededI felt it was well worth the money to upgrade from FM18 to FM21and if youve never experimented with a nosavescum policy  give it a whirl I think youll find it rewardingGraphicsThis game is like a toxic relationshipno matter how many times it hurts meI just keep coming back to itThis game made me fail school and collegethen it got me fired from my job It also ruined my marriage 11Gone from a 3 bed detached housea promotion and new wife To a bed siton the dollbut with a Gillingham side sitting just outside the playoffs in the ChampionshipBeen playing FM since 216I have thousands of hours in the game over the last 5 years I am extremely confident in saying that this is the best FM i have played so far The match engine has finally been overhauledgoal keepers behave like real people rather than Octodad in net Players will make intelligent passes and decisions in the final thirdand finishing has been vastly improvedIm a long time fan of SIs Football Manager games They are by far the best in the market for football managing sims Unfortunatelyyears have caught up to the software and it evolved into something elsehuge props to programmers having to deal with 2 years of legacy codedubious frameworks and all other challenges of preserving and upgrading this enormous project Development cycle of these games isnt long enough for meaningful changes and bug fixing Its very hard to come up with something newimplementing it and having it completely tested on a yearly basis which could lead into things getting very stale and unexpected exploits appearing There are also problems bleeding from one yearly version to next and so onor sometimes need to bring something new each yearthings get overly complicated and some features get gutted For examplein older versions corners were overpoweredso to make them more realistic we now have set piece routines that need to be set up before every single match if you want to have a chance at scoring them Of courseyou can save those routines but they are dependent on your players that you rotate almost every single match every season Training was very simple and somewhat effectivebut to add some sauce it got reworked and now its kinda impossible to mold players to your willimproving specific attributes needed to take them to a new level Meanwhile AI has almost free reign in developing their wonderkids Realism is used at will to justify many creative decisions Yet FM presents unrealistic scenarios all the time Not only in match enginebut for example with man management Would a player with loyal personality throw a fit after bid from a barely higher reputable team gets rejected Would professional personalities try to turn whole dressing room against manager for not getting a contract they required with astronomical demands To me at leastfun is much more important than the realismif thats how you wish to manage As time passes the games sadly boil down to recruitment having better players than the rest and going through the same motions which is inherently the biggest flaw of designing games like these Unfortunately they will eventually become a chore regardless of how fun the challenge startedyou will have to deal with disgusting demands of players and AI teams AI teams will lowball you when buying and rip you off completely when selling AI teams will trade fairly between themselves and players will accept much lower contracts compared to what they demand from you Worst part is that other teams will destroy your squad harmony and upset your biggest performers in order to buy themonly to not play them more than 1 games over 3 years before selling them on a bloated contractso they can blast a cross right into those defenders leading to corner number 53yesbut the amount of control and systems is simply very high and to play optimally you simply have to utilise them allyou could simply stack as much Brazilian and Argentinian wonderkids as you want To nerf thistheir wonderkinds became much more expensive and luxurious So to bypass thisyou simply resort to buying cheap ColombianPeruvianChilean all other South American really and Eastern European wonderkidswhole squad will turn against youmorale and player personality systems being completely out of whack Get out of CL groups as an Eastern European team for 4 years in a row Say that your goals is getting out of groups again in team meeting and they will jump their gunsget abysmal morale and whatnot thinking its unrealistic Every player no matter the personality is just a mercenary that will turn heel at first chance Theres rarely one club players among talented wonderkids possible if you are 5 star reputation teamand the only thing personality can tell you is how likely will those players improve in the future if they have potentialscouts judgement of players ability and potential gives almost exactly the same reports when that grade is above 9you will be punished Defensive tactics are terrible in this installmentleaking goals left and right with not much to offer in counter attacks Yet AI perfectly parks the bus when it needs Premade 4231 Gegenpress simply stomps the gamesometimes not even drawable Ive tried replaying those more than 2 times with many different tactics and results would be similardespite my lower level

created And their development is over when they turn 24 Achievements do not lead to stat improvements which I think should be a feature Its even realisticplease help me quitunrealistic gameFM  PES or FIFAHaving taken a World of Warcraft sized break from FMI grabbed FM2 cheap at the end of the game cycle and recaptured the addictionleading me to FM221but for the most part they are minor and related to my own personal idea of sim vs reality The engine is the best its been in the versions Ive played since 3d became a thing It has some quirksbut most of them are down to the engine showing a player acting a certain way but the visual representation isnt realistic enough to look at and sayI get why he did that For examplea player may not react to a ball over the top as swiftly as you would hope and it seems like an oddity of the enginewhen in fact its down to the player not having high enough concentration or anticipationso by the time the ball is in the air hes reacted too slowly and moved toward the ball when its already heading over himso Im still shocked when I finally hit the quit button and the time isnt 11PM but 3 AM If that isnt an endorsementI can only imagine youre completely

1,Awesome gamebut now I starve alone i liked the parts where i wasnt dying of starvation but did not like the parts where i was dying of everything elseI dont know what went wrong during developmentbut this is not a gameUPDATE This review is severially outdated and it will not be correct Sorry for this inconvienceI got really exictedTo the point where Ive gotten over 400 Days on a

friends arent quite as obsessed with it as i am Where do I start This game is great if you like survival games Its easy to get the hang of but it also has lots of challenging elements Playing singleplayer is pretty challenging and I dont recommend that for people who are new to the franchise The gameafter allis called Dont Starve TOGETHER Multiplayer is great If the host doesnt have a great connection it can be laggy 9 of the time the game runs fine online There are so many character mods and music mods in the workshop for this game that it never gets boring Whats even better is that when you buy the game you get a copy to give to a friend Overall I think this is a great survival game and I definitelyrecommend Dont Starve TogetherLOVE the fact that when you buy it it gives you a free copythe idea of the centuryNothing is more satisfying than minding your own business be it cooking or mining and having your friend start screaming over Skype and have a death message pop up at the top of your screenHop on first server I seemake your own camp if you dont like itall my materialstools ect goneThis is the first game that I have ever written a review I have never gotten bored playing this game You have many option to play the game either with friendaloneor random Unlike other gamethe community is not toxic at alland I have seen many nice people willing to teach the newbie even though they are not friend In conclusionthis game is very fun to playand the creator update the game very oftenand they create many events for the community to enjoyso I recommend to get this game even you dont have friend because you will meet more people and become their friend once you play it
1,I was looting the barracks in Zelenogorsk when I hear a gate being opened behind meI turn and see a wellequipped player dealing with a zombie I have a gun in hands and the advantagebut my entire current playthrough has been rather peacefulso i opt for a nonviolent solution I duck behind the corner of a barrack and yell over direct chat that I dont want to kill himand i circle around a stone wall trying to avoid line of sight He answersbut it is intangible I cant see him anywhere but I assume he went to the barracks 1st person server btw I try my best to not get in an awkward position and run up into the second floor of a house overlooking the military site By the time I get there i can see that he has indeed closed the door in the prison buildingbut fuck it I run up to the prison building and say Im friendly and just wondered if we could do some tradebut Im determined that my friendly intentions will serve me wellI enterhe is pointing at the door with an AUG Its when i get closer to him that i see a second man with an AUG in the staircase I explain what Im trying to get and midsentencea friend of theirs come in He was likely watching the entrance After a little meetgreet the say sorrydont have any mags I say thats okayand we agree that we wont go the same direction afterwards lest we run into each other againsomewhere in the forestIm shot in the leg Pants ruinedbut legs not broken I very briefly get some vietnamlevel flashbacks to the time my roommate taught me the basics of ARMA and combatand I jump behind a tree instead of just turning around I count down from 10 and regain my breath My M4 is equiped with an ACOGand the shooter must have been about 100150 meters awaymoving as quickly and safely i can while preserving breath I finally get to him and see hes unconsciousdonning a black skull balaclava Im angrybut not disappointed this is the nature of the game While i still have him alive and able to hear meall i can get myself to yell was I TRUSTED YOU before I shot him Looting his bodyI find 3 ak74 magsan ammo box full of the right ammoan LRS and some decent stores of food All in allmost intense thing Ive had happened the last few months1 load inPretty funbut very sad Met a Russian guywe became friendseven with a language barrier We played with each other for a while Then I got shot in the head And I never got to see him again If youre out there man let me know I miss youI entered a house looking for some food when I heard some footsteps outside The guy said hey and entered the houseI said hey backand he hit me with a hammer This was the beginning of a beautiful talethe tale of the Shoe GangI finally stopped and turned around to see if I was being followed by the crazy hammer man As I stood therehungry and demoralisedI heard behind youbehind youand up came running another playermuch friendlier than my previous encounterand he charged offLets get this mother fuckerwe ran at the hammer manwho after seeing our number had doubleddecided to take a more diplomatic approachand explained he simply wanted my shoes for his friend Little did he know that I had just found the most pristine pair of shoes in the house where we first metthe three of us teamed up in search of the finest shoes for the hammer man’s friend We searched high and we searched lowbut there were no shoes to be found Finallywe met up with the shoeless manwhose shoes certainly were in a state of disrepair Unable to tolerate the toes of the bare footedthe four of us left town and made our way across the countrysidewe encountered another survivor He had a nice hatbut we werent there for hats He was clearly uncomfortableand he was right to beas the hammer man had been stashing a secret pistol this whole time We were explaining our need for shoes when the hammer man went for the killthe gun went to the back of the man’s headhammer man pulled the triggerand he completely missed the shot Listening to hammer man’s accent he appeared to be Frenchwhich for mean Englishmanexplained his inability to handle a firearm at 3 centimetresand the rest of us piled in with our fiststurning the guy in to a battered mess We were careful not to hit his shoesbut it turned out that he too was wearing worn footwear Howeverit was enoughand our friend fitted the loafers over his aching toeswhen the guy I met after the hammer man announced that his shoes were now unfit for purpose Our thirst for shoes was not yet satiatedand we moved on in search of the next pair of clogsmy new friend had to goleaving myselfthe hammer man and his friend to fend for ourselves The Shoe Gang were hungryand so we holed up in an abandoned house to hide from the rain that had started to fall and munch our way through some beansand we pushed onthe scent of leather driving us through the forests We took part in some fishingsat round a fire cookingand discussed our shoe filled fantasiesthe sound of wolves filled the air We were outnumberedand our shoes were worn out They were upon us in the blink of an eyeflailing his gavel relentlessly as the beasts took him I attacked the alpha wolf with a big stick which only seemed to anger him Soon everything began to fadethe blood loss was traumatic and I slipped in to darknessand I have no doubt that they took all of our shoesVery Positive  15 Mostly Positive  25 Negative  45bThis game sets a perfect example of how to do everything wrong in software developmentbplease keep in mind that this  like any other review out there  represents my opinion about this game and mine alone Since the game is still in developmentmy criticism is mostly pointed towards the acutal development of this game rather than the game itself There might be a one in a 1000 chance that I might change this review around by the time the game gets officially releasedIve given up hope on this We my family started playing about 2 years ago and it really wasnt bad back then Of course there were bugsthings were incompletebut thats to be expected from an Early Access gameas Ive been closely monitoring the development progress of the gameI see so many things going wrong in the development teamI almost feel the urge to take a planefly there and put some people in their place and teach them a thing or two about prioritiesthe game is far worse than it was 2 years ago In a long period of timeBohemia managed to keep implementing content to keep the players happywhile they shouldve been working on enginerelated systems instead iNow they have to refactor every single piece of content to make it fit with the new enginei As an engineer myselfI know how much time and effort this takes The person responsible for prioritizing content over enigne should be fired and never to be allowed in game development againyou might notice that the team works in an agile method using sprints We do the same in our office Howeverusually there is one person responsible for prioritizing tasks and planing them ahead This person clearly thinks from a business perspective instead of something to improve the quality of life of the software maintainabilityeasyadopting and stabilityand it hurts me to see this happen to a studio like thisa lot of much better alternatives got released in the meantime Im not here to advertize or suggest anything in particular since I gave up on these types of games after the horrible taste in my mouth that this game gave meIm guessing there is less than a handful of actual programmers on the teamfloatingflying buildingsetcyou bloody FIX ITto answer the question if I would recommend this game to ANYONEheres the proper way to port a game to a different enginethe DayZ mod for Arma IIgo early accessAND NOT BEFORE THATimplement content  finish the gamepeople with absolutely NO EXPERIENCE in software engineering in general had leadership over the development of this gamebig kudos to the team thats been there since day one All the negative crap they get over themselves right now would completely ruin any form of motivation to even keep working on the game for meI have owned DayZ SA since it was announced I bought it the instant it came up for sale on the steam store Before thatI played hundreds of hours in the various modsmost of that was due to the time I spend commiserating with friends when the game didnt work as intendedwritten reviews about this game for the subredditargued with peoplegone back and forth between loving and hating itno faith in the devs and renewed faithwhen they announced that the game would be LAUNCHING out of EA at the end of 2018I was genuinely apprehensive and unsure as to the future of this game At that moment I knew the devs had lied to ushad lead us onand ultimatelyhad no intentions of finishing this game in the way that was promisedvehicles have ALWAYS supposed to be in the game For the first 23 years they were NOT in the game The game was barebonesand when they finally added vehicles they were broken in the same way some of the mod cars were brokenbroken Vehiclesbroken Hit detection during firefightsbroken Inventory system is such an obtuse mess its BROKEN Core features of this game remain in limbo and as you play youll find that youre jimmy rigging and finding loopholes to combat the broken features just to get them to semiwork in your favordid you read to comprehend what I saidor just skim past and find all the bits that made u madthe modding scene for SA was just starting to really take off About 6 months after that and its now thriving  mods make this game playable Ive said that from the start Its all I played during the first iteration of DayZits all I said would save SAand thats exactly what happenedThis game has been in alpha for 4 yearslet me tell you what I did in four yearsa cook and a security officer for 3 different companies6 Years ago I bought this game It was shitty and full of desync and bugs And yet everyday I found myself playing for hours upon end The reason thousands of players just like me keep coming back to Dayz is for the amazing player interactions and experiences Its unlike no other game I have played 6 years ago I met 5 people in a town called elektrostill play with them to this dayand a couple of months ago I got to meet them in person while attending one of their weddings I will always come back to Dayz because there is simply no other game like itgrind for 10 hoursdie in 10 secondsEDIT  READ UPDATE AT THE ENDyou will love this Havent played the mod WellI will say that this game is grape Yepgrapemost

 It saddens me because I still love the game but I cannot heartily recommend it like I once didgo for it  Otherwise youd be wise to save your money for another gamepeople who play this have walked

1,My entire colony was saved by a tortoisegoing over the pros and cons Rimworlds a story generatorso I thought Id share my story I bought rimworld around two weeks prior to writing thisand set up a small colony The first animal my colonists tamed was a 212 year old tortoisewho I named Old Timer We set up a small farmand once we found a female tortoise who I named Henrietta Peachthey had kids And their kids had kids Soon enoughI had too many tortoises than I knew what to do withso i tried selling themand the nearby colonists loved them But things took a darker turnmy IRL dogof 15 yearspassed It was sadbut what hit extra hard was old timers death only a few hours later Both were blindboth had bad backs  it hurtand I cried I dug a big tomb in a mountain for old timerand laid him to rest in it But this is not where his story endsI got a quest with a ressurection serum as a reward In that momentI knew what I had to doas the end goal of my playthroughbut I sure as could save this turtle Old timer was going to spaceI needed a way to keep old timer from dying all over again while I aquired the supplies for the ship Luckilyan ancient ruin was on my mapand after an intense fight with some killer robotsI safely placed him in a stasis chamber the robots were guardingand over the four or so years it took me to complete the shipold timers children numbered over 500 i made regular trips to the nearby towns to trade tortoises for the ships supplieslike plasteel and uraniumand at long lastI placed old timer in the nowfinished ship and turned the reactor onrimworld basically becomes a sort of wave defense gamewith a new posse of enemies coming every day for 15 days or so while the reactor charged This wasnt a big deal  I had troops in power armor with minigunsand we made it to the end of the 15 days without any deaths Right as the reactor was at full powerand I told my colonists to enter the shipthings took a dramatic turn A solar flare knocked out all my defencesleaving me without any kind of fire support I hurredly got my colonists in the shipbut right as the last one was making his way across the fields to get to itwhen salvation came in a way I hadnt expected A tortoise number 49to be precise didnt take too kindly to someone coming out of the sky and attempting to shoot his keepersand bit a pirate enforcer on the leg This caused the pirate to hit him with his cluband after that the OTHER pirates started shooting the hundred or so turtles in the basewho promptly attacked back Andin the ensuing chaosmy last colonist boarded the ship and we escapeda blindcrippledundead tortoise repaid me for saving his life  by birthing countless decendants to not only fund my escapebut who also protected me in my darkest hour of need This game is a giftand I cannot reccommend it enough Even if you reload saves to keep the story going how you wantits still a story worth tellingFull underground basechemfuel stored in a granite room with no cables in the walls so I figured it was safea Zzzt event set a colonist on fire who fled into the chemfuel stockpilethe stockpile exploded destroying the wall between it and the hallwayeven the coolers caught firethen the food caught fire The communal hall included all the hallways that went throughout my base ironically to make temperature control easier so there was no way to get out of the base other than to go through the communal hallthree caught fire in the halls before reaching the shelter of the adjacent roomsthose already in those rooms caught fire as they were dying of heatstrokethe communal hall reached over two thousand degrees CelsiusI still get misty when I remember my pet raccoon Willy  Willy had already lost all four legs defending me from prior attacks by bandit raiders  We came under attack again and the raiders made it inside our base and a bandit cornered me in my bedroomI was finished for sure  Willy wriggled on his belly across the floor and bit the ankle of the bandit who began shooting at Willygiving me time to charge the bandit and take him down but Willy had been shotbut he was critically injured and dying  We rushed Willy to the medical bay and managed to stabilize him  Not only would Willy livewhile in surgery the doctor was able to attach four new wooden peg legs  When Willy was awake and healed he was able to scamper across the potato fields on his new wooden legshero and protector of our villageb I felt like I had to share my experiences with RimWorld so far 	bAshton a quite ironical name in the end  The basic needs were all coveredeveryone had a nice place to sleepdecent clothingenough to eat and time to relax The people of Ashton were prosperous They lived in harmony with nature and each other Their wide fields provided them with plenty of food and they sold the surplus to the passing by caravansthe Pig Face Menattacked the settlementbut the people of Ashton were saferelying on the strength of their automated defence systems And so the colony grew and I thought This is itI finally have a colony which doesnt collapse after a few hoursmost were friends and there even was a married coupleTali and Waltzeating only those animals which died by natural causes eg old age or other animalsso the animal population in the near forests remained stable So far so good But taking those dead animals in meant of course someone had to leave the safe area of Ashton and wander through the wilds Normally that wouldnt have been a problemeveryone was equipped with guns and armor of the Pig Face Men so they were quite ready to take on anything coming in their waywhen a tortoise nearby turned mad I thought okthose arent that fastWaltz will be able to safely carry the chinchilla inside and the turrets will take care of the tortoise b Nope	b Im not quite sure what exactly happenedmaybe this animal was on speed or something like thak Anywaywhen it saw Waltz it charged at him at a horrifying pace Waltz had just lifted his weapon when this damn creature reached and hurt him badly Howeverits hard shell was no match for Waltz gun And so he came back homeinjured but happythat now there was even more meat than expected But the wraith of the tortoise was unforgiving The bite wounds in his upper body infected themselves The medical treatment didnt work and he got weaker and weaker If the infection at least wouldve been in one of his limbsthat might had saved himbut you cant just amputate someones chestthe infection overwhelmed him Talihis wifecarved his story in the sides of his sarcophagus The burial ceremony was heartbreaking Everyone had come Talihis sister Juliahis friends VasJonesStephanBoyd and LeiaVas tame wolf Nevile and Bacon 1 and Bacon 2 In the light of the evening sun they all waved a last goodbye to their fallen husbandbrother and friendbefore the people of Ashton went to bed With Waltz dead or notthey had to cary onnot very surprising if you think about it There was only this one little problem She was a pyromaniac When the rest of the colony sleptshe left her big and empty bed Driven crazy by griefshe did the only thing able to ease her pain She set the forest on fire Finallyexhausted almost to unconciousnessshe fell back into her bed againthe otherswaken by the crackling firedesperately tried to put out the flames which already started to spread over to the buildings But they simply werent enoughthey could either try to save the buildings or the forestnot both Of course they tended to the buildingsto the food storage to be exact However it gave the fire the chance to spread through the forestcompletely sorrounding the settlementJones and Boyd followed when they collapsed in the infernal heat And thenwhen no hope was leftthe godsthe ancestorsthe Flying Spaghetti Monster or whatever thi people of Ashton believed inheard their cries Rain started falling downputting out the fire But it was too late More than three quarters of the colony had been taken by the flames VasStephan and Leia were unconcious Julia was the only one still able to stand She did what she couldbut with all the medicine burned she had no chance Leia died firstVas second This caused his wolf Nevilewho had been laying loyal by his sideto turn mad like the damn tortoise and he ripped the still unconcious Stehpan into pieces before he went on attacking a herd of muffalos some kind of marshmellow like buffalos which was his endwho managed to flee when Stephan was killedwandered through the burnt ruins of Ashton Blackened stone walls and pieces of charcoal everywhere All the food they stored for the winter was gonethe fields empty With no medicine left and her own wounds hurting worse and worseJulia found a last smokeleaf joint in one of the destroyed buildings She leant against her brothers sarcophagus and lit it So she didnt feel anything when the Pig Face Men attacked With the solar panels a loss to the flamesthe turrets didnt react when Ashtons last inhabitant finally exhaled her last breathIf youre thinking of buying this gamestop hesitating and purchase itimmediatelyas a 74yearold sociopathic scientist called Geckulon Decktar I researched robotics to begin withand constructed some automatons to handle the menial tasks like cleaningcooking and haulingetcleaving me free to conduct my research All was well until a band of savages laid siege to my settlement I barely survived but resolved to increase my securityinstalling several autoturrets around my perimeter This would keep the ruffians at bay for a timebut I needed a longer term solution so I turned my focus to bionic enhancementsI did not hesitate to inspect their wares I wanted a slavebut not just any slave he should be forebodingbrutal and utterly without mercy And that was when I found him His name was Skint Mcgruff He was a feared crime lord when they captured himinfamous for killing and then devouring the people who wronged him I paid the slavers their due and took Skint in I fed him alasnot the human meat he desiredbut nutrient pastemade from potatoes poor farebut such is life in the frozen wastes and I clothed himand so I presented the idea to him the very next day He was keen particularly about the notion of having retractable claws and so the work began My medical droid handled most of the surgerybut I crafted the bionic components myself It was a long and grueling processbut eventuallyhe was complete More machine now than manI felt it necessary to rename him to symbolise his departure from prosaic humanity to something moreand thus I named him CANNIBAL Cybernetic Armoured Neutraliser with Neurally Integrated Bionic Attack Limbs He is my pride and joy bionic eyes that can see even in the darkbionic legs that allow him to sprint faster than a cheetahand retractable claws with which to tear out the throats of my foesand of courseI give him leave to feast on their corpses afterward as a rewardI can finally conduct my research in peaceNine cats wandered into my colony and I was happyskinnedand cooked eight of the cats to survive out of desperation and I was sadcausing a fire that killed the final cat and I was angryLets say you capture a prisoner after a bloody raid on your colony Do you want towhat else do you need in a gameIve played RimWorld for ieasilyi over 1000 hours aside from the 160 hours on record for my accountI really should have reviewed it sooner since Ive played it so longbut I never got around to itso thisll include my experience in the gamewhats good and badand everything youd likely need to know before getting itits very interactive and youll always have something to dobe it planning a new room for your basebuilding up defensescreating a more reliable food source or even raiding enemy factions At first its very daunting as there is a lot to get used tobut each new discovery comes with a new way to experience the gameyour story is always your own and itll never be the same as beforelending this game to nighinfinite replayabilityand thats not even considering mods which are abundantrelatively easy to make yourself and very active The developers constantly revise and improve aspects of the game improving it more and more as time passeseven your own ideas may be implemented if theyre good additions to the game The community is one of the best Ive seenwhere people joke aroundshare their playthroughs and wacky happenings whilst generally having a good time I recommend this game if you like strategytackling positivenegative turn of eventsplanning thingsand sandbox style survival games If youre still on the fence for buying the gamewatch a lets play video and see madness that can occurcheck out all the mods that are available and imagine the possibilitiesit really is a great gameat first it may be a turnoff but the style works well with the gameplaywith the attention you need to pay to so many things on screen its good that the textures arent complexas itd strain your eyeswhereas this style is soft on the eyes and doesnt impede the gameplaythings represent what theyre meant to beand its surprisingly easy to get immersed into the game with the simplistic graphicsthere is no set storyso things can go in any directionyou could have a trader caravan arrive to sell items just as a raid occurscausing a massively shoot out between two major groups just outside your baseafter which you can mop up all their valuables and turn their corpses into meals and skinmaybe for that human leather hat youve always wanted Perhaps you start brewing beer only to have one of your pets drink some and get addicted to alcohol Story is incredibly well done in this gameand with how fun it can be Im surprised lots of other games dont use the same stylethe sounds work for their intended purposestheres nothing spectacular to talk about nor is there anything uniquethe sound it has is rightbut its not something the game is well known for and isnt made to contribute a lot to the gamefor the style of game this is a scifi colony sim Id say the gameplay is near perfectand it can be perfected to a players liking with modsa lot of features from popular mods are incorporated into the game over time so the base games gameplay will get even better over time Things are placed using the UI at the bottom of the screenand your colonists with build them if they have the resourcesthey can get the resources from your setting up of work orders like cutting down treesmining rocksbutchering animalsharvesting plants and various other ways Its almost like youre the architect of a colonytelling them what needs to be done and when it needs to be doneits quite nice as luck is a big factorbut foresight allows you to somewhat control your luckand mitigate disastertheres little thats more satisfying than diverting misfortune with a well thought out plansome change the game entirely like changing the spacecowboy style theme to that of Lord of the RingsMedievalWW2 era and many otherswhilst others change  add to the games features and toolsallowing for you to adjust anything you dont like into something you do likeand the modding community is quite activeif theres a good idea for a mod then its likely already madeIf you choose to buy it then I recommend trying the base game without mods firstas whilst they add a lot to the gamethey also take away from the main themeplaying it without mods will help you understand the fundamentals a lot quickerbut how they come together makes it a 910 for mesince RimWorld is the best game of its typeIve looked long and hard for other games like itand Prison Architect is the only game similarbut to me it doesnt have the random glory that RimWorld has RimWorld is certainly worth £0hell its worth £50 to me since Ive got so much entertainment out of itother games you may play for 200maybe 00 hoursbut this is one of those games which you can sink months intoand games like that are worth buyingI dont often write reviews but this game is just so good that I cant help but share my opinionIve been playing this game for the first time and I want to share the story of how I realized its kind of amazinga female trader named Onesandied nine years after founding the colony The story of her life on the planet is what amazed me and it convinced me this game is something special It actually made me a little emotional None of what Im going to say is fakethis all happeneda 16 year old K pop starand her best friend Augusta miner Min died early on from injuries she took during a caravan ambush Barely a year later August bled to death from injuries she received during a very bad pirate raid on the colony Onesan broke down often in the early yearsSteel Onesan and Steel had a very rocky courtship They went through two years of awkward back and forth flirting before Steel finally won her over But after three years of marriage Steel was seduced by another colonist and Onesan separated from him Despite Steels cheating she never broke down again She couldnt afford to She was the colonys lead trader and negotiator She was always busyconstantly on the road between her colony and the friendly one nearby During the periods when she wasnt on the road she tailored clothes for the rest of the colony Steel stayed on his side of the colonyworking on his armor and weaponsSteel broke up with the other colonist while Onesan had been away on her last trip Steel and Onesan got back together and for one more year they enjoyed each other more than they ever had beforefar away from the colony A large pack of manhunting arctic wolves entered the map almost on top of her Onesan was ripped to shreds and bled to death before Steel and everyone else had even left the safety of the walls to go save herOnesan deserved the best possible funeral A catacomb was excavated for her deep inside the nearby mountain and a solid silver sarcophagus was placed inside for her to rest in Steel constructed the sarcophagus for his wife personally It was excellent quality5509but Onesans death did not make Steel upset I know she was important to himthough He would leave his work at the machining bench to visit her sarcophagus all the time Hed always be there for a long timestaring down at it Ive been paying closer attention to him since Onesan died and as far as I can tell he hasnt flirted with any of the other colonists since her deathslowly unlocking the path to the starsbut instead of going with them he will stay behind on the planet to be with herDont get into moddingi have 52 cats every winterwe run out of foodand my colonists starve the cats eat their bodies and last long enough until the next summer if we are lucky a raid of many tribal men will arrive and the cats will have food for months the cats have kittensand then we have more cats and need more food i do not think we will leave this planetthe original pet of the colony has been made fully bionic and will now never die he is our true leaderHeavily recommended game And the following playthrough should make you either highly appalled or very interestedbut later on my pet monkey took a liking to another guy named Bones It made me a tiny bit sadmade the entire surroundings and buildings out of the easiest findable supply around woodso he was always running around naked which was not appreciated by some But apparently he had a passion for farming and was well endowed Greta took the earliest opportunity and showed him some loving Greta was listed as a lazy and weapon hating personbut not too lazy to chase down some bone Good for hernamed Adantewas a tireless fat miner and the other two people named Dorothy and Hunter were your average run of the mill converted prisoners from earlier battles Dorothy could cook up some decent meals and Hunterwellas the name implieshe was hunting down the animals for the food to make nice meals mixed up with the harvested crops from our farms Luxurious and plentiful meals of variety Even salt was added for flavourthe pet Monkeyand I did not notice as I was looking to mine some shizzlethe pet monkey had all her limbs bitten off by the snake and was crying for help while still being pounded by the Cobrabut heyhe loves being naked and probably didnt want to risk being bitten in dangling places so did nothing to help outhowevereventually shot  killed the cobra before it could put a killing blow on the poor limbless cryin monkeycarried and put in Bones room to keep him comfortable with some painkillers while we figure out a way to get his limbs back There are ways in this game to do sobe it four wooden pegs or made out of other technologybut it takes some craftmanship to pull this offan electric storm came down on the settlement as if it was telling us YOUR INTENTIONS ARE NOBLE BUT THE MONKEY MUST DIEheres a lesson Ive learned Never make your ENTIRE settlement out of woodand spread from the storages and houses straight to the farm area and all over the entire mapall animals and trees on the entire map were burned alivethe house in which Butters was still recovering was also hit by the fire I sent my main character Adante to help out but the fire enclosed the area in a rapid speed My fat miner and his slow jigglywiggly runs could not win that race by a long shot He was a haulernot a speedy gonzalezthe poor cursed monkeyjust shrieked and screamed her lungs out when the fire was getting closer and closer after every secondwe could hear the cries againof a pet Monkey Not only in pain from snake bites and losing all limbs beforebut now also jumping by the belly up  down inside her once comfortable petbedbeing on firesince hes supposedly the new master of Buttersgo into the flames and try to retrieve the monkey while the plan was to let him carry the monkey into the water at a nearby lakewhile both being on fireinto what it seemed a neverending sea of flames and emotionI stopped playing and told the story to my girlfriend Her eyes opened wide and then the question came What kind of fed up game is thatmy dear Its Rimworld true storyIve been fiddling around with challenging game modes rather than the stock three So I began a game with absolutely nothing other than the starting colonistno foodno weaponno silver Ive then opted then to go for a mountainous region cause its easier to defend from attackersnormally what happens now is you get to choose your colonist I thought Righti want a good minersomeone who can farm relatively well and I guess a good fighter to start off with Off I go cycling through the colonists where I stumble upon Patrice Patrice was shit at everythingIm talking zerosones and twos across the boardwith the exception of Art which was seven and Social which was bloody eighteenhow the hell does she have such a high social skill so I read her backstory Now Patrice was just twenty years oldvery young but she had done so much Patrice wanted to sing for everybodyluckily for herDad was the CEO of an interplanetary corporation and set her up as a Childhood Idol Patrice sang her poor heart out for everybody and made her parents proud Until her mum dieddad was beside himselflost in his thoughtsPatrice at this stage was developing into a woman and offered herself to dad as a replacement for mum which he acceptedGive us your daughter or we go public with whats been happening between you tworuining both your lives in the process Dad agreed and sent poor Patrice awaywhere they used Patrice for a new kind of jobif you know what I meansay hello to Patrices adult background Pornographic Idol Yes you read that correctlyPatrice was now sold into sexual slavery But it wasnt all that badshe wasnt a typical whore as it wheremore like a Companion from Firefly where she selected her clients She became very popular amongst the nobility of the region Attended balls and had a cult followingmuch like her childhoodI had to try to help Patrice live a better life Off we went to Patrices new home Im assuming at this stage shes been rescued by some unknown benefactor AnywayPatric lands right in the centre of a small clearing surrounded by mountain with only one opening and fertile land within that area too Score I thought as I got her to work setting up a shelterbed and torch Bloody hell wasnt this a task for her It took two days to complete this menial task but together we persevered Eventually she completed this task cutting down a dozen trees in the process and skilling up two levels in constructionCrap I had to get her to safetyfortunately this rabbit tired itself rather quickly and left Patrice alone after it slept I got Patrice to fashion herself a club to use and just in the nick of timewell I say nick of time but it took her a whole day to get this done too At this stage she hasnt even gotten to setting up a farmluckily there are heaps of wild berries aroundas they are leaving sirens roar as were under attack The attacker has a shivloves to fight and has eight skill Were finished I think as the attacker runs down towards the village but attacks the visitorthe visitor manages to put a solid slug into the attacker but is killed in the process The attacker is wounded but proceeds to move towards PatriceI order Patrice to stay behind the door ready with her club The attacker busts the door down and charges in but after suffering from blood loss Patrice is able to knock him out with a single swing from her clubtalk to people You see what normally happens is these attackers are hard as nails to recruit to your villagewith some taking days and even seasons before joining your communityPatrice didnt even need food to entice himas soon as she walked into the room he instantly switched sides and became Patrices bitchPatrice settled into her new roles as town artist and socialitewhile minion one got to work erecting a wallfinishing some farmland and contructing a kitchen and dining room for Patrice to enjoyall in a days work as it werenow she had a minion to dominate she finished everything with precision and haste She developed a taste in gardening as the minion went to work digging out the tunnelsconstructing two cells for conversation duties and completing a new throne room and Queens chambers for Patricenormally I would look purely at the stats of a character to pick them for me but Patrice has changed my attitude herenow I look at the stories these colonists have as the main driving factor in selecting themlisting Rimworld for GOTYplayed a touchshes still aliveHad a colonyGREAT colony Had Olga the spythe fucking bestonly one person I left behind could fight firesJess the cook The caravan lead by Olga finds the dudefixes him and they get dragged back after a extra day of getting split up before returning to the colonyat the main basea pack of MANHUNTING RABBITS decided to swarm the colony No big deal All the rabbits get funneled in and get slaughtered Acouple people get bit and have to be patched up So lots of people are sleeping off being covered in rabbit bites Suddenlytheres a heat wave Lots of rabbits lying in the open on the floorsand people spend all night stuffing rabbits into the freezer before they rot They go to sleep latewhatever There wasnt alot of meat leftbut not before the fire has already spread into the warehouse and then subsequently to the lower housing area that happens to have wood floors and all wooden beds Jess is attempting to fight the fires alone for hoursbut not before it becomes too much and begins SUPERHEATING THE FUCKING COLONY to 1400 degrees in certain rooms He has to take breaks running in and out of the compound as he tries in vain to fight the fire Finally its called to just let the colony burn Everyone evacutes the buildingit can be rebuilt But not before people get trapped inside Colonists braving the superheated building attempting to find fallen comrades pull them outside while receiving burns from the superheated aira billow of smoke is seen The returning colonists who dont fear the fire begin fighting it as best as they can The warehouse is lost at this pointbut losing the fridge would be a death sentence They lock up in the fridge and begin putting out fires as they

cold You can do this in different ways such as crafting them the right clothingand having heaterscoolers Your colonists need to eat You can have them eat raw humans and animals like savagesor you can have them butcher animalsand cook different meals so that they can stay healthy You need to build a freezer so that your food wont deteriorate You need a medical room for the best effective chances of successful operations and treatment Youll need to build wind turbines and solar generators so you can give power to the things in your base that require it You need to build a research bench and

are still accurateI must say that it comes with a massive disclaimer If you just play Brawlhalla with your friends and never take it seriouslyyou will likely enjoy yourself Howeverif you ever get good at this game and play at a decently high levelBrawlhallas glaring failures as a fighting game will become so unignorable that your desire to play it will steadily decline till youre on the subreddit crying about the passive float meta like everyone else All of the reviews  including the negative ones  are ignoring the real problems with this gameand its something I have thought about for a long time SoIll try to explain my reasoning as best as I can and briefly include the reasons why I still consider it worth downloading despite its enormous flawsBrawlhalla is an entertaining party gameprovided you have some friends to play it with Soif the only thing youre looking for is a simple game to kill some time read 1500 hours withdownload it It is very easy to play and you are practically guaranteed to pick it up quickly regardless of your fighting game experience Aside from being easy to playit is also free to play and only cosmetic items cost moneyso it is easy to get into as well There are a good number of modes for you to play with your friends to prevent it from getting stale You can level up your characters and unlock new colors for each few levelsso there is some degree of progression and playing a lot of one character can feel slightly rewarding It also helps that a potato could likely run this gamethat’s just about all the positivity I have to share As someone who has played and seen this game played at a very high level for many hoursI can confidently say that Brawlhalla is a fundamentally flawed mess Im not going to complain about the toxic communityor the netcodeor matchmakingor any of the stuff you see other reviews complaining about Im only going to talk about the games core mechanics and why it fails competitivelyand if you are running you can dodge twice in succession When the iframes from the dodge endyou are able to jump or attack almost immediatelywhich is one of the main reasons why it’s so ridiculously safe You can also jump in any direction 3 timesand once youre in the air you can quickly fall to the ground to get all your jumps back and continue hopping around This combination of instant invincibility on a 1 second cooldown and an insane amount of aerial freedom results in a passivefloaty meta where playing optimally means avoiding making any approaches Usuallymaking the first attack means risking being punishedwhereas dodging or floating away is safe and can potentially put you in a position to punish a whiffed attack Because of thisit often feels like you’re chasing your opponent rather than fighting them Seriouslyplaying this game feels like youre in space with how effortlessly you can float around and avoid your opponent Constantly approaching will get you killed faster than a lone cripple in a collapsingburning building Sometimessalty players will run away from you in ranked just to troll you and you will have a very hard time catching them Yesthis is a problem with the communitybut it shouldn’t be possible in the first place A key reason this happens is because dodging is a stupidly easy way to escape pressure Any time you get hit you can just dodge in one of eight directions and reset the match to the neutral phase Brawlhalla’s neutral phase is reminiscent of two kids hopping around on a jungle gym endlessly until one kid falls and hurts themselves in this casehurting yourself would be equivalent to approachingbut its rather forgiving and you only need to touch the stage for a few frames before you can resume wall camping Once you get comfortable with movement in this gameit’s incredibly easy to dance around on the wall for as long as you wantyou might be thinking that all the problems I’ve listed thus far could be addressed by nerfing dodge in some capacity Unfortunatelythe entirety of Brawlhalla has already been crafted and balanced around this awful mechanic Certain weapons are better at punishing dodges than otherswith some weapons capable of dealing massive damage on a precise dodge read A considerable dodge nerf would mean that these weapons would benefit immensely and quickly become meta The only way I can imagine this game’s passivity problem being fixed would be a colossal rework of dodgingjumpingand probably every weapon in the game as well Understandablythe developers don’t know what that rework should be and how to conduct it They’re trying to fix the game’s passive float meta by applying band aid fixes that ultimately do very little to address the hugeoverarching passivity problem Brawlhalla has always hadI told myself I was going to play ranked with the only intention being to winwhich meant playing fully passive and not caring what people thought of me I quickly reached top 50 in the world doing this Almost nobody gged me and plenty of people complained about my playstyle in post game chat Admittedlyalthough I am never toxic to anyone regardless of how they playI dont blame a single one of those people for their anger Brawlhallawhen played at a high levelis legitimately one of the most frustrating fighting games to play in existence Just imagine losing to someone after they avoided approaching youwall campedor outright ran away from you for the entire game Considering thisit’s no wonder why Brawlhalla’s community is a cesspool of toxicity and noxioussalty fumesI cannot justifiably do so Most people who play this game will stay at a basiccasual level and never even notice or be forced to encounter the serious passivity problem this game has Sodespite my frustration with BrawlhallaI am giving it a positive review My recommendation would be to play with your friends and avoid taking this game too seriously Howeverthe prevalence of the passive float meta is noticeable as early as high platinumlow diamondso be very forewarned and prepared to deal with it if you intend to play this game for many hoursman like smashIts one of those games where youll sayI hate this gameand then immediately hop into another matchThrowing the gun gives you more range than actually firing itIts one of those games where youll sayI hate this gameand then immediately hop into another matchnonvisible form of self harmIts one of those games where youll sayI hate this gameand then immediately hop into another matchMakes you angryi wanna punch myself every time i play this gameThe amount of time Ive spent in this game would be surprising considering the score Im giving itbut I cannot seriously recommend Brawlhalla when there are so many better ways to use your time Theres NO community in any online game Ive faced not even other F2P games such as LoL that is as toxic as this one is If you dont live close to one of the servers for this game your connection is jsut utter garbage Youre always gona have some sort of input lag If youve ever played any fighting game youll realize this game is very unbalanced and devs just cycle through metas to hype the tournaments up basically as they know exactly what theyre doing and its not balance Theres no penalty for doing or not doing stuff here NO Rock Paper Scissors type of design you find in literally EVERY OTHER FIGHTING GAME The whole economy behind this game revolves around being an assholetaunts are the best selling inapp purchase by a mile If you dont live in the US or one of the 1st world countries then good luck trying to buy anything as the premium ingame currency price isnt region adjusted The more you play and the farther you get up to Diamond the more passive and boring the game becomes Theres footsiestheres defensive oriented characters in other fighting games but this is ridiculous some matches will be stalemates where your opponent will literally just run away As a matter of a factrunning away is objectively more effective than anythign else which is an incentive to play passively Why Because you have more options to run awaydodgedefendthrow your weaponetc than you have to approach Why would I recommend a game whose population is mostly kids yet it has the most toxic players ever Everyone is tired ofthe toxicityof the passiveness and the overall sameness of the game You dont have to believe me if you dont want tofew people really talk about this but it is the truth You can check toxicity Brawlhalla on Youtubeyet it lacks any balance to it The fact they dont do anything about it yet they pour a new skin or toxic taunt every other month tells you what the developers priorities are its a business after all Toxicity is a moneymaker Even Brawlhallas top players complain about the things mentioned and even moreyet in years those complaints have not been adressed at all Boomie 12 player depending on the year has complained about a lot of stuff throughout the yearsSandstorm undeniably 1 focuses on playing Smash competitively yet he absolutely DESTROYS this sceneeggsoup extop 8 regular constantly points out the problems with the community and the metadopameme one of the guys who made the best exhibition combo videos has complained and left the competitive scene due to several instances of lacking balance These are people that have thousands of hours poured in the game and they all agree with thisnot gonna liebut I do not recommend it when you have to face an absurd amount of toxicity if youre a casual and an insanely passive and unbalanced meta if youre playing competitivelyRules of Brawlhallabut still losedoesnt rank upderanksthis game is actual painranked is very fun if you hate yourselfI have played this game to deathand I love and I hate itthere isnt a game on steam I could recommend to you moreparticipating in tournaments and attending LAN events During this time the game has seen its upsand its downs Ultimatelydue to its amateur but dedicated and communicative dev team BMGit has come out on topand the competitiveoh man The competitive community is freshyoung and enthusiastic Its everything someone looking to get into competitive gaming  selfimprovement could wantbut has a well rounded set of fighting game dynamicsbut it plays very cleanly with some of the best netcode Ive EVER SEENas well as supporting a huge variety of characters and weaponsbut there is more room for you as an individual to make an impact It is NOT EVEN CLOSE to too late to get into the gamethe community that gathers at our offline events is one of the besthands down Ive had some of my best experiences IN MY LIFE at these eventsthere is no reason not to at least TRY this game If youre a competitive person but havent found the right game for youhop on the ranked ladder and if it doesnt get your blood boilingdoesnt do it for youwell it was free anywayin case you didnt knowthe world championship is on November 3rdand has a 100000 prize pool Good game if you want to have mental breakdown and literal cancerI play this game just to get thrown  and juggled aroundfeeling the sheer helplessness and lossHeard about this game from a friend Tried it out 1000 hours laterI still LOVE it AGood game if you want to have mental breakdown and literal cancerI got a lot of positive emotions from the game only after I removed it from my pcDevs refuse to fix the broken metathey consistently buff characters that dont need buffingand nerf others that have been getting nerfs for 3 years now Some characters havent had a buff since Beta and now because of the 34 odd characters and new weapon typestheres a massive skew to 23 specific weapon types that they wont fix Devs dont read their own Steam discussion with countless threads from players complaining and noting specific things wrong with the game Very frequent lag and desync issues the devs always blame on your ISP or your router rather than their shitty servers45 times in a row despite there being thousands of people playing in any specific ranking bracketbut its so fucking broken and full of bullshit toxic players that I cant play this game anymore without getting angry at itthis has been my TEDtalk
1,There are no videos in this FIFA  page at the time Im writing this reviewbecause those new technologies that EA advertised in YouTube videos urlhttpsyoutubeo1igaMv46SY Hypermotionetc url are ONLY AVAILABLE IN NEXTGEN CONSOLESnot in PC Basically if those videos were in this pageit would be false advertising and you could apply for a refund even after 100hs Thats why they need to make new vids different from the ones they have in YTbut also dont trust the blissful ignorance of those guys giving the game a thumbs up We PC players are being charged the same money as console playersbut were getting a watered down oldgen version of FIFA FIFA 019 with minor changeslike CR7 in Manchester Unitedetc Just look at the the recommended specs and file size of FIFA they are the same specs as the last 3 FIFAs from past years requires 50GB39GB after downloadi5 recommended  8gb of ram This is not the first time it happenssame thing happened last year with FIFA 1in PC they launched the game missing featuresso it might happen again in FIFA 3mark my wordsthey said  I quote urlhttpswwwpcgamercomeadoesntwanttoexcludesomeoffifaspcplayerssoitsexcludingallofthem we dont want people with lowspec PCs missing the ability to play FIFA  url They also said that they werent interested in adding those missing features in a future patchbut if you still want more reasonsso you wont be able to invite your friends  play remotelyinstead each one of you will have to pay 60 Game publishers in Steam have the ability to enable or disable this featureso whyd you buy it now if you can just get it for 1 in 6 months monthlythis means it will take a lot of time to find online matches after some monthsso prepare for high ping depending on your regionthankfully they reverted it after A LOT OF backlash from their usersthey said it was an error from Steamso the gameplay doesnt reward great crossespassesetc Just shoot from a far distance  youll score If youre too close you wontthen FIFA  launches a sort of minilauncher in which youll have to click Play againotherwise the game wont start Doesnt bother me but it makes me think Why is it published in Steamif well end up using Origin Does people just accept these things after throwing 60 for a copypasted game that will be purposely outdated after a yearFIFA 0and other games like Back 4 bloodetc for a whole month but also access to a 10 hour trial of FIFA  as soon as you bought itplus access to the full game in April 0 But if you REALLY want to play FIFA  so badlyjust get EA Play PRO for a single month15it gives you UNLIMITED access to FIFA  for a whole month  also unlimited access to BATTLEFIELD 04plus early access Just dont spend 60 in this game at allrather buy EA Play Pro for 1 month to try things outThe autoloss after alttabbing to check Discord or skip to next song on Spotify might be the most hamfistedfrustrating feature Ive seen in an online game1 minute silence for the people who bought for full priceEA is being disgusting by releasing the same game for the same price blacking core featuresb that consoles have and being completely shameless of doing so If u compare the actual gameplay to the next gen u can see clear differences even main menu looks basic and ugly on pc compared to consoles I didnt expect that they would ever do such a thing sadly so i wasted my money on this piece of shit but hopefully u wont bDont support EAb and this copypasted gambling simulator we have been seeing since fifa 15Okayso I am just going to use this as a platform to go off on a tangent regarding EA and not actually review the game because it is the same damn game every year any ways itself EA You are an utter disgrace of a company and I wish you nothing but the worst The way you have treated FIFA fans on PC is beyond unforgivable You treat us like second class consumers Like we are not validyet you are more than happy to take our money every single year And you KNOW you will get our money every year because no matter how much we hate youyou have monopoly on the football genre  PES died completely with eFootball  and at the end of the dayour love and passion for the beautiful game of football is what makes us buy your crp product every year There is NO excuse for us PC gamers to not have nextgen technology We have far superior hardware than any console  YOU GAVE NEXTGEN TO GOOGLE STADIA  out there and we are more than capable of running the game just fine your argument of But we found that most FIFA players on PC do not have good enough PCs to run nextgen is completely void because the beauty of PC is that you have options Give us the option to choose If you have a good enough PCthere is no reason you should not be able to go into the settings and completely max out the graphics with nextgen technology This argument  excuse rather  is nothing but a lazy cover up AlsoI just want to add the fact that you charge as much as you do for this game and you can not even introduce Brentfords stadium to the game is nothing short of a disgrace and an embarrassment You did the exact same thing last year with Leeds when they got promoted Prior to thatyou would always add the stadium of the team that got promoted to the Premier League Now you do not even do that You make billions every single year exploiting football fans and our love for the sport Have some shameyour launch on Steam has been atrocious just like last time People are paying over 80 dollars or more in local currency for Ultimate Edition and they were not able to play the game until today You are radio silentyou offer no helpyou offer no support and you simply do not care about us Shame on youEA Shame on youIts actually insane that the PC version isnt like the next gen consoles Pretty sure my PC is the equivalent of like 3 Series XPS5 I just wanted to play the new story mode and see my boi David on the opening scene but like the HyperMotionIts not on PCctrl c  ctrl vDO NOT BUY FIFA POINTSAnother moneygrab by EA ultimate team game Only playing it with my friends and nothing else Pro clubs are also funwith friends ofcwhy does PC version gets the PS4 version Does EA think PC graphics are worse than PS5 Who the hell knowsprosI swear they deliberately make career mode trash so you play FUT There are far too many times the ball goes where you do not want it to I gave it more than 50 hours and I am done 310you can sell peopleCareer Mode  FUTThis game is literally just a yearly subscriptionSame game as last year with new rostersas I expected Even has some of the same bugs that have been in the game for a couple of years You are better off sticking with previous versions if you have themthey need to add Dragons Also the kit you choose as the away one is used as a home kitthis is not a good way to solve that issuewtf I had a 9097 potential player Poof hes gonespeed is better in the gameseems like fast players actually matter againSame Game better grassdont buy packs for the love of allahI love kicking ballsBuy FIFA 1 its the same game on PC cause EA decided not to give PC the next gen treatment Youll be saying to yourself while you play why did it pass it to the wrong guy What is my keeper doing Where is my defense cause the AI is so bad that the AI from FIFA 1 is better than this game This will be the last FIFA i buy EA doesnt care about quality they only want your money And me being a person that doesnt spend a dime on microtransactions i expect to lose a lot of game from people that spend thousands of dollars on FIFA points to get the best team possibleWooo FIFA 
1,Start campaignIve been stuck at home due to cancerin constant pain 24 hours a day for the past  years I can honestly sayit only became bearable when Total War Warhammer came out Thanks to both this and the previous gameIve managed to put up with it
1,Keep in mind that I have played Smite for 4 years nowthese Steam hours are merely 15 of my whole playtimeand while I dont regret any of those purchasesI really cant recommend this game in this state Smite is not the problemits a good game HiRez is the issuecashgrabs and rigged systemscancerous matchmakingunbalanced and clearly developerfavored charactersbugs aplentyone completely incapable and utterly useless CEO that holds back the whole department and one of the most toxic communities that even rivals Overwatchs communitySmite is your gameSmite was still in open beta and probably my favorite game for years It was diverseset itself apart from all other MOBAS through its 3rd person perspective and tons of different maps It also had that great concept where you could just buy a skin that you wanted But then HiRez published its first chests There were only  exclusive skinsbut they quickly realized how much money they could make off that garbage system In the following years95 of all new skins were exclusive or limited  put in cashgrab events or chests There was a time where there wasnt a single directly purchasable skin for 6 or more months To this day there are still gods with well over 5 skinsall of them exclusiveso about 30€ to 640€ respectivelybper rollb As a new playeryou have 055 items from the Curiosity Chest Each roll costs 30€ The chests are also riggednot joking herewhich means youll get the skin at 5355which puts you at a staggering 170€ just to get that one skin you wantedthe grande finale of cash grabsthe so called odyssey Smite teases one Tier5 skina skin that changes basically everything a god has to offer in terms of design Its comparable to LoLs ultimate skinswhich cost about 0€ The only issue here isthat you cant directly buy the skin You bhave tob get a ton of other exclusive skins you probably dont even want for that one T5 skin thats barely worth 0 bucks Youll lose about 100€if not morein this great odysseyas HiRez likes to title it The odyssey is also often accompanied by several adventures Adventures are basically one sort of RPG where you choose one god and kill some monsters The catch isthis map doesnt changethe map always remains the sameand all rewards are either locked behind a paywall who would have guessed or a tedious grindfest thatll probably take millions of your brain cells and about  weeks of your life Im not even going to talk about the recent adventurebecause thats just a pure jokebugs Smite suffers from so many bugsmany of which are present since closed beta Some of the more recent ones are so gamebreaking its honestly a joke that theyre not fixed yet First offIn 99 of all matcheslobby chat just doesnt work It wont even appear in your chat box You cant communicate with your teammates while you pick your godsalso in 99 of all matchesone or more gods wont load in your stats screen Which basically meansthatif you press TABit wont list that particular god You cant see their items which in turn means you dont know how to build against themyou cant see their relicsnot even their score Their kills b arent even listed for your teamb You basically have a ghostsometimes your game just freezes on defeat or win screen and just crashes alltogether Present since betatheyre just addressing itafter 4 yearsI just want to point out HiRez favoritismregarding both gods and modes As you would expect with godsthere are just certain gods which are blatantly overpowered or just unfun to play against These can usually be identified by looking at their skinsbecause they usually have billions Examples would be LokiNeithHercules or Nox These are not necessarily overpoweredbut have heavily bloated kits which make them almost unkillable and totally unfun to play againstSmite has a multitude of gamemodesmany more than HotsLoL or DotA Nowthe issue isthe whole game is balanced around the main modeConquest the typical 5v5 towerandminionpush modewhich every moba has In my 4 years of SmiteI have played 18 matches of Conquest To compareIve played over 000 matches of Arena 5v5 without towers600 in Joust 3v3500 in Siege 4v4 and 900 matches of Clash 5v5 mix between Conquest and Arena I never really found the ambition to learn all 4851 rules of Conquestso I stuck to the other gamemodes which barely required  of my 5 braincells HiRez just tries to force Conquest down your throat at every single possible moment IIRCone of the designleaders even talked about removing other modes so people would flock to Conquest This alone truly catches the sheer incompetence of HiRezs executives Most players even stated they would quit before theyd even touch ConquestSmites community Im more of a casual and average playerbut every single match youre plagued by atleast one incredibly inept most of the time theyre low level because matchmaking sucks or toxic playersometimes even both The problem isthat just like in many other gamesmost players think way too highly of themselves But Smite players take the cake They not only play godsthey ithink they are godsi The ultimate pinacle of garbage this game has to offer can be found on reddit You cant criticize one single god without some white knight showing up and defending their true love like theres no tomorrowbecause muh waifu Its one of the most toxic communites youll ever see in any videogameso rev up these mute buttons Just be aware that you cant mute incompetence Alsothe matchmaking is so fucking bad that I have a legit 85 winrate this season Every game balances the winrate around 50Im fascinated that both HiRez and Smite are still alive HiRez ran so many good games into the groundgunned them down in the streets or left them to rot in their buginfested basementits a miracle that the company isnt bankrupt Play this game if you wantbut youll be disappointed in the long runwhich is the worst kind of disappointment Many years Ive defended both HiRez and Smitebut at this stateit doesnt make any sense to Ive had my funI dont regret a single penny or minute Ive spentbut Im about doneThe MOBA for people who dont like MOBAsFree to playwithout constantly being bugged with microtransactions Overall it is a solid gameand with the number of gods it takes quite a bit of time to really learn how their abilities can work together I would consider this game relatively easy to pick up and play but it will take you some time to really master the finer details Give it a shotits free and if you happen to hate it you can just delete iti play this everyday but i hate itFun MOBAuninstalled and run directly through hirez client which makes it work better No idea if it is steams fault or my hardwarelots of game updates since thenoverall experience hasnt changed much although the community has definitely become slightly more than moderately toxicA game that is absolutely in the deathgrip of a bad decision driven company  This game is no longer about the love and passion that was felt years ago  The steady decisions to ignore or just flat out be incompetent at addressing the communities complaints are the only real constant hereto be honest Ohand a constant influx of new bugs while old ones remain and even evolve in annoyanceAthenas release  As a referencethis is about midway through beta  Ive got 440H and 55Mso almost about 700 hours additional to the numbers shown here in Steam  It seems like every hour I play these days is just enjoyed less and less  During betaand early season 1  there was a really heartfelt development aura that you could feel with every patch  The gods that came out were much more enjoyable than almost everything thats come out during the past year or soI will admitI do love Cerberus  But when you compare gods like ChernobogAchillesHachimanand Thoth to gods like TyrAh Muzen CabJanusand Scyllayou can just tell there really isnt much actualy originality being dumped into these kits  They may have one mechanic that is new and excitingbut other than thatits just a better version of a previous gods ability and a boring passive slapped onto it to make it feel like its actually fresh  It isntthey were all right  There was a chest with approx 55 items in itincluding voice packshigher tier skins  It was pretty cool  Also included was the new Nuclear Ymir skin and Derpules skin  Neither of these skins were really that out there as far as the original appearancebut they had nice little gimmicks  Derpules took the joke of the community hating new hercules models tiny head and took it furthergiving him a pea sized head and a funny helium voice pack  Nuclear ymir was also just a bright green version of ymir with a fun and unique voice pack and some pretty impressive effects added on  These two skins were not exactly incrediblebut they were fun and acquirable if you had already invested into much of the much smaller cosmetic inventory  Nowevery single patch that comes outthere is a new chest Sometimes even threeslapped full of random older skins and all kinds of miscelleaneous cosmetic bullshit that shouldnt be in the game either  I believe it was something along the lines of 8 months before an actual Direct purchase skin was released  Everything was a gamble  And that is bullshit  Many of the skins are now just unoriginal theme crapquitor fired  Nearly every member of this employee pool was a well knownwell liked asset of the community  Now the company is flooded with all of these people that dont seem to even really give a shit about engaging in the community  SNK8Four is my prime example  This man was absolutely adored by the communitythe pro sceneand pretty much anyone that began watching smite on twitch in its early days  He was very much the face for many people that began early  Then just one dayhes gone  To be fairHiRez no longer deserves him  So these decisions are just weird from an outside perspective  The new character design lead is just full of shitthe new artwork  effect guy HiRezChuck or some shit is just a flat disppointment with everythingWE NEED MORE ANIME AND SKULLS GUYS Its really just confusing to see this massive sweeping directional change that the game has hadespecially considering HiRez floundered their partnership with Tencent which included remodeling and removing pretty much everything in the game with skullsand now they are just fucking everywhere  Its edgy and annoyingand should rightfully be added  I guess Im just too numb to it at this point to have thought it up while typing  The matchmaking in this gameis terrible  Absolutely terrible  The queues are diluted because there are so manywith 4v4 and an objective boss in the middle to facilitate pushing  Intended to be a somewhat shorter mini conquestminimal wave farming  Its pretty much just the chance to beat the snot out of each other  This is the game that is ranked as the most popularhowever its 5v5 still with far less focus on jungleas the lanes are closer together  Pretty much arena with a little bit more farming and a center objective bosssmall side jungles and an objective boss in the middle portion  Also a more popular game mode than Conquestso now you only sit for 3mins at a time for casual conquest  Matchmaking still seems pretty random skill wisein my opinion  I get the skins in chests thing  I get the god design thing  I get the businessemployee thing  But when your game is about beating the crap out of each otheris it not an all around better idea to focus on improving that aspect  New gods are horribly bloatedevery ability becoming a novel to read as opposed to the long forgotten This ability will hurt people in front of you mechanic  Old gods are left to rotunless Hirez has decided to do massive sweeping changes to an entire kitbuffing three separate things about them and then wondering why they are overtunedof which they will then follow with sweeping nerfs that do not address the new problems and simply deteriorate a god to uselessness once more  OP Gods sit at that stage for a much longer period of time than you would expect  Conveniently when the oddyssey skin for Ullr came outBuy all the items throughout a time period  approx 140USDUllr managed to sit at 100 PB rate for Months  MONTHS  Tiny little nerfs came in to give the appearance of adjustmentbut it was incredibly shallow and obvious  3 months after the skin came out and was no longer acquirablehe was hit with multiple nerfsbringing him in line When a new god is releasedthere are two possible scenariosrequires no assistanceand will absolutely make everyone else have 0 funif the person playing them took the 10 mins it usually take to figure out the core mechanics of this godLooking at you Chernobogand I do not want to even KNOW how much money I have actually spent on it over the yearsincluding a 1500 to the world championships in January of 015  EDIT  I forgot I also attended in 016it is also a huge regret and a downward slope  HiRez needs to get their shit togetherbecause this game could easily be so incrediblebut they refuse to take the proper stepsThis game is like my wife Im apparently never good enough despite my accomplishments I keep getting yelled at and insulted but I keep coming back I honestly dont know whyPlayed the game 1900 hoursThen stopped playing because life stuff happened and tried to relog after 3 years of not playing Smite and my account is banned for no reason I started playing when Scylla came out I believe and had to stop when Hachiman or Artio came outI even had odyssey Archon Thanatos and other T5 skins on my account only to find out that all that time and money invested on this game is gone foreveralso a lot of smurfs in early games and meta slaves everywhere in casual I would suggest that your dont spend money on this game like I did because one day your account might get banned for no reason and support wont help you at allSMITE is a fantastic game that takes the MOBA genre into a 3rdperson perspective allowing me to implement the aimingtiming and skills Ive gained from playing other gameslike shootersbut with a stronger emphasis on strategy and team building making the combat fast and highly addictiveit relies less on builds and the minionscreepsbut without removing those elements of strategy either Rather than losing an integral part of what makes other MOBAs enjoyable and meatyit replaces them with what gives games like firstperson and thirdperson shooters depth It panders to and compliments a different stylegiving a different experience but in a familiar formatbut it feels right Youre playing the role of a godand by the time youre at endgameyou have bigger threats to worry about other gods Its satisfying to build a tank that 5 enemy gods and a towerall at oncecant easily kill It feels great to have your team expect you to clutchbut succumb to the pressure and miss all your shots I love saving a teammate at the last possible moment by landing a perfectly aimed and timed kiss from Aphroditewhich stun locks the enemyweaving in and out of battleaim and speed Team fights are intense and replicate the rush youd expect from a competitive shooterall while respecting the governing outline of a MOBA That makes SMITE a truly unique experienceplay LoL or Dota They see other games within the same genre as direct competition to the game they love They dont care about enjoying games for what they offer they compare and contrast simply to feel like they’re part of a team—for the sake of ego It’s as though they themselves had a hand in the game development theyre veryvery proudit substitutes with a skillorientedhigh speed combat experience It has depth and develops a skillset absent from other MOBAs So it comes down to misunderstanding the skills necessary in SMITEperhaps more I wish my friends would play with mebut most of them have standards and strongly draw the line after LoL They’re better than Smiteand If I want to play with themI’m going to have to play their favorite MOBAbut even without a single friendthis game has kept my attention and Ill continue to play itSMITE is constantly evolving New skinsnew godsnew mapsredesignsnew itemsnerfsbuffsnew UIetc In the short amount of time Ive played the gameIve seen many drastic changes If you tried Smite years agoit’s a promise that this SMITE is a completely different game today by this time next yearitll have drastically changed again All these changes are enhancements and true refinements to the game It continues to get better and betterand HiRez listens to the playersDota and Heroes of The Storm as wellSmites unique camera angle alone is enough to set it apart from other MOBAsand developer HiRez didnt stop there Each map is polishedevery God looks and sounds greatand exceptional Match of the Day modes offer plenty of variety Some lategame balance issues asideSmite’s divine execution of innovative ideas make it a worthy contenderI hate myselfThe MOBA for people who dont like MOBAsThe more gods that come out the more hentai you can find onlineRISE AND FALL OF SMITEbut nothing that really bothered me We had HeBroLil ManaOlympian Anhurbut I felt like these skins were not seen too often They did not

where Cernunnos and many others were running rampant with insane damage and mobilityI still have 88 win rate with Cern and 86 with the Bee Then there was the Defence metawhere assassins and warriors built 4 bridge itemsand were able to destroy mages and hunters with easewhile taking barely any damage Hirez did struggle massively to balance the gameand as they added more and more Gods and Itemsit was even tougher job to get things right Weve all seen how bad it eventually gotwe saw where the manpower has gone Skins The base mechanics are barely workingwhile leaving people often with issues likeforcing you to restart the gamebut they did horrible job with managing the game There are few expectationsbut most of these skins are not appealing They are all copies of each other with the same Edgy RobotSchool GirlStuffed AnimalEdgy Demon and Edgy Demon Hunter Knight Thing kind of themes They have been using the same taunts and cringey popculture references for yearswith the same god damn

Every time the game crashesit bans you for what seems like a completely random amount of time For exampleI have been banned for 4 hours30 hours10 hours30 minutes10 minutesetc No response from the development team whatsoeverthe community is absolute trash Every single person is toxic and no one ever wants to help As of July 00the game has been taken over by trollsthe developers are just as bad Several people in the community who have made smite as popular as it is constantly get abused by the dev team Even casual players can fall victim to this as wellall they have to do is mass report you

on ps4 this is what you need to know before buying the gameit takes time to learn about the gods every god has specific builds and mechanicstell them you are new to the game and they will understandits a smaller conquest against 3v3 but it has some mechanics as conquestI think its about time I finally review this gamewhich was over  years ago I remember that I was a HUGE fan of the old Sun Wukong Hun Batz nowadays and enjoyed the gamealthough I never got hooked into it I eventually just stopped playing and went to get addicted to other gamesnamely Team Fortress  Fast foward to 015where SMITE is finally released on Steam I was very curious to give this another tryso I did Nowbefore I continueI have something to say All of my good friends know this fact welland I HEAVILY emphasize thisbut I just never liked thembesides Awesomenauts I downloaded SMITE and gave it a second chancefiguring it might be pretty cool now Okaythis is the part where you look at the number of hours I have in the game Just take a nicesolid look at it To the reviewbut at the same time it actually looks really nice in some placeslike Siege and Conquest Not much to say herebut this is not a game for the photographers out there like myselfIs SMITE a good enough MOBA to compare with LoL and DOTA The answer to that question iswellyes I find it much better to BE the character your playing asrather than telling them what to do Its what makes SMITE stand out from the rest of the crowdand it shines brightly in this way I dont want to start a flame warbut although it is very simple to understandthe game is much more difficult to master because of the fact you have to actually LAND your shots No more clickyclicky heres the part where 3 champions die or whatever Your abilities matterand missing one could change the course of a game Plusof courseteamwork is important in Conquestand I havent actually encountered many OP godsif any at all Some items are clearly better than others cough bluestone pendant cough cough but most arent too severe OverallSMITE delivers with the gameplay by milesthere is no known story This will not be counted towards the final scorebut the some of the voice packs you can purchase for gods are actually really funny Some of the writing is extremely clever and gives the game a LOT of personalitythis game is much easier to pick up and playalthough still being a very competitive game The communityalthough not sunshine and rainbowsis much easier to deal with and far friendlier than those other toxic wastes of communities The gameplayas said earlieris simple and it doesnt require too much experience to understandhowever I would recommend staying away from Conquest in that case There are also daily rewardsbut I dont like the fact that the prizes dont get increasingly better after 7 daysbecause it doesnt feel right getting 75 Favor for playing 8 days of SMITE Invest the timehoweverand itll greatly pay off Trust me on thatSMITE gives me a much better point of view on MOBAsmy least favorite genre of gaming I can easily recommend this game if you dont want to go through a brutal experience like DOTA and LoLand the fact that it brings out its differences with pride makes it one of the most enjoyable and addictive games Ive played since Team Fortress truly hard to masterAmazing game

1, Updates at bottom I looked at the titlelooked at the screenshots and groaned Not another zombicide game trying to say its a survival game But he got it for meand it woud be rude to not atleast give it another shot Im rather glad I didset to the medium difficulty Day one was a messI figured I was playing another left4dead survival game which was all about killing as many zombies as one humanly can before wandering to the next area Wellafter breaking a few weapons on zombies and getting no reward outside of what lint was in the zombies pocketsI knew I was wrongand night had begun to set in My friend luckily had played before and warned me that things got a lot different at nightso we managed to make it through with no deathsbut many close callsIm more than hooked Survival is the key Foodwaterscavvingrepairs and building at day Sheltersecurity and stealth at night Crafting damn near anything in a Alpha gamefrom multiple layers of cobblestone walls outside of what used to be a log cabin Each peice taken the long crafting process of finding rockschopping them down into stone and then turning into cobblestone More We built a second story for storing items More Two layers of spiked pits surrounding our cabin with only a bitch for us living people to cross More Another storyturned into a rooftop farm of cornblueberries and potatoswe try to keep quiet throughout the nightslimiting player activity to things that dont make soundor carry foods on our person that generate smell  Yesthats a thing A chest near the front door full of easy repaired and built weapons Pistolsa shotgun and some ammo for itfresh from the forge when things get really bad The newly crafted fallback pointa basementbunker Metal wallsfloorand roofonly one entry which is blocked in times of emergencies Bedsemergency food and water or tea supplies stored next to some of our most powerful weapons  Chainsawslandminesa rocket launcherand a whole lot of shotgun ammo it has a few minor bugsbut its in alphaand they generally get fixed up rather swiftly Worth the moneygreat with friends Especially when you notch up the difficulty and find yourself hiding for your life in a closet with nothing but a stick to protect yourselfand fun as is214 Update 1but it has been brought to my attention that a good amount of people have read this So I thought I owe it an update due to the manymany changes to the gamethough soso much more crisp now than it was before A lot of the bugs have been worked out Some still linger You now can upgrate tiles after you lay them into more fortified version of their previous selves A wooden frame  Wooden block  Reinforced wooden block  Metal reinforced wooden block As well as many other types of similar thingsits rather neat I thinkthough has its bugs and the occasional cluster of buildings you recognise from the old worldbut still adds a great stuff Maps now have a fog of war making it harderand more exciting to go scavangingMinecraft was too boring for me Im not a creator for creations sakeI enjoyed the additional combat focusI didnt like the lack of building at least when I played itbut it got stale as there was no forced conflict No reason to exploreno reason to keep building So it fell into the minecraft trapbut gives me a good solid foundation of conflict and purpose to my building Not only thatbut it creatively forcesencourages me to get out of my safe keep and risk exploring which causes me to engage with the game content in a very enjoyable fashionand Ive dedicated 9 of my gaming hours to this since I bought it over the holiday break Strongly recommendI play with my son and 2 grandsonsit keeps this grandmother up late at night on the weekends Who says an Ol lady doesnt have anything in common with the younger people I love itim 65 and been playing games since the early 8si have around 15 hrs gameplay in 7 days to die game and must say that this game is on the same fun level as half life when that wonderfull game first arrived everything in the world is destroyable and everything is useableeverything that lives in the world is killable and can kill you i will be playing this game till the day i die both single player and with my friends it is slow in moving forward to a full release game but the money has to come from somewhere and funpimps are not a huge companyimagine this game if funpimps were as big as bethesda or the other big game companies the fact that this game is so playable even in its unfinished state should tell you all you need to know keep hard at it funpimps its a yes from me and your through to the finalsOne of my favorite games that I have played in the past five years has got to be 7 Days to Diehands downmaybe even my absolute favoriteI dont play it for three or four hours before rating ityoure barely into a game to even rate itin my opinion At this momentIm 529 hours inso I felt the time to review it was approaching fastso here I amI had been scrolling around on YouTubelooking for games to watch people playwhen I accidentaly stubled upon this gem I only saw Alpha 1 gameplay at the timewhich barely resembles what this game is now Despite how it lookedI had been looking for a survival base building game for a long timeso I bought it one weekendand it absorbed my soul and then someyou have little to nothing on you You have a bottle of watera bandageand some food to start with You can loot your surroundings to get some basic materials to start making a stone axe to start getting wood to make a simple shack If you dont want to build a base in the beginningyou can claim one of the many buildings and fortify it so it works as a home until you decide what you wantwith zombies added into the mix Depending on your difficultythe zombies might be a niusance or an absolute nightmare to deal with Every 7 daysa Zombie horde will come to attack you and destroy the precious progress youve made on your basehence the name 7 Days to Die In those 7 daysyou will build your baseand get traps and weapons ready to survive the night and emerge victorious from your base when the morning comesit senses how well youre doing If youre sweeping through the zombie hordes and havent died in a whileIt will send stronger zombies in more numbers to try to give the hardcorre people a challengebut for the sake of people who get bored of reading reviews all daylet me get to my pros and consand start all over again on another world with different settings to give your veteran self a bigger challengeto keep the game fresh EDIT Even though the updates come rarelythere is SO MUCH added each update its sometimes like youre playing an entirely different gameso if you build a structure incorrectly or a zombie takes out an important support beamthe building could fall apart around youalong with your supplies being cast into the voidthere is a huge variety of serverssome being PvEPlayer verses Enemyothers being PvPPlayer verses Playerother servers being modded to give the game even more lifebut they happen at least 3 or 4 times a yearso you will be playing the same thing for at least a couple of months before anything new is addedwhich is annoying at timeswith so much to do and a horde on Day 7 being a problem that might overwhelm some players I would reccomend watching some people play this first before jumping inmainly so you have a vague idea on what you are doing After that initial curvethe game definitely gets easierthen this game might be a bit dissapointing for you The modelsespecially for the playersarent too pretty to look at The zombies are a bit betterbut like I saidthe graphics are a bit dissapointing to look at The landscape is kind of blockybut It is a minecraftlike gameso it is to be expectedthis is one of my favorite games of all time It does have its flawslike not super good graphicsa bit of a learning curvefew updatesand the occasional bugbut what it has far outclasses its conslike solid gameplaylots of repalyabilityand having building physics that make you build smart and realistic I would reccomend at least trying this game outI think that you will enjoy itThree friends and I spawn in the wasteland biomestarted turning into something permanenthidinga trench around itis just a small story that wasnt even in full detail of what 7 Days to Die is like Very few may say that Ohits just another zombie survival game or Ohits just a DayZ knockoff WellIm here to tell you that this is not the case at all I own H1Z1DayZand 7dtd I have to say that this is the best one Whymay take a bit to get used to Butstill awesomethere are actually physics to the building system Likein some casesyou actually have to put support Otherwise that sniper tower or that neat house will collapse on you Which has happened to my friends Its kind of satisfying to watchbut damn youre mad if its your structureyou have beesdogsand zombies and other different kind of zombies to add to thatIm goodbecause they actually threaten you The fact that they sprint at night by default settings can be changed also adds a thrill to the game To a point in which you dont even want to leave your shelter at night because you can hear a spider zombie calling a nearby horde Hordes also happen randomly at anytime and anywhere This is also unheard of in DayZ You never see a horde in that game Alsoas the days go onthe zombies start to get a little tougher You start to feel that the apocalypse is worsening Zombies are also smartdont think that just putting a wall around your base will help Zombies will rip through it and actually dig under the wall Weve seen this done in our server beforeand its frustratingbut its so awesome having to constantly keep maintanence on your base and look for new ways to prevent them and to see your weak spotsand you wanna know the awesome thing This right hereis just an alpha A fucking Alphaand the developers have already come this far As I type thisthe alpha11 update is imminent and should be released any day now This is said to be the biggest update this game has seen This game is going nowhere but upI cant tell you about the PvPbecause my friends and I just normally play on a private PvE server and survive together I have no idea how well PvP works If I ever play PvPIll tell you how it goesFirst time playing when it turned night I had no choice but to burry myself in the dirt themMy first foray into 7 Days to Die went like thisthen proceeded to accept a quest from her to gather supplies from a location about a kilometer and a half awaya broken arm and legand an infectionbut they still took some time to heal and the infection wasnt going anywhere I retreated to the trader but she had no antibiotics for sale which meant I was on my own for the infecitoncoming across an abandoned hospital Reasoning that I could likely find medical supplies yet to be plundered or spoiled inside I girded myself and broke infighting my way through several floors worth of the undeadduring a quick outdoor run through a small open air garden to get around a barricaded part of the hospital I discovered birds could be zombified as well and was promptly attacked by a flock of the rotten budgies I was able to fight them offbut this upgraded my infection to serious and gave me a fresh laceration Thankfully I had located bandagesI had no gun I left it lay and continued onwards to the rooftop Peering carefully over the edge I saw no less than a dozen zombies led by one that seemed much larger than the others By now my food supplies were exhaustedmy water supplies were running lowand I had no means to make a campfire to replenish either Deciding to declare bollocks to this I carefully made my way back down out of the hospitalwould get mauled to death by a zombified Yogi Bear again7 Yearsthe fact that it has sold so many and is so highly rated yet is still considered Early Access Alpha is beyond me Updates are still churning in The 193 B6 update Available to opt in as of yesterdayits time to poo or get off the pot Youre making a mockery of what a game in Early Access means As buggy as it isCyberpunk 277 released fully before you did Were up to the Playstation 5 Your game is good but you cant keep the training wheels on forever Its never going to be perfect Nothing isI was playing modded minecraft many moons agobut it was just too safe You build your house and bamyouve always got a safe space Pahnever total safety I wanted the chance of losing it all I also wanted zombiesyou can still make yourself pretty safe You can mix concrete and build a shimmering tower bristling with spikes and traps You can look out your windows and laugh at the slightly glitchy feral hordes as they stream screaming to your door beneath the blood red sky You can go about your crafty business as they claw at your walls You can feel safe But not forever Theres always a timer ticking in your mindtheyll get inbuUPDATEubI felt as though I needed to update this review to reflect on some of my experiences over the past couple of years I have picked the game up again on occasionbut didnt find myself as content to continue playing as I used to be There have been many changes over the past couple of years mostly in terms of your character having a skill and perk systemwhich is a nice addition and adds a lot of RPGfeel elements Howeverthe game suffers from something I feel a lot of survival games lack end game replayabilityas written in my original review below long before I had so many hours playedbut the fundamental problem is that once you are establishedonce you have access to creating your own munitions and have the hardware to farm resources effortlesslythe game becomes quite stale Im sure the addition of more NPCs etc in the future will amend thishaving a reason to leave your stronghold and go out into the worldbut I feel as though the developers are perhaps setting their sights a little itooi highsigh was met with a huge backlash of negativitymostly because the game needs so much work  not in terms of contentthe game has an endless amount of items and block types and there is still the potential for a massively popular RPGSurvival experience in this game The problem is that some of the core engine mechanics reallyreally need work Movement feels sketchyaiming weapons and firing them feels far from smooth and the game doesnt exactly run smoothly at high settings even with beefy hardware This was forgivable 2 years agobut for it to still be playing this way is dissapointingand Im sure I will return to itbut I would love to see the developers iron out the creases in the core game mechanics instead of having such an enormous amount of focus on adding new things Finding poop in toilets and having the ability to throw that poop is hilariousturning that poop into compost to grow crops more efficiently shows great ingenuitybut I only wish they would iron out the creases before adding to the already vast amount of itemsblockslocations etcit is a great experienceespecially with friendsbut for it to become a true blockbusterI feel the developers need to take a step back and improve on what is ialready thereidigging a hole in the side of a hill before nightfall and hiding insidestarving and hoping nothing would find meseeing sunrise has never been such a relief After some exploration and scavenging for food and waterI found a townthinking this would be a good place to lay my bed and fortify a building to try and hold off anything that came for me at nighta horde came for me and trashed my defensesthe few crossbow bolts I had managed to craft were consumed in no timeand I found myself in a backroom hacking through the roof trying to find an escape routemy friend below me yelling at me to hurry up as he desperately tried to repair the door that was being pounded on by zombies I see daylightIve found a way out Our glimmer of hope ruined when I looked down to see my friendlooking up at mewith the floor beneath him almost completely destroyed and a horde of zombies under himbarely a block left to stand on I told him not to look downbut naturally he didwhat ensued was a genuinely fearful collaboration of curse wordsdesperation wouldnt be a fitting enough word to describe itthis game has brung about a whole new meaning to the survival genrebeing in a fortified position and crafting yourself a lot of ammunition simply wont cut ityou can play rambo for a short time but your resources will eventually diminish if you use them too recklessly and you will find yourself back to being starving and hiding away once againyou really need to think about how and when youre going to engage the zombies by choicebecause when a feral horde comes for youyou wont have a choiceand you better be ready for when that happensit is also a brilliant game to play with your friends and rewards cooperative gameplay Sustaining yourselfby yourselfis indeed possiblebut with friends you can assign eachother certain tasksfor example me and a buddy built a fortified bunker with a deep mineshaft underneathhe spent most of his days underground miningcreating ammunition and suchproviding me with raw materialswhile I worked on our surface defences and food supplies Doable alone but so much more efficient if planned with a friendor a few friends is even betterunless you are the hardcore lonewolf typeI can imagine that adds whole new elements of fearfactor into the gameknowing that other survivors may just snipe you from a distance and steal your stuffat their own discretionor maybe they will help youits up to themI may build the courage to try this somedayat the moment Im happy enough just trying to survive waves of zombie hordes on a PVE serverthere is the occasional annoying glitchbug here and there as to be expected in a game at Alpha stage but I have found nothing gamebreaking as of yet To think that there is so much more to be added in terms of character customisationexperience pointsmore weaponry etc is a very exciting thought indeed I can see this game making a huge impact on releaseit is genuinely brilliant funespecially playing with friendsthe title is misleading it only took me 9 minutes to dieFirst spawnkilled by pigkilled by same pigfound blunderbuss and murdered pigOkay How to review this game As you can seeI have a lot of time into this game Im so very torn on how to review this game because my opinion of it is bittersweetto put it bluntlythe goodto dateeverything in the game has a useand the progression is decent9 hours invested in this gameover its lifetimeits a good game with lots of replay value This game has the most value of any game Ive ever ownedand honestlythat in and of itself is hugefor the badbecause as of lateIve been very very disenchanted with the developmentand methods for developing the game Mind yousome of these gripes can be adjusted with settings but franklyfrom where the game startedall the way to where its gone over the past couple of yearsthey are very much validand quite honestly worth addressing hereis that no matter what you dono matter how much you progressyou cannot ever be considered Safe Any time the community finds a way to make a base typeSafe the developers change the entire AI so that these methods no longer work The issue with this isat the end of the daythere is no point at all in progressingas the zombies rip through just about anything that youd buildin a matter of minutesand the defenses are easily dispatched and insanely underwhelming Back in the dayI used to work my butt off to get to concrete and steelso I could make a defensible base It gave me a reason to play and something to work towards And because of this gripeI can no longer play this game without getting bored after a week or soand quitting for months This is what killed the game for meoverallyou used to be able to skill up by preforming the tasks that you wanted to level This was amazingand was very much like real life This was one of the things that drew me to the game in the first place How do you get better at something Practice Now basicallyyou kill zombiesgain XP and spend points from levelups Franklyit makes no senseand this change was explained away in the most stupid way possibleand it made me lose a LOT of respect for the development of this game In factthis is whenwhy I stopped playing the game as much as I used toand was the start of my distaste for it Apparently leveling by doing isnt realistic and in order to conform to the desires of what I call the Immersion Turd communitytheyve effectively done away with one of the main things that made the game unique and overall enjoyablerewarding to playwith the introduction of vehiclesit cuts the size of the map downimmensely Finding borders and endless oceans as a border is a complete Buzzkillas the game itself isnt rewarding to a nomadic playerwhich this game eventually forces you to bethe longer you play Simply putthe mapseven randomgenis cappedand smalleven at the maximum map sizebut when you need to increase the XP gain to 3 in order to pace the game at a normal speed Theres a problemand barely worth putting herebut it is something to note TFP have seriously lofty goals with their updates This is finebut at the same timeits not Because of thisupdates can take 6 months at minimumto release Most take nearly a year Which is fine I guessas most of their major updates change the game greatly The fact of the matter isthe development has been ongoing for far too longits far too slowand franklythis is one of the many many things that are destroying the games longterm successthis one speaks for itself by this point There is NOTHING in the way of endgame Theres no reason to even get thereand by the time youre at a point where you can hold your ownyoure so beaten down and burned out from the issues listed abovethat it only leaves a bad taste in your mouth This has been the issue with this game since day oneI would completely recommend the game Obviously I got my moneys worth The game is fine I will still say that this is probably the best survival game to date Its worth buying But if the devs dont stop intentionally screwing over their communityand ignoring the need for endgame contenttheyre going to destroy one of the best games of the decade Im on the fence on whether I would recommend this game to a friendI really am But to the average playerthe game is fine For those who started playing this in the beginning Its a shadow of what it once wasand its painfully obvious that the potential that it had wasputting it mildly squandered Its for this reason why I cannot effectively say whether or not Id recommend it Try it out for yourselfits worth that much alone I originally played 7DtD for barely 3 hours when I first purchased this game because I didnt see the hype and that was a HUGE mistake seeing as I only made it to Day 2 Ill give details on that in a bit and in that time I died twice I collapsed my base and then did the same with my mining tunnels I got annoyed as I thought the game was broken and buggyI then looked at the designthe fact that gravity affects structuresthe fact that you can get coldor overheat if you work for too longthe fact that if you get an illness and dont treat it youll lose wellnessits got a sense of realism that Ive only honestly ever seen this game provideyou begin by building a basegetting some farms going for foodfinding lakes for wateryou go and raid some towns that you found whilst exploring to find the perfect spot for your baseand start making better toolsthis is the first part where you need to be careful Theres a heatmapif you make a forge or a mixer to get your base stronger youll start to generate heat based on usage and that Can draw zombiesyou need to work out if you REALLY need the forge running 247or your Campfire running to cook those extra eggs Then you look to the top of your screen and realize Its day 6 2348panic sets inyou know that in less than 18 hours youre going to have some unwanted friends because Each day you hit thats a multiple of 7 714212835Soon the horde attacksyou cant just hide in your base and crouch whilst praying they cant see youyoure hunted constantlyyou need to plan ahead and build a bunkeror get ammo together to defend yourself activelyyour base defenses hold them off for a time but they begin to shatterthe spikes you laid down begin to collapse under the sheer weight of the rottenmalodorous corpses baring down on themyour walls begin to crack as theyre relentlessly pounded on by the undead hordes that seek to make you their next mealthen a friendly jingle playsits 6AM on Day 8a smile crosses your face as you realize you survivedyou realize that once youve slaughtered this wave of undead fiends youre mostly safe for another weekyour bow thunks a final arrow into the Burned Survivor and he drops to the ground Relief washes over you as you set to work repairing and strengthening your basemy review barely scratches the surfacePLEASEgenuinely give this game a goI promise youll never regret itthe devs have also taken a lot of the heart out of the game by making it too Pointless Over the top skill treesunending lagweird glitches and bugs that seem to have reappeared from earlier stages of developmentunnecessary additions to the game that are further damaging performance and gameplay Oh and the greatest thing Ive seen so far I made a post on the forums asking about the progress towards a Performance updateor a game cleanup updateinstead of receiving any responsesI got Banned TFP What has happened to youIts one of my favorite games of all timeyet I cannot recommend it And it pains meI think that the latest updatealpha 17was a huge step in the wrong direction Instead of being a zombiesurvival game with awesome building mechanics where you could build huge and massive basesit simply became a zombiekilling grindfestwhere bases don’t matterbecause zombies chew through concrete like it was nothingdont get me started on the zombie AI It was fine in alpha 16 and the zombies acted as you would expect dumb In alpha 17the pathing of the AI is just ridiculouswhere the zombies are able to estimate the path of least resistanceas if they were not only sapientbut extremely intelligent This has led to the current base buildingmeta mazes and ramps facepalmyou could improve cardio by runningyou could improve miningefficiency bywell mining  so on so forth Nowyou just kill zombies to gain expget perk points and then spend said perk points To be fairthey have buffed exp gains from other activities recentlybut you still simply gain and spend perk points  yet another horrible downgradelet’s talk about loot In Alpha 16 you could loot items ranging from quality 1 to 6 Weapons and certain tools had components of individual quality that you could then combine to form said weapontoolthat would have the average quality level of said parts The quality would determine the damagedurability of the weapon etc This system was great and gave an incitement to go out in the world and continue to looteven if you hadsay the AK47because you could improve it vastly by finding better parts This has been replaced by a system where all weaponstools are looted whole in a quality system ranging from 1 to 6 Yes1 to 6 Minimal difference in damagedurabilitybut heyat least you can attach mods to the weapons now The amount of mods you can attach are determined by the level of the item You can now improve the damage of your rifle by painting it in another color Great…and yet againit used to be just fine in Alpha 16 Don’t bother mentioning it to the devsthey’ll just give you a douchy response about your rig being a potatoeven though you’re running with highend partsno I would not recommend the game Howeveryou can opt in for playing Alpha 16which I would recommend – if you can accept that the game might never evolve any furtherLong time player here Purchased nearly a dozen copies of the game for numerous friends and family A year or two ago I would have had great things to say about this game and the direction Nowhoweverthe story changesalpha 17 They changed nearly every aspect of the game Thats okaythings change The majority of the playerbase overwhelmingly complained on the forums Thats okaycustomers complainMadmolehonestly admits that he doesnt play the gamebut changes things he doesnt like about it He admits in videos how much hes forgotten about the game even though he allegedly is the primary programmer He then proceeds to have his forum moderators censor dissent and complaints hardcore and tells them that he doesnt care about their opinionschange is fine But saying I dont like aspect xand even though I dont play the gameand eighty five percent of the comments on the forum approve of aspect xI dont like itor didnt when I played a year agoso Im taking it out is not okay at all⁣h1Exciting mix of DayZ and Minecrafth1but regularly updatesIt took me several frustrating hours to get the hang of this btch but that was 215 and now it accounts for less than 1 of my total play time  The rest is sheer joyand maybe a little bit of ravenous addictionbut at a base price of 25 as of this review I still consider it a steal  Catch it on sale and youre getting a deal so good it can only be called unholylol and do your own math  I have probably spent a bit over 1 all toldthoughbecause I keep gifting the game to friendsand I still feel I got my moneys worth easily  While theres some roughness around the edgeseven now it IS still technically an alphathough that is easy to forget the amount of content this game offers is absolutely staggering  Beyond thatas of Alpha 193 at leasttheyve reached a place where its very balancedrelatively newcomerfriendlyand wellpacedbut also in no small part due to the nature of the game7D2D retains a glorious ability to surprise meeven after thousands of hours of play  You just never know when you might get trapped in a barn loft one night with a ravening wandering horde around that notices the campfire you made to char up that little bit of meat you got from the lone pig downstairs because youre starvingand to boil a little water because you were in danger of dehydrating  Suddenly theres a cacophony everywhere and you clutch your pathetic sharprockonastick and hunker downknowing you cant fight themnot at this point  But you put the fire out and hold very very stilland theyll eventually go awayrightrecommend this even to people who dont like zombiescraftingsurvival  But most of all I recommend it to people who do like those things but have been left cold by other entries in that bloated genre  7 Days is the

1,I am in my seventies  My son wanted me to play an open game instead of the single games I was playing before  I am inspired by the graphics of each country that I travel ineach one is different  The puzzles are complex but doable  Each cave is distinctive and some are so enclosed while others you have to walk through slimy water to get to the other side of the trail  It seems so realistic at times  The story line continues when you least expect it and you meet characters where you least expect them  Great Game  Glad I found and play itIm a 70 yr old ladyand Ive played for some time now and I love this game I will never be hardcore or even a good player But there are so many things to do in this game it is almost overwhelming Quests are very goodthe storyline is very good and last but not leastthe graphics are fabulousespecially on a retirement pay shoestring budget I recommend a much cheaper monthly fee There is ofc the DLC content you get with the Plus membership but the ideal is to have a cheaper option only for that magical bag space just for crafters Wellits just a thoughtI need that magic bag since I farm and horde like a squirrel and craft like a boss I have soon maxed out my main crafterthey know I am old and slow and they are patient with me HopefullyI will be a better team player this year I am working on itI questexplorecollect whateverdo delvespublic dungeonsworld bossesfarm and craft And I enjoy it allthe startingdate was wrongI got the game on 6 Dec 207and started to play on my Bday7 Dec 207 Otherwisecounting the hours of gameplayI must have been glued to the screenLOL I do have a life outside TamrielI promiseI have been paying this game for yearsbuilding my opinions of the game The easiest way to describe it would be Pros vs Conshard to masterit is diverse and fun enough to keep you entertainedthen become extremely profitable in the futureyou NEED to subscribe to ESO Plus but as a little sneaky proESO Plus gives all the DLC bundled with it plus crowns equaling the price paid for subscriptionthough really funhas a very steep learning curve that leaves many unsure where to startluckily PvP isnt the main focus of the gameyeah Despite a rough launch in 204ESO has improved and worked out MOST of its flaws and kinksmaking it the great and enjoyable sandbox MMO it is todayand may you meet many fine people along your journeyAn amazing game  incredible variety of different activitiesmeet great people Highly recommend ESO for more seniors to play  at 70 i find it keeps my mind activehowever it gets addictiveTLTR ESO is the best MMO Ive played so farby miles For PvE combat is greattho I havent played for long enough to get into PvP yet You can choose to grind up to cap in a single sessionif that strikes your fancy Or you could care less about leveling and still participate fully in all nonendgame PvEI can get to anywhere Ive already been in between 30 sec to a minute For me this is a very important point I detest games that fakes longviety my wasting my timeand it doesent unnaturally inconvenience the player to make me pay extra The only inconvenience in the game comes with spontaniously harvesting crafting ingrediants while questing at the same time This was an inconvenience in the Bethesdas Elder Scrolls games aswell because of inventory You can pay to unnaturally compensate for this inconvenience through an ingredientbagor I can ignore the story entirely if I just want to grind my way to the endgame content or just want to explore This also means the game is extremely accessible for anyoneif I want to pursue it as a career There are few games where I enjoy craftingbut in this one it seems okalthough not innovative by any meansplayers are considered allies for the purpose of abilitiesand game mechanics generally supports doing so It works very well for any open area Ive been toand is faster than grouping uppeople looking for a challenge will have to do a bit of searching or research where to go and who to hook up withESO doesent have the motherhaul aspect of treasurehunting that some older Elder Scrolls titles had For instancein the original Morrowind I could sneak into an ancient abandoned fortressfind a coven of vampires there so powerful they could onehit kill mesneak past themdiscover an endgame weaponsteal it and leave It was a very unique feeling when just stumbling into it while exploringand frankly zero incentive to do so anyway in any area Ive been so far Furthergetting a guild seems to be a matter of blindly accepting guildinvites from ppl spamming general chat For instance Ive found no credible channel on how to get info on guilds that may be suitable for meseek them out and ask for an invite As a noob I find getting involved in the community in ESO a frustrating choreyou just have to find it yourself Also the queing Ive done takes 3090 minutes Some times of the day Im unable to find PUGs for dungeons at all through this tooljust not very friendly either It may of course be because the Morrowind expansion was just released and all the established players are over therefor all I knowlevitate or do Khajiitlevel jumps in ESOwhere there is a scheming badguy and everything except the endfight is about thwarting his minions His minions are everywhere in ESO Tamrieland its just to much of the same This is very different from the other Elder Scrolls titleswhere the monsters of the land seemed to make up a whole ecosystem on their ownwith their own lives and events It makes the stories that follow the quests boring after 25 hoursand deteriorating rapidly at 50 hoursthey were the reason I never played WoW for more than 20 minutes In ESO they arent as bad as the ones I experienced in the other title Its normally 35 targets instead of 2030 At first it seemed that this type of quests would be fewbut it proved to be very frequent A real pityonly back then the format required some abstractions In ESO its not an abstraction anymorebut a literally really dumb storyelement While there are some straightforward story elements of the type some soldiers have been capturedgo rescue themnonsense solutions are more common Fully expect an NPC to suggest solving a problem by shooting her magic rainbowray at the moon while farting some magic sunshine But first you must go find her some rare shrooms at one locationkill 4 zombies at another locationget 3 seashellsthen kill an evil monster turtleboss Then she can find the spy whos been taken prisoner by the enemy and learn what he knows And on to the next onewhere the NPC tells me this was all my doing Im a hero Its not that its wrongits just that after a while all questgivers start to seem like a benevolent schoolteacher praising a 7year oldnot being able to play Some are able to get it working through forum adviceand others cant and refund the game as a result The ugly part is that the developers dont communicate with the players and doesent even acknowledge the problem Its been 3 years nowso it seems they just dont find the bugs worth the cost of resolving vs the number of resulting refunds and bad reviewsbut unless the story starts diversifying in the next area I fear Ill seek other content Maybe that content can keep my attentionmaybe not Regardlessthis is the best MMO Ive played despite its shortcomings The combat is quite goodand the absence of timesinks count for alot That saidIve yet to find an MMO that could hold my attention for more than a couple of monthsThis is a review from a new player aimed at new playersafter years spent on Dark SoulsDragons DogmaRocket League and others  Me and my buddies are looking for a game to play together like in the good old days Were all dads with families now and theres no way we can get back to grinding like we used to no pun intendedand everyone assures me that it very much is Might be worth a shot so me and my buddies decide to give it a tryand wont ever be The logistics of a MMO dont really allow the atmospheric beauty and complexity of a game like Skyrim It is however way deeper in lore and atmosphere than any MMO I ever playedand you can tell great care is taken into making the world of Tamriel feel alive and breathing as much as can be Every NPCs are voiced and side quests are literally everywhere Many of them feel generic after a whilebut some are actually really clever and well written The world is absolutely humongous and very variedwith there again great care paid to respecting the Elder Scrolls lore Long time ES players will appreciate the numerous references to stories and characters they already know wellothers surprise you with high levels of details Riding from city to city through woods and moorsacross deserts and sea shoresyou always feel immersed in the world as should be They also keep improving as the latest chapterSummersetis more beautiful and detailed than ever beforeas opposed to simply leveling and spamming skills like its sometimes the case in similar games Me and my buddies have progressed steadily and we find ourselves beating dungeons we never thought we could beat beforeand not just because we leveled up but because we learned to work better as a team Its a very satisfactory feeling that the game encouragesand designed my character so I can switch from DPS to Tank or Healer or a mix of both when I play with my friends without much of a hassle Ill never be as performing as someone who would 00 specialize in either of these rolesbut I would say that for once hybrid builds are absolutely doable in this gamewhich is very rarely true in MMOsyou will adjust to monsters on the world map and normal delves to a beatable level It does remove true challenge from these areasbut also allows you to roam the world freely to explore as you wishwhich is a worthy trade in my opinion as it allows new players to be free to discover this enormous world like they were on an actual adventure There are also no limits for partying with friendsso you dont need to worry about overleveling when you play on your own While it could take from the satisfying experience of leveling up in early levelsthe very flexible skill system feels like enough of a reward to keep it interestingDungeons and Trials arent scaledand thats where the challenge begins Each dungeon has several levels of difficulty and we have been steadily progressing through them in our 2 months of playing Boss battles require strategy and analyzing the mechanics and can be quite epic Sometimes you just dont have the required level or gearsbut sometimes you just have to keep trying to get better We have beaten many bosses we thought we would never beat on our first couple triesyou start getting Champion Pointsto a maximum of 750 They allow you to keep enhancing your character slowly and end up making quite a difference in the long run As you get strongeryoull be able to complete more difficult dungeonswhich grant better gears This is really clever designas the game never feels like a grind in the traditional MMO sensebut instead more of renewed challenges So far it has kept its freshness to usas its whats been preventing me from playing MMOs for so long In my 2 months of playing I never felt myself even having the desire of grinding for levels or gears I had fun doing quests on my own and playing with my friendsand my character naturally improved by doing so We are still a longlong way from reaching end game contentand are in no hurry From my experiencethis is quite a feat to accomplish this feeling in a genre that is most often grindy by definitionI would say that the game can sometimes feel a little blandbut then again its a MMO and SkyrimDark SoulsWitcher III and the likes have spoiled us in recent years Quests can feel generic and repetitive but you also dont need to do 80 of themand then again it isnt a necessity as you can resell materials instead of holding on to them and ask players to craft for youthe game we were looking for at the right time for us I highly recommend it if you are also looking for a similar chillfriendly experience in the Elder Scrolls universeall gearedvet dungeons kinda lost motivation to play atm tho but it has a lot to do with my friends not being around as muchh├ Digitals Review 👌🏻 ┤hprepare for the longest download 80Gbyoure out of luckpossible freezingcrashing000 Gold While

world map with a ton of cavesand dungeonsto explore Sure there is some cons here and therebut overall I would reccomend this game to any person who enjoys MMOs In the first 23 days of having itI hit 30 hours of gameplay If you got the money and timeid pick this one up for sure And noyou can not do shoutsand there is no dragons This isnt skyrimconsider giving it a thumbs upih The Elder Scrolls

land that is Eastmarch Whilst nothe graphics arent particularly revolutionaryand definitely not the same quality as Skryimthis is to be expected For an MMORPGthe Elder Scrolls Online is up there with one of the best looking Occasionally the world looks a bit the samebut usually as you advance to other provincesthe environment and ambience is noticeably differenton ultracompared to ESOon ultrais more graphically detailed than ESO in my opinion Howeverthis may depend on different viewpoints and whatnot The graphics design and feel each game wishes to portray is differentand this may lead to differences in opinion  which is to be expectedas you gain a considerable amount of experience for each quest you completebut  it does indeed become a chore The characters are forgettablethe quests the same Kill thisgather x amount of thistalk to herhim In my 45 hours of playtimeonly a few quests have got me genuinely interested You skip dialogue as it does not mean anything or add to the plot It doeshoweverreveal some beautiful locations and there are a FEW interesting quests For the most parthoweverPvE in ESOTU is pretty mehdefinitely consider buying it for the PvP aspect It is likely the most fun Ive ever had in an MMORPG Nothing quite compares to standing aside a host of 50 players as trebuchets pound castle wallsthe walls crumbleand hundreds of players clash on the field of battle If youre an Elder Scrolls fan and have always fantasized about some sort of war in Tamriel  buy this game Youre allowed to enter Tamriel at Lvl 0 34 hours of playtime Once you enteryour stats are boosted to Veteran Rank  This means a Level 0 can still be relatively effective fighting higher levelsso its pretty balanced The PvP itself takes place in the Imperial Province of Cyrodiilwhich has been invaded by three seperate factionsWood ElfKhajitOrcRedguardNordDunmer6 of which surround the Imperial City There are also various outposts Around the castles are resourceswhichif capturedgive benefits to the faction who owns themand what convinced me to stay for 00 hoursnot too obtrusive Levelling up is also pretty simple  each time you level upyou get to choose which stat to invest in  staminahealth or magickaYou can then choose a skill which you can plonk in your hotbar and use Nothing broken or overpoweredthough it does take testing to find the most effective skill setsIve not experimented in crafting at allso this section is from friends experiencesthe materials are varied and it does take up time Its not simple Which is goodwith dozens of spells and effects going on as well as 00 players on screen performing their own actionsit did not drop below 50fps Well optimizedlarge scale PvP is the only time Ive ever dropped below 60fpsagainbut not particularly revolutionary or exciting Standard group quests and dungeonpretty simple Not a huge variety right nowI think there are about 78 without the OrsiniumImperial City DLC Ive had loads of fun playing dungeons with friendsbut it does become a bit stagnant once youve repeated them several timesand while the PvE isnt particularly impressiveit still functions Bugs have almost all been ironed out Worth your money if you enjoy the Elder Scrolls universeand are willing to accept certain sacrifices made by Zenimax to make the game a better MMOfeel free to comment constructive criticismpositive feedbackSoI hated this game at firstand I went into it with a mindset of FUCK YEAH MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO  In short dont do that This isnt going to be like playing SkyrimOblivionMorrowindits set in Tamrielit sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game However being an MMOit has a lot of grindy MMO style quests And dont get me wrongits bewildering at firstall these mechanicsall these places to goand before the One Tamriel update if you chose the wrong factionyou were screwedin a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you But thankfully they changed all of that The game scales nowso you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mateand still have some fun slicing up enemiesand spent a few hours installing this to join him By the way its like 70 GigIf you have slow internet prepare for a few days of downloadI got back on it after not playing for 4 monthsbut this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250So I was in luckhe introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing upshowed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my ownwithout any of my friends So I leftand keep in mind I usually hate MMOs never played WoW or anything like thatthis is the first one Im enjoying myselfIm triple digits into this game timewise and I dont see it stopping now Weve made a guild for noobies To help them outand get them to enjoy the game also Because the community is nicebut you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because youre only level 4 But you wont get that when youre in a guildhaving people to play with and explain all the mechanics did helpa lot Ive even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so onwell done I didnt think Id keep you captivated long enough to get to the endon EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the wayadd me or visit our urlwwwgodsofsaltcomwebsiteurl and join us on teamspeakor just message us in game diseasedcrowjust doIm glad I gave it a second chanceIm pushing 500 hours and decided it was time for a review Here you goits a cashgrabbingPVPingmainstreamappealing mess  Which to be fairwas kind of accurate back around initial release from what Ive heard Jump forward give years thoughand its come a looooooooong wayand the game adds its own bits and pieces  some new stuffsome expanding on previous knowledge  And theres plenty of books lying around for the lore enthusiasts to pore over You could quite easily play the game and completely ignore the lore aspectif thats your thingbut youd be missing out on a huge part of the charm of the ES worldboth the main questlines of which there are many and also standalone side quests Keeping in line with previous titles in the seriestheres been an effort made to minimise Go and kill X bandits or Fetch me X golden watercress seeds type quests While ultimately all quests will be basically Go theredo thiscome back they are well presentedrelevant to the storyline and generally cohesivebut thats part and parcel of the MMO genre Occasionally you will meet a new character who obviously thinks they know you  as far as I can tell this is an overhand from early days when different areas of the world were levelledand progress was more linear Modern ESO has levelscaling across the boardmeaning you can access previously endgame zones from the get go Its not gamebreakingand very minor  took me ages to even realise it was happeningheavy attack or block I wassomewhat irked Combat is basically a combination of buffing yourselfdebuffing enemies with abilities and then using normal attacks interspersed with other abilities All these abilities are accompanied by much pomp and circumstance  flamessparklessound effects and such I was kind of miffed that I couldnt just hit things with a swordarrowmorningstar and occasionally swig a health potion Once againits an MMO  not a single player adventure game Took a while to get used tobut you adjust Theres also wiggle room if you want to be more of a puristbut youll be cutting yourself off from most of the groupendgame activities by doing soSorceror is the Mage and TemplarsDragonknights and Wardens are a bit of a mixed bag Theres less of a WarriorMageThief theme and more of a DamageHealerTank vibe to the whole affairdue to the traditional 4 man party setup for group activities Too much reading online will convince you that to be any good at all you need to shoehorn yourself into the current meta build for whatever role you want to fill Reading these guides and builds is a great way to understand how to use skills more effectively or learn how different armour sets can help in combatbut at the end of the day theyre best ignored Play the character you want to play  if you were good enough to benefit from squeezing an extra 6 DPS out of your toon you wouldnt need to read a guide to find out how to do itwith passives that are vaguely in line with with the old Altmer have extra magickaKhajiit be sneaky stuff Nothing to prevent you from making an Orc healer or an Altmer brawler if you wishthoughalways feel free to ask questions in zone chat if you need a hand with something Lots of helpful sorts out there PUGs can be a bit toxic sometimesbut its easy to just leave the group if you cant be bothered dealing with someone excessively unpleasant Hundreds of guilds to joineverything from trading to roleplaying to hardcore score pushers On that noteif youre trying to do an endgame trial and suckthe other people are NOT being toxic Theres an expectation that you will contribute effectivelyand if youre notwell tough potatoesarmor and weapon style diagramsfoodstuffsraw resources and other shiny bits and bobs Level up your crafting skills and you can make your own gearmake furniturepotionspoisons to use or sell You can also just go out foraging for stuff and sell your spoils through a guild for a tidy profit Nice lowkey way to spend an hour or two if you dont feel like combat or questing and just want to romp around outside enjoying the landscapetheres a Crown Store where you can buy stuff with your IRL fundage I dont think many people use it Lots of flashy stuff and lots of cosmetics that after a few weeks of playing you can mostly find or make yourself ingame Subscribing to ESO Plus gets you an unlimited inventory for crafting resources very handy and access to all the DLC content which can also be purchased oneoff if you prefer It also gives you 500 crowns per monthso you can fritter it away on the more usefulappealing items if you so wish The game is fully playable without subscribingits really just a QOL improvement and means you dont have to pay upfront for the many DLC zonesboth geographically and in terms of content New areas are being released regularly and despite the whining on forumsthe dev team does a good job of addressing issues and making the game enjoyableaccessible and true to the lore of the Elder Scrolls universe  You can play this as an MMOa singleplayer game or anything in between You can RP your way through the overland regionsor minmax your way onto some very competitive leaderboards  For meits a great continuation of he Elder Scrolls series and also a very enjoyable and affordable MMO without that horrible WoW feel to it Youre not forced into any particular playstyle based on your class or raceand theres enough content to keep anyone busy for many thousands of hoursor MMOsor RPGs in generalI suggest you give it a try Its a bit of a mixed bagbut such a large bag that youll never get boredIve thought a lot about whether to give this game a bad review or not I almost didbut it would be unfair to the game The largest and most painful issue I have with this game is the ingame shop and the way that this game has been monetized It is so terribly monetizedthat I almost gave this game a negative review ZOS claim to only sell cosmetics and convenienceshowever both of these things clash with the core gameplay of ESOand with extremely expensive costs too The game is objectively worse off by the existence of these things I can count on one hand the number of mounts you can collect in gamebut the number of mounts you can buy or obtain through ZOSs loot boxes is closer to 00 This gives players less things to actually play forless things to collect and fewer targets to set for themselvesyou can buy timesavers which grant you ability points if youve collected them on other charactersexperience scrollsmount training and the research scrolls for professions The issue I take with the existence of these items is indicative of the fact that ZOS are aware that these grinds are a slug They are literally timegated you can learn one mount training skill every 24 hoursof which there are 80 skills to spend That is half a year of spending points to max out your mount training This grind must be done on each character The research scrolls speed up the rate at which you research a trait in a weapon When researching a traityou must wait an increasing amount of actual time before unlocking it and researching another My main character has gotten to the point that she must wait 20 days to learn a new trait in some professions Or I can throw my wallet at ZOS and get it done instantly ZOSI want to play your gamebut youre making it so hard000 crowns €85 and are unobtainable otherwise On the other hand the housing system in the game is phenomenal It suffers a lot though when considering how expensive furnishings actually areespecially when compared to how little gold you actually get for just playing the game While players can obtain some furniture pieces through playing the gamethese are extremely few and far between when considering just how many furniture pieces there actually are in the game The nicer furniture pieces are often priced at 0000 goldup to 00000 for the fanciest pieces When you only get 300 gold for completing a questas a playeryou must look to get money through other systems if you want to engage fully with housing and furnishing ZOSPLEASE increase the amount of gold you get from quests This leads me to the auction house in gameand ESO plusis by engaging in the auction house I love the auction house system in the gameand the way it forces players to be a part of a guilds One thing to help you make gold is the use of the extra bank storage and literally infinite crafting bag you get when subscribing to ESO plus If you plan to sell any crafting materials and you dont have the crafting bagbe prepared to have a full inventory every 0 minutes Its like ZOS are aware that not playing with the crafting bag is a handicapand so they move it to a paywall There are other ways to make money in the gamesuch as farming for rare item drops for hours on endhoping that one will eventually drop which you can sell for a lottery cash outand I never feel satisfied playing this game I want to engage in the housingbut the rate at which I can actually buy furnitureif I just do quests is extraordinarily slow The crowns I get with the ESO plus subscription make it a bit betteras they allow me to buy furniture and housing with crowns instead of goldbut I cant help but feel like this doesnt have to be a problem at allfix your monetization I paid for this gamelet me play it without locking features behind timegates and paywalls If you want this game to be subscription basedmake it subscription basedput everything from the store into the gameand remove the store You cant have it both ways I want to love this gamebut with the way this game is monetizedI cantyou will probably enjoy the game if you dont engage with any of the things above But you might get frustrated at always having a full backpack and having to walk past all of the mining and herb nodes because you dont have the space to pick them up And then not having any money because you cant trade the materials you dont haveEDIT 202 No longer recommendthey sold all their players personal information ill never support them again Evermost people come into it expecting Skyrim online DO NOT DO THISas this needs to be notedi can go into pretty much every building i come across Other mmos dont do this Other mmos dont have things scattered across their dungeons to loot aside from corpses Someone else might say well i cant pick up everything like i can in Skyrim No you cantbut what mmo lets you In this you can at least interact with objects more than other gamesyou have to block and dodge You cant get away with auto attacking They have improved the feel of combatyou dont feel like you are slicing thin air anymoreeager to group upeager to role play and get into character No one is arguing in the chat No one is spamming to sell you goldcollecting the reagents you need isnt a chore because the world is fun to explore and gather in There are plenty of recipes to find and experiment withits not mind blowing greatbut it does look goodespecially for an MMO This isnt going to look like a graphic mod for Skyrim so forget that But its no slouch either The lighting is very well done but some textures can be blanddozens of skills to choose from which only get added on from joining things like the fighters and mages guild or becoming a werewolf or vampire You can use any weapon and any armor typethere are thousands of builds for each class The best customization i have ever seen and ive been a rabid MMO gamer since 2003pet and costume They dont pester you for money with pop ups or anything annoying like that You buy the game and you choose to purchase aesthetics on your own termsi am enjoying my time in the game as a slow burn and i recommend you do the same DO NOT be in a rush to get to cap Live in the worldenjoy your ascentim sure its going to be very popular when it launches on consoles and the PC community seems to be growing now that the game is B2PI lost my life to this gameand soon itll be easier to grind out equipment with the curated drops system so you wont have to spend almost 67 hours trying to get the equipment like I didAfter reading all the negative comments about paywallssubscriptionsand overpriced items I was hesitant to buy this gameand have logged on every day for the past 2 monthsand so many questsmy quest log is constantly filled to max capacityand I havent felt the need to get a subscriptionfor which I need to pay real moneysave up gems and get what you wantperhaps there are better options out therelike methis is by far the best value I have ever got from any gameTheir last privacy agreement update January st202 states they will sell users informationincluding nameemail and billing address to third party companies including social media and advertising There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those termsvery sad practices for a paid game reallyh Gambles ESO REVIEW hafter years of playing other different types of games i decided i needed my MMORPG fix again I was not sure what to expect but i knew i was a fan of The Elder Scrolls Universeplaying most the previous games in the series and being a big fan of the lore so i decided to give the online version a chancei was thinking do i really want to pay more money after just buying the game After asking a few of my friends who had played the game before i did more digging and found out i
1,Im an older womanand I find that this game appeals to all ages  I have sooo many hours into this game and I love it  I admit I need my sons help and his friends to get me through things sometimes when its a monster thats kicking my butt  Im now at the stage where I can do it on my own  I think they did an amazing job with this game  It doesnt matter how old you arethis is so fun  I highly recommend this game  Thanks for doing such a great job with this gameI waited until I had at least 1 hours on PC to write this review Honestly theres so much to say about this game Been a fan of the series ever since Triand I sank 8 hours into MHGU which you can now buy on switchwhich is dopeslapping on a few monster partsthen calling it a day rather than creating a new design that creatively incorporates the actual design of the monster its made from HOWEVERlots of the newest endgame weapons that were introduced in the Iceborne expansion are more creative and look fantastic With the addition of layered weaponsthis is less of a problem since you can make a bland weapon look like an endgame weapon or at least have it match your outfitthere are 68 large monsters to fight vs 93 large monsters in MHGU Howeverin MHWabout 5 of these monsters are either tied to limited events or are not really noteworthy zorah is pretty boring imo So that leaves around 63 monsters 5 more monsters are tied to the late game where you have to rank up enough to grind and unlock them So that leaves you with around 58 monsters for at least the first 3 hours of the game MHGU gives you 93 monsters that unlock as you naturally progress through the gamewith 18 of those monsters being deviant versions that can progress alongside your hunter rank so that they scale into late game with proper rewards once you get there Additionallythe monster diversity in MHGU is a lot higher Theres giant frogsbig mammothsmore monkeysgiant crabsgiant snakesgiant spidersetc Keep in minda lot of the monsters in MHW are ALSO in MHGUwhereas the opposite is not true Iceborne helped to alleviate the diversity in MHWbut not nearly to the degree of it solving the problemso grinding is a huge part of the game This point is mainly for people whove never played the series MH is a grind To get better weapons and armoryou have to farm the monster enough times until it finally drops the parts that you need Then you need to grind it again for the armor And if you want other armors or weaponsyou have to grind those too With the addition of Iceborneif you want to unlock the true endgame contentyou need to grind your rank and farm the correct monsters to unlock the other monsters Then you need to make sure you have enough supplies so that you can craft enough ammopotionsetc Grindgrindgrind If you are not a fan of repetitionthis is NOT the game for you If youre a veteran of the seriesthis point should basically be meaningless Why do you think I have 1 hours and Im still playingG rank hunts were more dangerous compared to Master rank hunts in Iceborne There are a lot of factors regarding the difficulty which people tend to either overlook or disregard In the old gamesmonster animations were a lot less telegraphed Some attacks would happen with very little warning visuallyand sometimes you had to guess which move would come out Healing was different because you ate a potionthen stood around and flexed for 5 seconds with nothing to do except wait for the animation to finish Skill trees were harder to customize because you had to hit a certain threshold of skill points before the skill would even activate Not to mention armor parts had less slots for your decorations Monster attacks did much more damage because there were less upgrades available to your armor Combine all of these together and you get hunts that were more dangerous because visual cues were less forgivingyou took more damagehad less skills availableand healing made you a sitting duckmonster animations are much more telegraphedwhich is much more fair imo It makes more sense that you can see a monster wind up to perform a strong move instead of the monster standing still for 3 framesthen unleashing a move that could kill you This means theres less BS moments when it comes to taking damage If you got hitchances are you saw it coming but mightve been preoccupied with something else Healing is different because you can now drink a potion while moving instead of standing around and waiting for the animation to finish Againthis is another QOL improvement that makes more sense and leaves less room for BS or blaming the crappy controls Skills are more easily available because even if you only have a single point in a skillyou can at least gain a minor benefit of that skill Armor parts have more slots for decorationsso skills are even more accessible Finallyarmor parts have more upgrade levels This is more just putting 2 and 2 together If you have more upgrades to your armoryou take less damagebut really theyve just fixed a lot of the annoying issues in the old games and given the player more tools at their disposal If you really want to emulate the difficulty of the older gamesdont upgrade your armor so highdont use the meta setsuse less decorations so that you have less skillsand stand in 1 spot while you drink your potions The beauty of this game is that youre not forced to always use the best gear or all of the tools at your disposal You can choose to make things more difficult for yourself if you want to But if you use all the best gear and you complain that the game is too easythen thats a personal issuethen you have a wealth of positive things to look forward tocraftingmovesetsloading timesetc If youre a fan of the seriesI think youll love the changes Now that a lot of the old crap mechanics are goneeverything feels so much smoother and streamlined Farming supplies is so much easierweapon trees and stats are way more clearitem boxes are all over the base instead of a single locationetctheir weaknesseshow to prep for the fightetc And when it all comes togethertheres something so satisfying about all your hard work paying off Of course you could just go braindead and wack them until they diebut to each their ownthis game is a grind You grind for armorweaponssuppliesupgradesequipmentdecorationsetc Grinding is part of the core gameplayso once you finish the storytheres still plenty more to work towardsmovesets were expanded Everything just got betterand with more monsters to boot A must have imothis game is more than worth the purchase And at the end of the dayyoure fighting beastsdinosaursand fucking dragons What more could you wanth1Most enjoyable grind everh1it is what the name tells you – a monster hunter game You hunt monstersgather resourcescraft new gear to hunt stronger monsters to get better gear That’s itvery simple formulabut gameplay is really amazingunlock better gear and stronger monsters and when you finish the story the real grind begins The grind is in no way bad in this game Yes sometimes when you’re short on some common items going to hunt some weak monster could feel like a waste of timebut most of the time you’ll be hunting strong monstersyou need to read their moves and prepare for their attacks You can’t just run to the monster and mash the attack button to kill it This tactic would only work on monsters bellow your level First you need to choose the right gear with right stats for each monster You need to avoid strong attacks and find a window to hit the monster and use healing items You can also use other items like traps to capture the monsterbut first you need to weaken it You can cutoff and break various parts of monsterslike cutting off the tail for example After you finish the monster you can collect its parts and use them on crafting weapons and armor Oh and one more thing – you can use environment to your advantagelike shooting a huge rock which falls on a monster Or another monster could wonder into the same place and attack the monster you’re fightingbut some of them feel very similar to each other They look similar and their moves are very similar I wish we had more completely different monsters I know dragons are fun and cool looking but it’s a gamedevelopers could think of a way to add different monster while not completely breaking the lore Wouldn’t it be nice to have a bearlike monster which could give you a deathly bearhugFinal Fantasy which lets you turn your Palico into Mog or Witcher There’s even a Witcher questline and a monster from Witcher universe to fightso you can fire up the SOS flare and wait until someone comes to help you Or you can jump into someone’s session who’s doing the quest you need and help him thus completing the quest for both of youI guess it’s running on an old enginebut overall graphics are good looking Performance on the other hand could be better It’s not badbut if you want to have 6fps on max settings you’ll need a powerful PC The world is well crafted and locations look amazing Maps are huge and there are lots of things to discovermany of them feel too similar to each otherThis game is absolutely fantastic and is a blast with friendsthe upgradingand customizing of equipment and armors Alsoyou take away from the challenge of hunting monsters by giving yourself this Base endgame set right at the get gothen come back and try a different weapon and absolutely love the game me includedtalk to the Housekeeper palicoand access training You can change between all 14 different weapon sets in the training areaIm in my mid 4s so I dont always have a lot of time to play games but Monster Hunter World has me hooked Since I only can devote about an hour or so every night I just set a goal of what I want to do such as killing or trapping Anjanath to gather parts for the armor set Its slow going for mebut I dont mind taking my time because the fights are fantastic and sometimes last 2 minutes or more of pure adrenalinepulsing bliss where a welltimed Palico heal or quick dodge or a perfectly aimed hit makes you feel like you are actually fighting a real monster and that your own life is really on the lineits dropdead gorgeous and runs at a nice butterysmooth 6fps on my RTX 26 and Ryzen 5 26x with 16GB RAMand overall its just insanely funIf you ever get bored of the endgame grindheres a small list of things to do that may make you feel a little happytry to learn them all Youll definitely find something that fits you bestbut knowing another weapon makes you want to do hunts again and again You will get a lot more hours doing thisor with randoms While in most gamesplaying with randoms can hinder your gaming experiencebut thats with all multiplayer games There are bad applesbut in a coop gametheyre not nearly as problematic When playing with peopleyou can and will have moments that will highten your experience Like in Level 6 Kulve Tarothjumping down and breaking her gold coating on the horns with just one hit while your teammates drop rocks on her tailwhile also ruining her precious golden mantle You can seriously get a good sense of comradery when playing with people As for friendsdo the same thingbut also take on hunts that challenge you If you find a monster annoyingkeep fighting him Learn his quirks This game is as much a learning game as it is a fun game Learn weaponslearn monstersbut explore and capture small creatures you find This game has fantastic monster behaviours In the Rotten ValeI suddenly found myself next to an Odogaronand I prepared to fight him after he roaredbut soon he continued walking away Following him from a distanceI then found him going about his daily routinewhich was scavenging for food to bring back to his den Every monster has their own quirks out of combat Theyre not soulless creatureswhich makes the experience even more fun knowing that they are closer to animals than virtual creatures created for slayingdo all the quests Optional questsother quests Every quest Blue completed optional quests do not countyou must make them orange Do thisand reach HR1 so that you can simulate the final episode of Neon Genesis Evangelion and just be congratulated by everyonemake your own buildsuse whatever weapons you want Every weapon is viable in this game If you like the look of a weaponuse it It doesnt mattermake it yours You can use meta weapons and meta buildsand while it may be fun for a whileit may get dull Do something uniquetake chances with your builds and find something that suits you Vitality decorations mat be useless for someones buildbut it may save the life of a build built around fast regeneration and maximum immortalityso excuse typosor maybe itll conjure a few hundred Anything and everything you can do to help your endgame grindfind itTLDR this is how you fix a title from an imperfect launch Good dev responseimportant features added Capcom caresever Excellent fixesgreat work from the developers and community managers  little to no BSmouse fixesnetwork fixesprolonged eventsand continued support for those with continued network issues While a clumsy launch is always best to avoidthe gameplay and response from Capcom to the issues theyve caused has been more than acceptable These guys care about making a good game into a great onePretty funboth solo and multidont believe the mixed reviews those were all due to the bad launchthe game is a very solid edition to the franchise and as its own game Its very friendly to newcomers and challenge ramps up as you progress through the vibrant New Worldgathercraft setsget better gearweaponsto hunt bigger monsters Gear only helps you up until a certain pointskill will still win the dayi like hitting the monster but i dont like it

finishside questsevent questsspecial assignments to take part inyou get thrown into the land and have to find out how stuff workstheres little to no explanation You get some sort of a visualized guide by flies that show you the correct path  but they will confuse you sooner or laterIm now close to 14h into the game and cant wait for the Iceborne expansionmaybe two chances when you think Nothis is not for me It most definitely isGOOD GAME  Have not encountered any bugs so far Not a Review Support in other video games Cast HealCast HealCast Healooga booga hitting big animals fun caveman brain satisfiedFor MHW veterans on consoles This version has faster loading times compared to the consolesyou will be impressedits not impressivesomething LowMid for today standardsso I left AMD FreeSync on just in case and worked so far The thing isthe builtin VSync in the game is very taxingbut the fps jump is kinda noticeable as wellspecially in open areas which is VERY common in the game Since Im playing on a 49 HDTV from a distance I cant tell much of a differenceso I leave it in Lowfortunately FPS is stable at maxbut I currently suffer from FPS drop even if leaving it on lowthe bane of the FPS Console users will recognize it as the fogthe one to blame all those fps drops it adds more detail in the areas with all the lightning and stuffbut you cant see past the fog sometimes This is no Nintendo 64so no need to leave it onbut it definitely wont bother youalso you will save a lot of FPSI use AMDs AA 8xEQ with Multisampling AA Method and it does a better job than the game with their own settingswhich makes blurry edgesspecially FXAA Jaggies can be seenbut doesnt bother me that muchbut the drop in FPS is kinda noticeablebut it does bother me the lack of detail in objects sometimesso I leave it in No Limitalsoit doesnt punish my FPS that hardnor alivedefinitely looks bad without itspecially in cutscenesbut I liked the detail FPS may varybetween your hunterand the camera  get diffusedtransparent and leave some dots all over the object Supposedlyyou can try to remove the dots by making them blurrier with this optionbut its very taxing on FPSso I leave it on Lowfortunately not taxingeven if the game tells you Had no issues with FPS dropsso I left it OnI can review the game for what it isbut a lot of comments here already explained what it is abouthow does it feelwhat workswhat doesnt so Im gonna try my best to do a brief reviewits one of my favorites of the year so far Havent played a MonHun title beforebut I can tell there were a lot of improvementslike real open areas and be able to move while drinking potionsarmorand accessories to go hunt more powerful and dangerous monsters Rinse and repeatyou may spend more than an hour trying to create your prefered hunterand palico Palico are the little cat helpers that hunt with youand its fairly balancedthe game is about hunting monstersnot other huntersyou can play with other 3 players in a single quest and do whatever you want in the area scavenging for bonesitemsgemsand of coursehunting monstersand more options are unlocked as you progress during the main storynor botanynor meldernor other shops that you will use a lot in the main tradeyard hub in Astera the only reason you would go to the gathering hub is to do exclusive Arena questsdepending on your pacing But I would say finishbecause a lot of content opens up afterwardsalso the team releases free DLC monsters and events and hopefully will continue to do so throughout the yearit has some issues that people are currently facing and let me tell youTHEY WERE THE SAME IN THE CONSOLE VERSIONS More speficallyabout the disconnections And guess what As of todayseems that issue was fixed at least on the PS4 I had no idea why it happens on PCbut the port job is not perfect You will face with random disconnections all the timeso get used to it until they fix the problemspecially when approaching to the chest when arriving into a questyour hunter will crouch instead of opening the chest Its a minor detailbut it bothers me sometimesbut updates fixed my problem in AMD RadeonI would suggest to use a controller instead if youre in that position I currently use a DualShock 4 paired with my PC via Bluetooth and works great The only issue is that the game doesnt recognize it as a PS4 controller and will show you an Xbox One button layout insteadsince its an Xbox One portI tried a wired Xbox 36 controller to play the game and works perfectlymusic is greatgameplay is satisfyingit has a LOT of replayabilityeven after finishing the main storyI would definiltely recommend Monster Hunter WorldI would recommend to wait a bit before buying Monster Hunter WorldI would recommend to visit the discussions section to get more info about the game and see if youre convinced into buying itpersonallyI recommend this game for its gameplay and replayabilitybut maybe NOT in the current state with random disconnectionsit definitely can be betterAs a part of buying a new Nvidia GTX 16I received a game for free named Monster Hunter World A gamewhich I had no clue what it was all aboutmainly due to my lack of knowledge of the previous Monster Hunter installments from Capcom I didnt even try to play the gameuntil one month latera land mass filled with monsters Along with the Research Commission that studies the land and its monstersfrom a region named Astera The player begins the game by commencing a quest in Ancient Forestalong with the characterI had also commenced my journey  a journey to the amazing world of Monster Hunter What an amazing journey it has been How do I even begin to explainconsists of many distinct regions like  Ancient ForestWildspire WasteCoral HighlandsRotten ValeElders RecessHoarfrost Reach and Guiding Lands Each and every regionalong with its tundrathe materialsthe flora and faunathe wildlife are distinctly different from one another The joy I had in discovering the regionseven the smallest of themwere nothing short of amazing The amount of time spent on collecting materials from these regions is insanesince there is always something you would have missedthe player starts with the most basic of armorweapons and eventually progress by defeating stronger monstersthereby getting better weaponsgear The real beauty of the game is that it allows so many different ways to achieve thiswith the help of 14 types of weapons Weaponswhich i have never heardseen or used before in any games Each and every weapon is uniquehas its pros and cons and not to mention their unique moves I started the base game with dual bladesswitched to bow till i reached a certain level and then changed to my favourite weapon charged blade My current go to weapon being Long sword I can keep on writing about the weaponsbut it is something a player has to experiencepersist and then slowly try to master it Players will have a total different experience in taking on the same monsters with different weaponsthe materials needs might be different and skills attached to it as wellhow to build the gear around itthe preparation  in identifying the monsters weaknessthe food the player needs to eat from canteen before a battlehow to use the environments in players favourhowwhen to use traps Lastdefintely not the least and certainly the most important  studyingunderstanding monster movementsthere by developing positional awareness in battles This is crucial and is the main difference between a good hunt and tedious one where the player rage quits The concept is simplebut learning curve is steep and the player needs to persist with itinorder to have the best game experience Monsters can still wreck you even after this weaknessmovements and attacks are so different  that it shows the amount of work Capcom has put into them I have lost count on the amount of monsters and their variants available in this game This is nothing short of exceptional Monsters are so diverse and so much in much in number that I can write an entire section dedicated only about the monsters in the gamesince mostly i prefer only the single player side of things  The in game experience quadriples when you go to an hunt with a full team of 4  something i enjoy very much to this day and always brings a smile to my face I have been extremely lucky in becoming friends with exceptional group of players and to this day we hunt as team And that list just keeps on growingbut still needs immense GPU power to play it smoothly The online server disconnectsglitches like playes landing on impossible areas and not to mention the insane grindinorder to get jewelsweapons and armorthe game is still extremely addictive I have played close to 265 hours  managed to learn and use frequently 7 diffrerent types of weapons and still play with my friends as much as possible There are so many things I have missed to address This is mainly due to the immense depth of MHWthe amount of layers the game hasthat I find it next to impossible to explain each and every aspect of it Not to mention the events which keeps on pulling players to the game as frequently as possible  hats of Capcomyou have created an absolute beastplaying it almost every other day The journey which commenced with me stepping into a world completely newstill continues and I am pretty much sure is gonna last for a long time Quoting one of my friends  its that time of the day  time to bully the monstersh1First Monster Hunterh1but Im also gonna explain what it isand why it’s so damn funthere are 5 big open worldsmaps These maps have huge monsters that you have to track downkilland harvest their glorious innards You yourself do not level up You’ll pick from 1 of 14 weapons which is like your classand you can switch em out as well if you wanna try others and craft better weapons and armor from the parts you farm from monsters You have a central hub Astera you’ll probably spend a lot of your time inrunning side missionswhile also progressing through the story and unlocking new mapsmonstersand addingupgrading beneficial NPC hubs  within Astera There’s so much content in this game it’s ridiculousconfusing and pretty damn difficult You’ll prob have to google some sht and some of the fightsespecially your first time going incan last up to 3 minutes You’ll have to learn the fightslearn the environmentslearn your weaponand learn what items you’ll need to bring You craft almost everything in the gamefrom the coatings on your arrowsfoodtrapsto different potions for different situations Everything is harvestable from the world plantsnutsanimalsbugsfishingetcallowing you to take on stronger monsters as you become more powerfulit’s worse for people who try and run match making exclusively Me and my friends alonewe have connection issues but it’s not nearly as bad as others are reporting Im not saying the problem doesn’t existbut for us its not unplayable   Honestly it has varied daytoday Some days are worse than others When it does happenit literally take 51 seconds to reconnect Sht can be frustrating at timesespecially mid fightbut it’s not something thats constantly happening to uswhen you’re out on a huntyou can send up an “SOS” If you or someone else needs a part from a certain monsterthey can respond to this sos and now you have a party of 4 going after the same target This is the only way I play MP when not playing with friendsand againI haven’t had a terrible experience with it It has issues like the rest of the game’s connection issues but nothing as broken as Ive read in various forums I have never tried to connect to match making so I cant comment on that outside what others are saying There are currently 2 patches Capcom have been testing that are showing up in steamdb I should also note that I usually dont play until after 7pm estmaybe I’m just lucky There are reportedly fixes but I haven’t had to do anything 98tii5 467klatest Nvidia driver and I’m running 56 fps midhigh settings 256x144 I do get dips in the 4s but againnothing game breakingnot for me at leastgoals to set on what you wanna do nexthelping each other out and so on The above issues are from my personal experience and in no way am I saying those problems don’t exist It’s a fcking fantastic game that’s unfortunately getting review bombed due to Capcom’s slow or almost lacking I should say responsethe same day I posted this reviewCapcom patched the game The patch was intended to reduce connection issues for folks while they continued to iron it out Ive had about 3 hrs play time sinceand have honestly had  connection issuesplaying as I domentioned in the review Playing with friends in our own lobbiesor running SOS missions I have had  disconnects MW errors Every single MP mission Ive started with friends or ran in SOSs since the patch has ended without a single connection drop Some people are still reporting issues with match making or joining random lobbies I cant comment on these issues since I dont ever join themIgnore the connection issues negative reviewsDont let the mixed overall reviews scare youthe game is very enjoyable in its current state With the connection issues gone and several bugs fixedit can only go upwards from here Alsonew content is added every few weeks together with eventssliding downhill to launch an aerial attack and so onsonic bombsetcbut can also be used to travel around the environment faster hooking onto a wingdrake for examplewhich can turn the hunt to your favoryou shouldnt have any problems figuring them out even if this is your first MHwith plenty of gadgets to help you outthis is the only downside reallyfor both newcomers and fans of the MH franchisei could find a perfect jobbought a nice carand also find the right girl but instead i spend 3 hours on this game

applicableculturaltechnological or domination Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victoryyou can go for the others Each AI opponent has their own personalityand are pretty predictable in how they behave Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasionwhile Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and cultureculture doesnt automatically take over neighbors cities anymorebut any game that I log 200 hours on over a period of years and still havent come close to doing everything is doing something right A great game from a great seriesLove this gameI bought it for my grandpa originally and he played it non stop til he passed away I believe he had around 600 hours on it So from a 66 year old and a 17 year old collectively enjoy this gamethe mods you can get are insane and enjoyable I wish I could play it more for him but life does push you to do other things21 now and almost done with college this game really takes your mind off of things I will likely continue to play

dynamics to gameplay easily making this the most exciting and in depth of the franchisedispite them groaning about it not being an action game or something like Candy Crush We all know the types  Needless to saycoming back and seeing how they were doing 3 hours later and noticing that they havnt changed position on their chairhas always been a moment that makes me smile  I have spread the addiction  HuzzahAs a Native American I was glad to finally see a game that accurately portrays our culture I will never forget the day we built the pyramids on a grassland hillor who could forget when we used mega death robots to destroy the incan empire for  trying to convert our cities to Confuciacism 1010Never  Trust  GhandiAs a founding player of Sid Meiers Civ  game and playing for some 20 years I think I have a bit of a idea of this game I still have my copies on floppy diskCD  DVD There have been a lot of changes to this gamesome for the better and many for the determent to interactive game playnot to mention the fails on the bugs and crashes along the waybut after some 14369 hours played I think I have worked around most of them000 to 8000 points a game and dont think too hard on the strategy and I rarely lose a unit in any gamehappy gamingYou can play this game with one hand while eating food with the otherCivilization V is not a new game On the contraryits almost seven years ago Its sequelCivilization VIhas been out for almost a year Despite thatI find myself repeatedly coming back to Civilization V to get my 4X eXploreeXpandeXploiteXterminate strategy game fix Having gotten back on a Civilization kick this past week or soI plan to review Civilization VI before too longbut before I doI thought it would be good to go back to the game that got me fullon addicted to the serieshaving you build from a single settler unit and a warrior unit to  hopefully  a massive empire turning the world green with envy with your religionculturescienceeconomyand military might The base game includes 18 unique civilizationseach with their own unique unitstraitsstrengthsand weaknesses There are two major expansions that add an additional 18 civilizations along with a few more minor DLC packs that add another seven civilizations for a grand total of 43 Its not just the ingame differences that make these civilizations unique but the detail that went into them every civilization leader is fully animated and complete with lines of dialogue spoken in the leaders native tongue For examplewhen interacting with the Romansyoull see Augustusthe first Roman Emperorfully animated with lines recorded in Latin When interacting with the Aztecsyoull see Moctezuma I nothats not a typo speaking Nahuatl While its not exactly a work of historical factobviouslyas a history teacherthe amount of detail that went into the leaders and their presentation makes me absolutely giddyyou have the tried and true domination victory in which you must crush your enemies As of the Brave New World expansionyou must control all players original capitals including your own to achieve a domination victorymeaning that you could technically win through domination without actually wiping out a single civilization Leaving them alivehoweverwill obviously give them incentive to retaliate and rid their capital of your filth You also have the option of a science victoryrequiring you to complete certain research projectsbuildand be the first to launch a starship to Alpha Centauri Cultural victory involves making your culture so vibrant and desirable through various policy upgrades thatin turnend up influencing your Tourism that other civilizations citizenry all start to prefer your culture over any other Diplomatic victory involves progressing to the point where the World Congress is created and then develops into the United Nations From thereyou must attain enough votes from your own delegates as well citystates or  if they have no sense of selfpreservation  other empires to be elected world leader by the UN The last victory type is the time or score victory Unless this victory type is disabledwhoever has the highest total score by 2050 AD thats turn 500 on standard speed is the winner Score is determined by pretty much everything  gold in your treasuryunits you possessresearch youve doneterritory you controlthe number of cities in your empirethe population of your empireits an exhaustive listbut the idea is straightforward  the highest score wins Of these various victory typescultural is probably the most obscure due to the lessthanstraightforward relation between the culture that generates your policy upgrades and the tourism stat that actually triggers the victoryyou can start wrecking shit right off the bat If youre more into the empire building aspect than the empire conquering aspect like meyou can build up your empire relatively peacefullymaintaining just a defensive army or no army and focusing on sciencecultureand city growth Diplomacywhile having some flaws in Civ Vallows for relatively peaceful interactions as well as confrontation with various trade options and a few different kinds of pacts you can pursue with other nations Making all of this better is the option of playing online with a mix of people and CPUs My favorite thing to do is play with a couple of friends and handful of computer players and  hopefully  keep a relatively cooperativepeaceful relationship with my human counterparts Its a lot like Risk in that there are some backroom deals going on but unlike Riskavoiding confrontation is a perfectly viable optionin my opinionthe absolute pinnacle of strategy game perfection at the time of its release As my first main Civilization game excluding the spinoff Civilization Revolutionits secured both a very special place in my heart as well as the status of being my primary point of reference when playing any other Civilization or 4X strategy game While there are a few areas that I think could have been improvedits still a definite masterpiece of strategy design The detail of the mapsthe variety of strategic and luxury resources to claim and exploitthe diplomatic aspectsthe number of different victory typesand the diverse array of civilizations from which to choose all make this game truly mind blowing when you stop and think about it If you have any interest at all in strategy gamesId give this one a go With Civilization VI having been on the market for nearly a yearCiv V isnt too pricey these daysand its still an amazing experienceand thats even before you take into account the various and often hilarious mods on the Steam Workshop that you can download Of all the games Ive recommendedthis is one of the most highly recommendedhands down
1,I am over 70 and I play because of the strategyhand and eyechallenges and the ease of the gameLets face it youre not reading reviews for Age of Empires II because youve never heard of it before you want to know how the Definitive Edition adds or takes away from experiencing one of the most popular RTS games of all time Coming from someone who has played Age of Empires II regularly since its release in 1999 I own the diskssupported the HD versionand now thisIm so happy with this My review will focus on updates and changesgood and badfor players already wellversed with the older versions of the gamethis game looks gorgeous iwithout sacrificing the original aesthetici This is important Im not a huge graphics gal if it looks prettygreat But how does it PLAY I worried that all the updates would turn one of my favorite games of all time into one that barely resembled what I knowand that isnt the case Though everything is updatedfrom the tiniest fishing boat to each tree and forage bushit all resembles its original aesthetic Snow glistens Fish swim in schools beneath crystal clear waves Clicking on the ground to approve the construction of a building puts its blueprint outline down in a satisfying burst of dustbut some choices were made thatwhile unnecessaryare only appealing For examplewhile foraging a bushit loses its robustness over time before becoming sparse just before it depletes The same happens with ore mines And oh my GOODNESSdestroying buildings is so supremely satisfying Rather than just gain flames before instantly turning into rubblethe building collapses in spectacular fashioneach brick and shattered piece of glass tumbling to the ground under a cloud of dust Different architecture leads to matching piles of rubble To say Im impressed by this is an extreme understatementand I found myself so frustrated with the updated AI It ruined the game Allies would build one army and thenonce killedwould literally stop playing Like the HD versionthe Definitive Edition allows you to choose from CD AI and even the HD AI if you choosebut they have their updated version as well I have yet to play with the updated AIso I cant speak as to its nature But once you choose the CD AIthe option sticks unlike the HD versionwhere you had to choose it every time All the commands work and have been updated with new voiceover HoweverI couldnt find the taunts Edit Nevermind I simply couldnt find them in the longer list of chat commands Woololo to your hearts contentthere are certain memorable beats to the old tunes that are dulled in the updated version On one handthe music gets less repetitive by taming these memorable partsbut on the other handthe old soundtrack is the best and I want to hear itthe game runs well on its highest settings for me Every once in a while itll lag a bitI think that coincides with autosavesbut not often enough to be an issue I play on ludicrous size maps with 8 playersso there are always tons of armies and chaos on screen Speaking of mapsthe selection here is wonderful All the original types of random maps are hereand there are added types including migration mapsthat are low on initial resources and cause you to battle it out while trying to grow your empire Additionallyyou gain additional options when it comes to the kind of random map you want to play Selecting waterbasedfor one examplewill select all waterheavy types of maps and choose randomly You can also literally choose each individual type of map youre open to and apply the settingswhich is awesome if you like collecting relics to grow your gold reserves I havent run low on gold yetand Ive played around a dozen maps thus far Mills and docks now give you the option to reseed farms and fish traps automatically as long as you have the resourcesinfinitely The days of crazily clicking to fill your reseed queue are gratefully over There are tons of minimap options herebut theyve taken away the combateconomic options Edit My mistakethey simply moved it to a new toggle buttonSometimes the game suffers from odd glitches where someone will resign and the game wont notify you youll just notice their name crossed out in the corner if you select the scores to show up above the minimap Every once in a while units will slide across the mapand Ive witnessed monks moonwalking more than once I find both these glitches hilarious and would rather them not be fixedto be honest It only happens once every few hours of playtime so its more of a pleasant surprise than an immersivebreaking experience Finallythe achievements are more completionistbased and dont require millions of hours of playtime like the HD version play 1000 games as all empiresthank the godsso I want it treated right The Definitive Edition does it justiceand the helpful updates add so much value To those of you who love this game alreadysupport this version for as much money as you can spare To anyone who hasnt played Age of Empires II and is looking to startthis is a great opportunity to do so Take noticedevelopers THIS is how you update an old beloved classicI bought this as an homage to my fatherwho died of cancer on the rd of July this yearit was one of his favourite gamesand he played it for as long as I can remember From the point where I was old enough to play games I would be sitting on his lap as we used to challenge each other in games like AoECossacksDay of DefeatAmericas Army and Command  Conquerand while I still only have a measly 7 hours played on steam he had already played past a thousand hoursbut he had already passed for a few weeks at that point Its one of those things that slip past your mind and you later realize during the moment Cant explain how sad I was at the moment of realizationknowing my father wont get to play it himself But knowing him I am sure he wouldve loved it with these new graphics and settingsand would most likely yet again surpass over a thousand hoursthe improvements to the menu and graphics are very welcome The blur is a bit annoyingbut can be majorly fixed with the sharpendepth of fieldand antialiasing optionsor for my dad I just felt a urge to write this reviewto show how much this game meant to me and to my father for giving me so many good memories with himalthough most of them are not on the steam versionbut Ill be sure to play this a lot for you in your steadsince you are not able toand for introducing me to many great gamesdad Some of which are still my favouritesand most likely always will beWhen I was a kid I wasted my life away playing AOEII waiting to finish schoolIve played chess forever  Although I enjoyed games like Caesar IIII am very happy my adult kids talked me into playing AoE II with them  Its a blast  Im 6and its good for building new neural pathwaystooIm sure  So theres thatI highly recommend using the money you get from refunding Warcraft III Reforged to purchase this product insteadI have spent thousands of hours of my life playing many versions Age of Empires II No joke Check my hours counter for the HD edition in my library I grew up with playing Age of Kings with my friends in grade schoolprocrastinated with the HD edition through high schooland even spent Friday nights in college playing Arabia and CBA I know how the game probably better than any other video game And let me say this Microsoft has done a near flawless job of keeping the feel of the original game in the remakewhile managing to improve the game in almost every aspectbut are brought to new life with incredible vocalsroom filling soundand surprising depth as soon as you load up the game The music is clean and would fit in any modern game and yet it always stays rooted in the music you rememberthe game excels The devs definitely had a challenge here Playing the game requires you to be able to quickly identify buildingsunits and terrain at a glance This means that each building and unit on the field need their own graphical representation The graphics also had to be reminiscent of the old game to allow players to jump over without much trouble On top of all thismany of the civilizations have their own architecture styles Microsoft balanced this perfectly The units and buildings are fresh and look nice from a graphical point of viewbut are similar enough to the old game that there is no problem jumping from one version to the next A work from Microsoft herevvor 4v4 in deathmatch or random map and play a person your rank is huge Totally cuts down on the lobby system found in HD The lobby does stick around for those who want to play custom scenarios or play weird setting games with their friend The matchmaking mode tended to get me in a game in as little as  minutes Not super fastbut certainly serviceable Great system all aroundget caught on each other in big groupsand would generally bump into each other making life rough In DEthe pathfinding is at least slightly better in worst case scenario and in best case it flows smoothly and in a more impressive way There is still the odd villager who wanders out into the middle of nowherebut more often than notunits moveattackand respond much better to user inputsbut has good settings for both audio and videothis game is worth the 15 if you already own the gameand the 0 if you didnt The developers clearly worked their butts off to make this game spectacularA simple but detailed explanation of whyafter having played both versionsI prefer Definitive Edition DE instead of 01 Editionforcing you to either order your villagers to reseed themor to mash the queue reseed button in the mill In DEyou can set the mills to automatically reseedbut in the latterthe villager will move to build the last building you placed down If you order several buildingsthey will stop constructing the building theyre already working on to go build the new one In DE they will wait to finish the first building before starting on the next oneand to a lesser extentone team from another DEs graphics are much clearer so it is very easy to distinguish unit typeteamFAR more customizable than 01 Edition Not just with the settings graphicsUIand controls are much more changeable but especially with creating a gamenamely win conditionsstarting conditionsmap sizesunit restrictionsetc You can adjust many more settings to make a new game into whatever kind of scenario you want Also you can see what the map types actually look like in DEyou have to play hide and seek with each one to count themas well as less repetitive music Both games soundtracks are goodbut I find having the DE soundtrack playing in the background to be more enjoyable This point is pure preferencebut DEs graphics are significantly easier on the eyes and prettierTimelessbest way to spend quarantineIve bought this game more times than skyrim Improved command queue units start to execute the queue on the first click instead of waiting for a confirmationcan queue different types of commandsfor examplerushingdefending against rushesfast castlingplus new campaignsReading the reviews of this game remind me of my father as well He also used to be play this game so much before and after I was born My mother once complained to me that he was so keen on the game that she had to take care of me alone when I was still a baby When I grew a little olderI always spent the afternoon sitting next to him and watch him play this game and brag about his brilliant strategies He delved into the game so much just like any gamer today playing with friends in LAN or onlinereading the lengthy documents analyzing each civilizations traitschallenging the hardest AIs in 1v8s He likes to crash enemies using the French cavaliersand I probably watched him doing so hundreds of timeshe is now busy working and supporting the whole family in another city most of the time and hardly had any time for home and certainlyfor any games On very rare occasionshe comes back from workwalking into my room and asks what I am playing It is impossible for him to learn something new nowso I bought the 01 version for both of us He still picks France every timeusing the same strategies and brags about his skills whenever he wins a small battle Knowing that his play is actually quite outdated and slowI somehow still loves to watch him play for a few more hoursand cant wait to tell him the upgraded graphics version of this classic gameI believe a lot of people has so many memories stored in it Fathers and sonsbrothers and cousinschildhoods and youths For meit is part of my happy childhood for my fatherit is part of his wonderful youthi spent 0 on a game i already own so i wouldnt have to click the reseed farm button once every few minutesThe hours kind of speak for themselves at this pointThis is everything a remaster is supposed to be You remember playing this game over a decade agoand the graphics werent that bad But nostalgia is a cruel mistress You play the original againand you can barely stand itwhich was alrightplayable But thenthe real remasterthe Definitive Editionyou start playing the game and it FEELS like it used to feel Like it is supposed to look It is quite obviously way better than it used to bebut it FEELS the sameand want to play it againthis wont disappoint you Especially with the distinct lack of RTS games in the last decade or sothis still holds true as one of the best onesGrowing upI wasnt often allowed on the computer due to my own stubborn nature and daydreaming Howeverthe first time I saw this game as a free demo and I downloaded itI couldnt stop playing it I played the demo so much any chance I was allowed and even got my father to play too Wed sit and talk while I watched him play for hours Coming up with different strategies and joking about walling off the AIwhich we did Ofteneager to install and play it And play I did I remember playing the Aztec campaignsJoan of ArcSaladinrandom maps I couldnt get enough It was so much fundecades laterI have supported this franchise since that fateful day I just installed a demo I own almost all iterations of the franchise and do not plan to stop supporting it This game was my and manymany otherschildhood It helped me through a lot of very hard times through my life and to this dayI still enjoy just playing a random map or booting up the campaigns Ive played hundreds of times just to listen to the dialogue and the storytellingand it would be a disservice to not buy it and try it for yourself or even betterwith friendsTHIS IS HOW YOU REMASTER A GAME Age of Empires  was the game many of us grew up with and had endless hours of fun playing The 01 remaster was ok I guess but this one really brings it to 019 standards All the while keeping TRUE to what made it great in the first place That is an important point to remember for developers  innovate where necessary but dont remove stuff people like just because It is a hard balance to achieve but Microsoft has achieved it with this oneIve been playing this game for over  decades and Im happy to report that I still suck at multiplayerIm 67 yrs young This is one of the first games I played Ive always enjoyed itIf only Blizzard could have made Warcraft Reforged as well as Microsoft redid Age of Empires 
1,Im an old guy who has been playing computer games since the days of the BBC computer When I grew up in the late 1960s I liked reading classic science fiction  and playing Stellaris is like being immersed in one of those books James Blish or Isaac Asimov would have LOVED this gameI went in trying to build an enlightened utopia With blood and sweat I built a federationusing diplomacy and trade to scramble my way to the top despite warmongers all around me Then the Unbidden came My territory was overrundefenses were wiped outand my allies began to fracture But I held on Planet after planet was wiped out but I held onto my corebuilding up the mother of all fleets I lost upwards of 80 of my territory and my stockpiles of resources were nearly exhaustedbut I sent forth my fleet in a last glorious charge against inevitability I cut through tens of thousands of Unbidden shipsfleet after fleetuntil I arrived at the doorstep of the Dimensional Portal only to find that a rival empire had claimed a critical star system and closed their bordersblocking my path My resources were nearly exhaustedand my fleet was months away from crumbling under its own weight so there was no time to find a diplomatic solution I declared war Alasthe allies in my federation were too cowardly to provoke another power while they were still in the midst of pushing back the Unbidden so I had to make a hard decision I left the Federation that I had built and given everything to and declared war on my own As my new enemy scrambled and threatened to overrun what little I had leftmy fleet Last Hope pushed through the one troublesome system and then to the Dimensional Portal  the genesis of the Unbidden threat that had all but destroyed my civilization I gave the order and prayed Before I knew ituntold thousands of my people were dead floating in foreign spacebut the portal was destroyed It was over Not just the Unbidden threatbut my empire I had no wealthno territoryno federationand my shattered fleet was in no shape to fight a war on its own Then I saw it An achievement VictoriousBuy on sale Buy DLC on sale Sit down for a thousand hours and question how did it come to thisI dont care I just

found myself at odds with the influence and sector mechanics I was able to build a nice little empire with several allies in a federation Eventually building myself up to a real economic and military power With the help of my federation friends we were able to stop aggressive neighborsoverthrow a fallen empire and beat back interdimensional invaders More than once I found myself wishing for more

give out a review that tries to accomplish three thingsthe game is SUPER cheap on sales and you can pick it up then bOptionallyb if you have friends interested in 4x games or who currently own StellarisId recommend trying a multiplayer session in the gamespace is always better with friendsit comes super cheap when on sale due to it being older Adds a ton of fresh mechanics in the game that makes midgame more enjoyableDistant Stars is pretty on top of Leviathans I feel and adds a big amount of mechanics for EarlyMidgameyou can safely skip buying the DLCs all together and just do a multiplayer session with your buddy hosting Stellarislike other Paradox gamessupports DLC Sharing in Multiplayeras its the perfect size to be involved in most affairs and a good amount events have a fair chance to triggerwhich is about it really off the top of my head Also adds some new voice advisors which is niceit wont be as cheap on saletitansworld crackers and some other stuff It sounds cool but all of this stuff either has the chance of being cool or comes at a time where it isnt coolI would have put it above Apocalypse Prices MIGHT have changed for it on sale since its almost a year old now but dont know really It adds Megacorpationswhich are REALLY fun in multiplayer and fun in singleplayeralong with the Slave MarketSpace Vegas and other thingsId just avoid getting these Humanoid pack does add three new advisor voices and some new remixed music of other tracks thoughunless you REALLY love space spidersdont get it at allIve come to appreciate some of the changes or at least understand why they were changed for the better looking into previous versions of the game againyou could take WarpGateway travel for your starting form of travel instead of Hyperlane I felt the change to unifying it to just under Hyperlane was needed with the new Galaxy Generation and the encouragement of the new claim system It allows players not to worry about three different entry ways in their systems and just focus on oneyou wouldnt know what you had on the line and what needed to be done The newer system DEMANDS a goalgiving an idea for what you need to do to winnot lose Humilation War Dont take heavy losses Conquer Keep hold of the systems they demand Ideology War Planets are the most important thing to hold onto herebut I hoped I covered the big ones herewhich I was angry about a little but understood it later how getting a Precursor to spawn literally 20 years in game and anomalies were super easy to cheese and rushif there was anything else changed please do tell mejust need to manage two other pretty easy resourcesalloys are the thing that build ships nownot mineralswhile Consumer Goods are just spicy food tbh Both are exactly like energy from beforeyou run a bit low at first but some new planninggrowthtech shoots the production up and you sudden have excess This time you have a new galaxy market to sell your excess goods on Speaking of Spicy Foodfood itself was changed so its more than I just need 10005000 and I get the max amount of effectsnational plentitude is the new PopGrowth Boost and it drains your food more monthly Its a great change tbhthis is a monster I kinda wanted to die when I first saw trade routesI have to manage my ships to patrol constantly or I lose money It seems so overwhelming at firstbut youll eventually learn a great way to manage trade routes Youll be making sick profit AND training your admirals Patrols do this now outside of wartime real quickly Takes a few decades to get used to and everyone has their own creative methods to manage it wellwhat are these performance issues you mentionedh1ESPECIALLY at the launch of 22 The issues made the game nearly unplayable for the first couple weeks of Megacorps launch and took awhile to get going Eventually patches made performance pretty great for MediumLargewhich is honestly enough for the full meat of the game Recommend Huge only for multiplayer lobbies with good computer tbhI cant believe I didnt give Stellaris a review to this date Ill keep it short and sweetIMOa wellexecuted blend of 4X and Grand Strategy genres What really makes it shine is its exploration layerthe sheer volume of customization options and possibilities in its sandbox galaxy and emergent storytellingStellaris as a whole is hard to review The game itself is massive in scopeand over 880 hours at time of writing is hard to sum up in a characterlimited review Theres a meme for Hearts of Iron veterans where the Ive seen things you people wouldnt believe clip from Bladerunner plays while they recount their experiences Stellaris is the same way over 800 hours inand just when I think Ive seen it allsomething radically different pops up that shatters my expectations Ive seen startup empires get confined to 4 systems by mining drones surrounding them on 6 sides Ive seen AI suicide thousands of strength worth of fleets into a leviathansolely because they were too lazy to path around it Ive seen multiple federations formdisbandrecruit outcast members of the opposite sideand collapse again in a single playthrough Ive seen gas giants act as unofficial wormholesand fallen empires fully surrender after losing a single space battle Ive seen countless AI uprisings spawn in with more fleets than the entire Contingencyendgame crisis combinedonly to have them utterly collapse the next month from lack of economy Stellaris can be a symphony of discordbetrayaland stupidityand I love finding new ways to both break the gameand watch the game break itself I willhoweversay this Stellaris will not be for everyone It took me over 50 hours to secure my first winback in the early days of 19  20 Successful players will need a mix of patiencestubbornnessclever thinkingand extensive research via the wikiwhere you take a fledgling planet and turn it into a sprawling galactic empire or more likely die trying You control literally every aspect of your empire how your government is set upwhere your pops livehow theyre treatedwhat they researchwhat planets they colonizeand how you deal with the galaxy around you There are some automated aspects when it comes to ship design  planetsector managementbut these are almost always less efficient than playercontrolled choicesand thus are best given as little automation as possible With that saidtheres a massive amount of information constantly being thrown at the player throughout the gameeven enough to make veterans stumble from time to time The tutorial by itself is insufficient in preparing the player for the full burdens of managing an empire all on their ownespecially when dealing with the hidden interactions between traitsethics research specialtiesand thus an extensive reading of the wiki is highly recommendedand predictably unpredictable Everyone has different views regarding the AIwith personal skill and playstyle usually weighing heavily on their opinions From personal experiencethe AI can be compared to an earlymid tier playerdepending on difficulty modifiers They can utilize basic functionality like colonizing planetsutilizing relationshipstradingbuilding fleetsetcbut they tend to have glaring issues that can be exploited Specificallythey tend to have issues creating  maintaining their economyleaning more towards early gains for later lossesand panic spam specific structures when certain resources start running low At times theyll colonize planetsbut not properly construct infrastructure on them Ive never seen an AI build a titan or colossus that wasnt a Fallen Empire Theyre completely inflexible in terms of ship designfavouring point defense to a frankly ridiculous degreeand wont change their initial build based off external factors They also tend to build way over their fleet capand thus bankrupt themselves economically as time goes on And finallytheir relationships with others is extremely fickle at bestmaking  break rivalriesalliancesnonaggression pacts constantly With that saiddifficulty modifiers giving passive economic  research buffs can help even the scales with them The old problems still exist with thembut are less damning Grand Admiral difficulty can absolutely wreck all but the strongest buildsand a mega federation can easily end a gameno matter how strong you are Make no mistakethere will always be a challenging difficulty for all players With that saidits perfectly acceptable to find and stop at one that you find both challenging  enjoyable For meits a 200250 scaling Admiral game on a small galaxywith 025 planet spawns and 05 hyperlane density Your mileage may varyas there are muchmuch bigger galaxy sizes to choose from provided you have the time  energy to complete themuseless early techs like energy siphonthe varied usability of missiles  the complete brokenness of strike craftand a host of visual  gameplay issues existed even when I was playing at the end of 19and still do to this day The problem is that the devs seem to live in their own worldand think that constantly reworking everything will somehow nullify old gameplay issuesespecially when it comes to balance decisions Like for examplestrike craft have been broken for a long time nowbecause their AI is scatterbrained and they fly too far from combat to be of any use But instead of just fixing their AIthe devs are planning to repurpose starportbased strike craft to instead guard trade routes This is nicebut doesnt change the fact that they still target incorrectly and continue to be useless for mobile carriers Similarlythe tile system is to be replaced entirelyto try and fix the AIs colonizing issues and the sector managers overall efficiency flawsbut this doesnt change the fact that both are still awful at managing their economies as a whole This is perhaps my biggest issue with Stellarisand Paradox in general they seldom fix anything that requires more than changing one or two lines of codeand instead seem to think that reworking everything is preferable to just fixing whats already there Theres an unreal amount of oldbusted relics from previous patches left in the gamestill as broken as the day they were introducedbut left ignored by a company that refuses to take a couple months off from developing new cosmetic DLC and simply fix what already existsand I wouldnt have sunk almost 900 hours into it if I didnt enjoy it But the last few months of minor changes and planned reworks havent given me much hope for Paradoxs vision of the future Thus Ill reemphasize that Stellaris requires a lot of determinationand a bit of thick headednessin order to fully learn how to play it and circumvent the remaining bugsgameplay imbalances I very much enjoy the gameits teachings about basic philosophies  politicsand the stories Ive created over the dozens of empires Ive built  destroyed But I have to admit I laughed at the 19ers who complained that 20 was ruining the game theyd come to loveas I thought 19 was a broken mess and that 20s changes were all right on the money But after 880 hours learning 2022 now imminently looms on the horizonthreatening to vastly change the games economy  take away a large portion of player control via the tile system removal and I cant help but feel a little anxious about the future This is perhaps the biggest surprise that Stellaris has given me the fact that I now feel so much sympathy for the 19ersand worth your time to learn if youre determined enough But I personally will be waiting on the sidelines with cautious optimismhoping for the best with 22 but preparing for the worstEdit As of writing this reviewI have 20 hours logged in Stellaris  Stellaris has been out for 29 hourshappy people dont  I dont want rebellionsthose make people even more unhappy  If I took Spiritualist Id get a nice 5 bonus to happiness  Even betterif I grabbed Fanatic Spiritualist Id get a whopping 10 bonus to happiness and wouldnt have to worry about rebellions everwhich adds 5 happinessand the charismatic traitwhich gives everyone on a planet a 1 happiness bonus for every member of my race on that same planetnational ethicsand even my form of governmentI was able to get a total 25 boost to my happiness  I ended up as a fanatically spiritualpacifistic race of charming people who just like getting along with everyone  To top it offI found the most fitting racial portrait  a classic grey alienthe kind you see in all of those old movies and tv clips about Alien abductions  Classic graysbut with a bigdoofy grin slapped permanently across their facesso I was stuck surrounded in a sea of AI  It didnt matter what I didmy people remained happy  I manipulated my neighbors and pitted them against each other for my own gain  I created a superalliance with my angry fungus neighbors and invaded the birds who were restricting my movementdistributing them across my empire while stripping away their power and influence even on their homeworld  I shipped them across my empirebalancing them with my own grinning populace across the empire  we live on the same kind of worldafter allso happywho hadnt achieved spaceflight yet  I set up a research post and began lightly observing them  Thenof courseI began the process of bringing them up to speed with the rest of the galactic communitynow  My friends are politicking on the other side of the galaxymaking and breaking alliances in power struggles that send ripples far enough that Ive seen their effects over in my corner of the galaxywhere Ive spent my time well  genetically modifying the subjugated aliens of my empire to be happyjust like usI have been awake for 40 hours and its finals weekfinding several of my friends  MeanwhileI enlightened 2 more species and was working on a rd when we saved and quit  They were fully integrated into my empire very quickly but we only bothered to modify one of themas the other was naturally happythe angry fungusand I all immediately set about molding our corner of the galaxys nations to mirror our own by invading them and liberating all of their planets under new governments we set up to be more sympathetic to our ethicsmoaningand there was much gnashing of teeth as they were slowly ground down by a nonplayer Empire that was consistently thrashing their armies untilafter 15 years of warthey managed to research better shield systems to counter their powerful lasers and turn the tide of the war and secure them a white peacetook one planetliberated another under its own new governmentand vassalized himAs a new player to StellarisI have no historical perspective to complain about changes Games like these are not normally ones I play That being saidI very much enjoyed playing this game I appreciate that I can pause the game in single player and take the time to set actions for everything before unpausing The anomolies are fun to explore Awakened empires were a pain in the beginning because the game doesnt warn you that out of a 200 year gamean empire will awaken within the last 0 years to absolutely dominate and ruin your game if youre not prepared A warning or heads up for that would have been nice I do wish the 10 DLCs were not so expensive per piece Im not convinced to buy them unless they go on saleI love Stellaris and think its an amazing space strategy game The dlcs add amazing content to the game that always makes me come back and play a couple hundreds hour more The game isnt perfect and it has some flaws that you should know aboutthe engine is pretty bad since you can be running the best cpu and gpu known to man and the game will lag like crazy during the endgame forcing you to play on the smaller galaxiesthe Ai is kinda trash forcing you to mostly use mods to make them more entertaining and a force to be reckoned withplanetsbackground look 5 times better to making the Ai better to helping you create your faction and adding more events to keep you entertain during midgame Trust me you will want some mods for this gamePlay as a Reptile raceYou dont actually winyou just get bored and try again with a different set upThis is the story

1,Soand just got my Pen blackstar Whats not to recommendfrom the economy through to the relative silver rates for craftinggrindingand everything except huntingis mathematicallybalanced to a genius level degree The worldquestsand classes have an amazing degree of depththrough to the constant shower of microrewards need to login 27 gamblingbased enhancement and exponential sunkcostthis is a game designed to exploit your every weakness to take out your credit cardI think the same applies to this game And much like drugsyoull probably do better if you dont try them in the first placeSowhere to even begin I guess the most important thing here is that this is certainly not the MMO for everybody This MMO manages to pack in something for every kind of player out therebut that actually doesnt mean it will appeal to everyoneIll cover the topic of the pricepointsince in the very most lenient sense hereits variablenothing Thats pretty handy The price point is at least low enough that for most peopleeven if they dont like the gamethey wont have lost out on much Nowchances arethe price point is that low because THERE ARE MICROTRANSACTIONSIF YOU WANT THEM Im putting this at the beginning of the review because I know that this will either immediately deter peopleor encourage them to hear me out on this The best way I saw these described was as conveniences You can get items that rival the cash shop itemsbut it will take timeand it will take effort Butthere is nothing to stop someone from simply getting a headstart on the game by dropping a little extra money on the game Is that bad Wellat a 10 initial price pointI dont think sobecause almost all of the cash shop items are convenience itemsie streamlining workersgetting a nicer boat without investing time into itgetting gear to speed up fishing initiallyetc The game counteracts this by allowing a lot of things to be completed AFKsuch as fishingor even autolooping a running path to level up your stamina seriouslyyou can just have your character run infinitely between two points and get levels out of itI cant make this up Need to level your mount Check the auto feed optionstock up on carrotsset an autoloopand go sleep or do productive things while your character travels between points A and B and your horse learns new skills So honestlythe cash shop items are certainly a thing which most people would look down onbut I havent even seen the need for them That saidI could have higher tolerance for grinding see my Maplestory hourslets not talk about iton the topic of grindingthis IS a korean MMOand its gonna involve a lot of grinding The AFK system is honestly a godsendIm telling you Howeverthe combat is very dynamic and frankly the best Ive ever seen in an MMO it does seem very similar to TERAbut definitely more rewarding and satisfying For skills grindinga fair amount of it can be done while tabbed outso the grindy feeling there is alleviated to a fair extentthis game does a very good job of letting you choose your own playstyle Want to make it to the second town and then level all the way to 55 and make millions by fishing Surego ahead Want to immediately start a farm and create a monopoly on food goods in the player marketplace That works too Set up trade routes between nodes and make all your money and experience through buying low and selling highit doesnt matteryou get rewarded with level exp for so many things in this gameyou can choose how you want to play the game You can even treat it almost as a singleplayer game with the Black Spirit quest lineso play how you want to And heyif youre still into the killquest style MMOthats all here for you tooand you wont even have to touch the other skills Its relieving to play an MMO that lets you decide how you want to play itwhich entails warring over territories or capturing areas to claim tax to pay guild members and such I dont know too much about thisbut from what Ive viewedit seems incredible to wage alloutwar with other guilds for essentially control over money The PvP seems to be a big part of this gameand Im hoping to make it to that endgame experience soon And yesbefore you askthese wars DO entail fortscannonsarmiesetcwhich just seems super awesome Other guilds though seem to take the game casuallyand only want a community to play withso thats diversified as wellthe combat is fluid and feels OH SO GOODand the AFK feature is even enhanced by an option to minimize the game to the tray The chat is very spammy with system notifications when you first join the gamebut the settings menus help with all that and it should take you just a couple trialanderrors to figure out what you do want to see broadcast and what you dont want to see The quest handling is nice and will even autopath you to destinationsand despite minor environmental hookups I got stuck on a staircase once its a very reliable system and can streamline the early gameso after all of thiswhy cant I recommend it to everyone I meanIm giving it a thumbs upam I not Wellits because there is very little explained to you in this gameand thats probably because if they didyou wouldnt ever end the tutorial The game has so much complexity to it that youre going to want to have YouTube openwhatever databases or guides you can finda friend on skypereally anything to help you understand a new part of the game youve decided to dabble in For somethats incredibly daunting and I cant say everyone would enjoy the game based on this aspect And this isnt me saying GO BACK TO YOUR BABY MMOS YA BABIES I mean seriouslythis game is a lot to take in and Im surprised even I can handle it While I believe you can take the game in any way you likeyou still might get curious one day and find a whole new aspect to the game that doesnt suit your fancyor its just so horrifically complicated at first that you arent going to understand it until your 15th fail stack Now personallyI dont mind having to research an aspect of a gameand I even personally have a journal where I jot down notes for all sorts of games I play Im a huge nerdI know this But some people want to hop in and just play to endgamewhich is okay Having to find and research your way to the endgame isnt always funand I understand thatmy final verdict is this if any of this sounded appealing to yougive it a shot Given that it casts its net very wideyou can probably find something youd enjoy in this game Butbe prepared to do some researchas some of the time youre just going to be confusedno matter how much experience you have with MMOs or ingame economies If the mention of a cash shop that DOES benefit players deterred you entirelythenah wellthats fairand Id even encourage you to look elsewhere Despite it being solely convenience itemsI cant dispute the fact that they do exactly that And finallyif all of this sounded appealing to youI almost plead with you to play thisas I ended up finding the MMO I was looking forand I hope you do toI realized I totally forgot to mention that the Black Desert Online site DOES ALLOW A 7DAY TRIAL Please notethe account used for that trial and the account used in Steam CANNOT BE LINKEDbut this is a way for you to try the game and see if you like it If the 10 or the cash shop is concerninggive the trial a chance and seeand then decide what medium you would want to purchase it on Id recommend using the trial and then coming to steam to start anew and know what direction you want to pursuebut please keep this in mind Hope this helpsLOOK AT MY HOURS PLAYED I waited 15 months to write a review Ive pretty much done it all Im running around at softcap with pretty much all content acquired This game IS damn amazing Today2th of August 2018they made the game truly pay to win Im not talking added a ghillie suit to the cash shop or anything like thatI mean fullblown swipe your credit card to become stronger than anyone who put effort into the game or is skilled at pvp If you as a gamervalue skill and talent over who has richer parents than for the love of god stay away There is so much more fun to be had elsewhere This game is officially dead with this change I urge all players to leave a negative review to alert people who may fall for this scamgamebut you should try not to forget the developers Pearl Abyss and the Publisher Kakao Games as we certainly will see them again in the future to further scam their playerbase once again If there is any comment you read about BDO that you pay attention to its this one DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIMEMONEYI have now 56605 hours on this account besides this I have a Beta account that I played on when the game came out Aka let me tell you about the game that will make you lose your mind in multiple waystravelingfollowing a storyquesting and lifeskilling you will be drawn to this game from the get go Also you can drop all your ideas of your perfect EGirl in the character designYou need to understand three things about this gamebutits a glorified interactive casino Everything in this game is RNG dependantthis game is extremely addicting At first it may not be apparentbutif youre running a beefy PC your electric bill will inform you that this game is consuming your lifethis game has the potential to be extremely expensive or extremely cheap while providing the same level of fun  The Pay to Win aspect of this game solely exists in the form of convenience It is 100 impossible for you to spend 100000 an expect to be the best geared player in the game That saidit is 100 POSSIBLE for you to spend 100000 and feel like you still need to spend moreroughly 150 in order to have enough pets for autolootingcarry weightand inventory space Howeverif youre not a hard core player the  pets you get from questing and the additional 1 pet 5 total you eventually get from your login bonus are more than adequate to keep up with most peoples grind habits The additional inventory slots you get from questing are also more than adequate for most people Additionallyas a new player you receive several free Value Packsif you focus your first month of the game on learning and gearing up you will easily find yourself having an income high enough to purchase a new value pack every month with ingame currency In the event that you are a little slower on the uptakeyou could join any guild that offers 5m silver  day daily pay and push all of that money into a city storage you dont often visit Thenat the end of the monthyou will find that your guild has effectively paid for your value packthenyour entry fee is closer to the ball park of 150250 depending on your Luck with obtaining Tier  petswhich is a gambling process involving purchasing multiple of the same type of pet and combining them for a chance at increasing their Tier Youre also going to want as many character slots as you can so that you 1 camp every boss site2 have a dailyweekly life skill character at each major resource hotspotand 3 increase your family fame fund daily silver awarded to you at login As a Hard Core player youre also going to keep your Silver focused on obtaining stronger  better gear so youll have a recurring payment of 15mo 590day Value Pack and an additional 25mo for Blessing of Kamasylve increases drop rate The Kamasylve cost is mitigated by events where they give 715 day kamas out like candy so you can think of this in annual terms at about 150year As a Hard Core player you also will want tolater onprotect your TET and PEN enhancements using Cron stones If youre lucky enough to be in a siege or node warring guild you might already have enough SILVER to buy Cron stones Howeveronly about 20 of players fall into this category For everyone else theres Master Card Reach into that wallet and spend roughly 68 on Costumes to extract Cron stones from PER ATTEMPT Remember what we said about gambling You can absolutely spend a million dollars here and never get any furtherdepending on your definition of Pay to Win But consider the following if youre not a hard core player then you probably arent ever going to bother with high level enhancing This means if you decide to get stronger youre probably going to spend ingame currency Mister Mastercard might spend  10000 on his first PEN item Youre going to spend about 17 billion silver on your first PEN Most casual players at end game can rack in 00800mweek which means you will see that PEN in about 28 weeks Most Pay 2 Win type of people are not wealthy enough to drop 360week into a video game Do they exist Surebutyou have the same chance of meeting Clint Eastwood in Japan as you do of meeting one of those players At this stage in the gamewho is to say the person you run into isnt just someone who has played since launch  Point isits not going to affect your experience on way or the otherof the bestof the best Grinding is for peasantsyou want to make all of your money and obtain all your gear without even leaving Velia Bad newsbud This isnt the game for you The number of Pearl items you can sell is directly affected by the number of characters you have at level cap If you only get 1 character to level 60 before you decide youre going to be a wallet warrioryoure only able to sell 10 Pearl Items  week That means you are hardcapped at 335 billion silver  week on money Your first PEN item is going to take you a minimum of 5 weeks to pay with cash BUT WAIT Theres more As of writing this post there have only ever been 121 PEN Kzarka Blades sold on the central market place Meaningeven if you have the silver you are still relying on the rest of the community to make the itemso what Youll just Master Card your way through the TET and PEN attempts Wellwe know of at least 1 player on the NA server who hasso farfailed 85 times in a row on safe TET attempts But lets say you dont have the worst lucklets say you have fairly average luck You are going to attempt about 8 times for TET and about 20 times for PEN If all of these are going to be safe attempts thats 1360 for your PEN after you spend 20 on your TET For simplicity sake lets call it 1500 per PEN this will see you at 10500 for PEN Armor and Weapons BUT WAIT THERES MOREor break without crons Lets be generous and say you have average luckyoure using cronsits all pay 2 winand well call it a conservative 2000 per PEN accessory Thats an added 6the cost of outright pay 2 win in this game is a paltry 16000 for the gear BUT DONT STOP THERE  Did you think having full PEN would make you formidable in the game HA You still need your Dream Horse  Lets be generous with that too and tack on another 2000 BUT WAIT THERES MORE You need a Frigate And your Frigate has to be the best of the best of the best  Lets call it 1000 per piece of gear to hit 10 frigate equivelant of PEN and ignore the cost of actually buying blue gear So theres another 000 So now were at 21000 to pay to win the gameyou fall to nobody So you swipe your card  only to find that every single item required to make that ship can only be obtained through Bartering A long process that requires your physical laborguy You have to grind Because unless you are level 62 you arent scary even with full PEN The cost to make you a God amongst players your same level without lifting a finger 1020000 USD The cost to make you useful in a siege or node war Pricelesswould take a minimum of 65 weeksand the margin between you and the NonP2W player after 65 weeks will be negligibleThis game is beautiful and Fun for a couple hundred hours but that you might aswell not botherdungeons or anything of the sort   All content updates are essentially new places to grind your life awayhowever  the Devs are disconnected from the player base and seem more preoccupied with adding pay to win items and remastering the already beautiful graphicsinstead of adding worthwhile content for PvEand making progression smoother  or actually possible  without spending hundreds of insert your currency here to get the slightest upgrade i also forgot to mention how to make any decent amount of money you have to Afk grind professions Try having your computer running the entire month Food  who needs that Electricity bills will be 1 priorityIm not saying the game is P2WBlack Desert Online is a fantastic idea and world settingthe combat is immersive with a high skill capthe character creation is the best of any game released to dateits enhancing system is horrid while still being extremely unique and what keeps people playingand the game looks absolutely stunning with a welcoming communitywhile the enhancing system FEELS extremely rewarding when an enhancement succeeds you still end up losing millions on that enhancement The games accessories break when an enhancement is failed unless cron stones are used Well cover these later This means that if you have a boss gear accessory that is Tri18 and attempt to go to tet19 and your enhancement fails youve potentially lost BILLIONS of silver The same applies to weapons but usually its just hundreds of millions not billionsUnless were discussing a pen20 attempt This will allow us to discuss the next topic THE GRINDPearl itemsthis means investing losts of money into the game about 200 for mob grinders and 00600 for lifeskillers All these items are pay for convenienceKakao makes its game unbearable without these pearl shop items A must for all players is Petsat least tier 2 for all of themabout 6080 Pets are absolutely necessary to your success in this gamethey will loot items for you as well as give you boosts to certain xp values or knowledge gain chance Lifeskillersyoure going to have to spend money on at least one pearl shop costume that are NOT able to be listed on the marketplace for silver These costumes run about 22 USD and are essential for lifeskillers This game is pay to win when it comes to maintaining a higher skill score Outfit setscosmetic items that boost xp stats that are a pearl shop item BUT can be purchased from the marketplace using precious silver that could be going to enhancing Can be melted down for CRON stones Cron stones protect the enhancement level on an item from dropping on a failed enhancement chance or prevent an accessory from breaking on a failed enhancement Which meansspending IRL money will save you potentially BILLIONS of silver that can be used to enhance other gear Another ptw item from the item shop is Artisans memories What these do is they make an item restore x their value on a repair Meaning someone that spends money on these spends x less on repair materials for their boss gear which is extremely substantialit is essentially having a second job and sinking every waking moment into this game if you have plans to progressI can not recommend this game to the average gamer despite how much I enjoy it The enhancing system is this games downfall and its risethe pay to win is too much handle if youre a ftp player and Kakao is a greedy company out for that dough If you like grind maybe this game is for youIm okay with the grind but find myself taking breaks lasting for a few months before picking the game up again But if you dontDo not purchase this gameIm not saying this game is P2WPROShands downfocusing on killing enemies instead of lvling uprealisticoriginalgearand other things you find useful in your journeymaking you feel like the Pay2Win claim is quite a bit underminedi find a game where i actually have great use of renting armor Its more or less free as wellas you get back the contribution points you spent on renting the armor when returning it This system is great and beginners like myself should take great advantage of itbut focus on the cutscenes and the shadowy companion Watching him grow and transform is really excitingand it makes you want to keep going just to see how far does this little guy really golots of fun topics and trash talkdiscussionshelpand otherbut its very easy to list your own items and quickly gain currency to buy yourself new equipmentwhile the really good items have their strong values for the hardcore peopleWoW being first with FFXIV following just afterand then comes either this game or Runescape Should tell you why so many people play italthough can be hard to navigatehas about everything you could need if you cant find something otherwiseyou have a hotbar I recommend learning the basic abilities while putting the more complexperformed abilities on the hotbaras well as utilities like the horse flute if youve got an explorers package and health potionsthen monsters get progressively tankier up untill 0where they start to get slightly more difficult Up at 50 youre likely to die quite a few times if youre not paying attention to your health Monsters get much tankier and do harsh damage This is not really a conbut this curve is rather quick and can take you by surpriseit doesnt appear to be much connection in terms of doing activities together Its focused on yourself and your journey is going the much like a singleplayer experiencebut the world is still filled with life Guilds and PvPas well as wars is where the game shines and brings you out of the lonely wanderingwhich rarely a standard gaming rig can handleclasses tend to be unbalanced in PvP and 1v1s are rarely a fair matchupsuch as your horse is in the stable in the town you left it at000 metres awayor your good weapon you couldnt equip at the time is a 15minute walk away because you had put it in the storage in some city you probably cant even rememberthere is a lot of nonenglish speaking people in the global chats Primarily GermansDutchand Polishas well as Frenchavoiding global channels from being spammedbut it can be frustrating because theres lots of great memes and conversations you might want to take part inbut you have to make the decision between chilling over there or saving your energy for lifeskills or conversing with NPCsmost probably due to an attempt to stop global chats from spamming WTBWTSalthough it still happensone thing it gives you early on is a 7day Value Pack Its greatreallybut the problem is that this is a marketing strategy in order to get you used to having the benefits of the pack straight off the batso once it actually depletes you feel like youre playing at a disadvantage when in reality youre playing vanilla Its an attempt at making you want to subscribe for the value pack If you can see past thisthen it is only more power to you because you get a 7day Value Pack free Additionallyit also gives you an idea of what the Value Pack offerswhich might be problematic for somebecause the character i play is not even the same gender so how would i personalize it to my liking to get myself in to the world I forgot to mention that some classes have a malefemale equivalentsuch as the Kunoichi being a female version of the Ninja However Kunoichi still differentiates at lvl 56 with the awakeninggetting a chakram instead of a katan and turns more AoEbased and ranged While most clases have a gender equivalentthey still do differ just a tad bitreally do need pets and potentially weight efficiency People saying you can buy pearls off the market or pets are kind of  kind of not wrongbecause the problem isnt that you wont be able to afford itthe problem is that everyone has the money for itmeaning as soon as it shows up on the marketits gone in an instantmaking it very hard to actually buy cash shop items for ingame currencythe amount of hoursvsprice youll be paying is highly likely to be worth it Game is flawed and can feel like its not a full experience just because of how ridiculously huge it is and all the activities to do Feels like youre basically never going to finishas well as the cash shop makes you feel like you miss out and waste time because youre not paying to have efficiencybut if you pay attentionit really is much more original and not just Ugh greatits that forest area like in all other MMOs I usually hate forests in MMOsthey tend to be the most generic and standard template out therebut it reallyreally feels original here I cant stress that enough There is a ton of beautiful areas you can just sit down and breathe in for a bitbut i dont have enough spacethe review has reached its capFirst thing is firstI am recommending this game but I caution you to make an informed decision with information listed belowin that this MMO focuses almost entirely on PvP combat and due to this the entire combat system feels very unique  Instead of quickslotting abilitiesBDO has a combo system where key combinations cast your abilities  Learning your class is essential and will have many different learning curves and way of playing  Rotating cooldown timers is an important part of it for surebut it certainly makes the combat in this game feel better than other MMO titles  For this reason I would say one of the main reasons I would pick this title over others is the combatand puts many people off  Enhancing gear has a percentage chance to failwhich gets larger as the gear gets better  If you fail an enhancementthe max durability of an item goes down and the only way to repair it is to get a base durability item and use it as a repair material  This only gets more expensive when you acquire the best in slot equipment  Additionallyonce you get to the last  enhancement levels on a piece of gear each fail will revert the enhancement level back a step  Players have come up with systems to increase the oddsbut it is always a gamble  Most players will choose to save their resources and buy gear rather than go through the tedious process of enhancing  Failing higher level enhancements is extremely taxing to a players financesbut rather a soft cap where obtaining exp becomes so difficult that the next level is near impossible to reach  As more players reach these higher levels the cap is raised and as such the gap between new players and old players increases  The game managers have come up with clever events to try and close this gap and this works to varying extentsor workingwhatever the case is  Now look if you have the money for the electricity thats fine and all but not everybody does  It is important to note that these inactive gains add up over time and can give you an edge over players who do not follow suitbut there is no way to trade items between players  This isnt exclusive to guilds either  Any items you have that you may even want to sell to your friendyou cant do so for a lower rate  All player transactions go through an auction housewhich means that there is always a chance the item gets snagged before your friends can buy from you  I think the idea that guilds cannot share resources between members is a really dumb idea  I understand why they do thisbut it is quite a change from other MMOsand it was all uncharted territory  Progression felt rewarding because once I was strong enough I could hold my ownor maybe even win open world PvP encounters  This was the case for a whilebut eventually the bar was raisedand winning fights was no longer an option for me  The answer to this was grinding and pushing to have my gear enhanced but it just became a Skinner box of a video gamebut if youre looking for attainable PvE content go somewhere else  There are very few PvE options available in the end gamebut very few players reach the level at which these areas can be cleared  This game is for those who like to PvPand I cannot in good faith recommend this to players who want to crawl dungeons as there arent really any dungeons to crawlThis is a good game to play for about as long as I did Spend the minimum amount of money to have a fun experience for about 30 days and play until you hit your awakening and when pvp unlocksthen stop Theres nothing new after that except grinding Dont even worry about trying to make your gear better or getting pets or anything like that as its just a ploy to get you to spend obscene amounts of money and time for a small return Simply enjoy the game as a singleplayer story for about 80 hours and then make a new class to see different combat or move onIm not saying the game is P2WIf you look at the amount of time and entertainment you get for the priceok its worthits an mmo and grindy but you still have fun getting strongers making friends etcbut there comes a time for everyone to know when to put it downNote to considering buyersthe 10 price tag is false youll probably need to end up spending probably another 20 or so to feel like youre not being hindered in terms of bag spaceweightor auto loot speed This game is an extremely long term gamethere are no gear resets when new content dropsthen this game isnt for you But the flip side of that though is thisthe progression is always there Concerning the length howeverthey did add seasonal servers which slingshot new players to a spot where they can actually start working towards end game gear When this game first came outyou had to go RagstoRiches all by your lonesomebut now its really not the caseIve heard that they have made ways to get around itbut I personally havent reached that pointbut I have been getting some of said items needed to bypass the RNGit most definetly is possible BUT it isin my opiniona complete waste of money due to how inefficient it is Though players most certainly canand a small minority dobuy cash shop items and sell them for ingame moneyyou would probably need to spend no less than 10000 USD to get anything close to endgame gear from 0 So yeahwhales can existbut you likely wont encounter them and they make it so we dont need to pay a subscription to keep the servers runninglove being able to play by yourself for highend contenthaving the option for group PvPand love complicated systemsthis game is likely gonna be a good fitendgame content requiring groupsor systems that can be learned within a relatively short time spanthis may not be the game for you This isnt to trash anyone who fits in this category thoughI really want to emphasize that everyone just has fun in a different way I have over 3000 hours in this game since early beta and while it is one of my favourite MMOs it has major issues that unless fixed  ruin the gamemore nodes without the encumbarance on your contribution

good or bad the game is It is about the difference between Steam version and Standalone version If you try it on steam and later decide to invest time and money into this gameyou will discover that steam players will be missing out on many promotions and freebies Not game breaking but frustratingYesyes Is it bad yes Is it good yes Is it p2w yes can i not pay yes Will i waste hatefully 5k hours on this game yes Will i enjoy it yes Am i stupid yesI have spent about 110 hours in Black Desert Online as of this reviewnot grinding mobs or testing my combat against other playersbut in life skilling and questing Even with the inclusion of builtin tutorial videosvery little in Black Desert Online apart from combat is explained wellthus leading to frequent trips out of the game to learn

1,I think most of the people who write reviews for this game would back me up on this PLEASE make a full game based on the rougelike mechanics of the first third of the gamemaybe making different selectable hosts with their own boards and rulesor maybe just combining them all to make an endless Inscryption rougelike Im in love with the story they created and the card game they put passion into I just want them to expand on itcould turn into the best card game since YuGiOh or Magic The GatheringThe only bad thing about Inscryption is that you can only play it for the first time onceI really wanted that pirate battleI played the entire game through in one 10hour sitting and still wanted more when the credits rolledbut I knew I had to give this game one The game keeps throwing new twists and turns at you the whole way throughproviding a funevolving gameplay experience AND a funevolving storythe less you know the better the game isThis game is just pure amazing I just wish that this become an actual card game like roguelike or endless mode I know the point of this game is to focus on the story but the card gameplay was so much fun and thoughtprovoking I would gladly buy it as a dlcIt is not the classic card game Mullins has once again managed to bring variety to the gameGo in as blind as possibledont look anything up and accept the twists and turnsWhile I did love this gameit is not a card game roguelike like the trailers for the game gave offits a game trying to tell a story with card game elementsI would look elsewhere seeing as this game pretty much ends after 1012 hours and the story comes to a conclusion and doesnt have a ton of replay value outside of finding secrets or you really enjoyed the gameplay loopbut this one does give a gameplay loop that has some semblance of replay value if not a ton with the card gameInscyption is a palette cleanserWorst part of this game is when its over Definitely worth the price tagexcellent experience which I hope gets a spiritual successor or a sequelif you actively put effort into getting immersed in the audio youll be rewarded with an unrivalled experienceb Sacrifices must be made…bwrapped up in a turn based deckbuilding card game roguelike  If that sounds like a lot to swallowdon’t worry……It isbut the game does a fantastic job of scaffolding you up and taking it one step at a time  You won’t get very far until you really know what you are doingwellit’s a Dan Mullins game and secrets and twists in story is kind of his thing  i see Pony Island and The Hexigiving further variations with new cards and mechanics listof course  Finding secretsbreaking things and outclassing the NPCs is key if you want to survive and solve the mystery  I love this about these kinds of games that sway in and out of realitybreaking the 4th wall occasionally and leaving you a bit spooked that someone might be actually watching you listsolve puzzles  Get up from the card game to walk aroundsolve other puzzles  Watch an FMV and pause it at the right moment……puzzle  What about this seemingly uninteresting piece of furniture  Yepit’s a puzzle  Depending on how deep you want to delve into what the game has to offerthe main story line puzzles range from easy as sacrificing a squirrel for a Stoatall the way up to some real headscratchers  But if you want to really discover the secrets behind the curtain you are going to have to get your Discord hat on and join the group to add your brain to the think tank listwe have an extremely dark storypsychologically and even visually from time to time  There is plenty of explicit storytelling but also a lot of things you might need to fill in the gaps on if that’s your kind of thing too listtaking part in the ARGs and watching Youtube videos I will never really fully understand this game or at the very least see everything that it has to offer  I wish I had the time to delve into every little facet of the game and discover it all for myself but I don’t  And this makes me sad listJim”  As a gameInscryption works very well but as a card game it won’t really have the draw to keep you coming back for more in that aspect  There are no new cards to unlock after the credits  There is no PvP aspectwhich is such a shame because it would be amazing to build your own cards and play against other people online  So at the end of the day Inscryption is a clever video game with some well thought out card game shell around it  listdo yourself a favour…don’t watchread or even glance at anything else related to the game and just grab a squirrela knife and a pair of pliers and sit down at the table with your deckMullins continues his trend of not revealing very large portions of the game in the store pageInscryption is a game that both impressed and disappointed me When I played the demo I was so excited for the full game I preordered it which I dont do alot on steam and booted it up as soon as I could What the demo did promise was ultimately delivered There is a funroguelike card game that makes you think about every card you playwhere you play itand when you play it I loved the art style and creepy atmosphere Im a big Binding of Isaac fan and the fact that it was a roguelike where you start again just a little more powerful made me so excited to play it for possibly hundreds of hours Inscryption is unfortunately not that kind of gameThere is nothing to be gained from subsequent playthroughs in terms of deckbuilding or improving your characters stats The story being told is the main reason to play and once youve seen the story to the creditsthats it No real reason to play again other than to experience the story after youve forgotten what happens With that being said I still really enjoyed my roughly 1213 hour experience There was alot of surprises and things happening to keep you wanting to continue to see what happens next I hope they come out with a spinoff where its basically the same card game but it focuses more on replayabilty like in the demo and the expand the gameplay further from thereI thought this was going to be just another card game with a creepy settingbut it turned out to be so much more Could not stop playing once I got past the first third of the game and also couldnt stop smiling I really dont want to say too much because its a game that deserves to not be spoiled EnjoyWhat started off as a simpleyet spooky deckbuilding game quickly transforms into so much more Its clever surprisesand twists and turns in both the narrative and the gameplaykept me engaged and delighted the whole way through As long as you approach this game with an open mindyou should have a great time with this excellent gem of a video gameHoly shit Dont look anything up or watch anyone play this before experiencing it for yourself This is one of the most memorable games I have ever playedOne of those must play games Unbelievably well doneI have not had the motivation to finish a game for 3 years

1,I like playing cities alot I have Cerebral Palsy and use a HeadMouse to work the computer  Its one of the few games that will work with my HeadMouse Its hard finding games that I can play because I dont have use of my hands I would recomme it to anyone with a disabilityThis is an outstanding game This is an exceptionally outstanding citybuilder gamein a genre that for too longhas been deeply troubled with overcasualizationpoor optimizationillthought out conceptsmicrotransactionsand general publisher shenangansand zooming out to broadly appreciate my traffic networkand those were reflected in the game As an exampleI assumed people would use a variety of methods to get to work hop on the metrothen take a busWhen I tracked peoplethey would do thisyou build a dam  the water level raises People go to the store People go to work The water gets dirty from pollution I get a sense that the city is a living and breathing entity  it gives me context to the experienceFocused Construction You place roads and zones freelyfocused around the placement of the roads The zones are indelibly linked to this It was a great design decision and simplifies the more annoying aspects of construction It also makes the transport very obvious as one of the key aspects of the game000 peoplebut the listed population is only 0its almost impossible to make angles of a similar basis repeatedlyat least at the start Over time I might grow to understand this more Also the numbers dont often line up well My metro station might say 100 per week but in the overall transport graph only 20 people are said to be using the metrobuy this game Not since SimCity 4 Rush Hour have I enjoyed an experience this much I find it hard to suggest major ways to improve the concept I strongly dislike casual approaches to the genreand this is not one of those Yet I also think it makes the genre more accessibleImagine being EA and screwing up SimCity so muchthat someone in Finland got fed up and made a better gameIn 201after 10 years of waitingthe Sim City community of moddersfansand aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City Ten years is a long time to wait for a gamebut people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title Long story shortit was a massive dissapointment Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRMAlways On APMtiny mapsforced origin installationlacking mod supportno steam supportand a forced multiplayer aspect  I decided to not purchase the titleso it may have been a decent gamebut 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossibleand gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game  And for that Maxis is now out of business They will never make another gameand it is no ones fault but theirsand here it is people Sim City 5but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time  The game runs so smoothly with so much going onit really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near itthere are dynamic shadowszoning is backand it is not dumbed down  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim Cityand you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand  The map editor is awesomethe community is thrivingthere are mods to do anything you wantand this is the city building game weve all been waiting for  I can not possibly reccomend this moreThis really is the greatest city simulator there isand will be for quite a long time Im having trouble finding ANYthing wrong with this game Ive played most SimCitysAnno 2070Cities XL and almost fell for the Cities XXL nonsense Then I found this gameand my life is completeit doesnt have that featureless feeling some of the plainer UIs havehowever you do need a good processor and a few GB of RAM to play it idealyno glitches or anything Theres even a little inengine physics to things like carsrivers and treesunlike 201s SimcityCopper Creek on the workshop is my favoriteits not really a big deal are things like garbage and deathcare They tend to get overwhelming and lots of weekly money needs to be spent to fix them When your landfills are full or more people are dying than you can transport to a cemetary kind of thing Id recommend finding something better on the workshop or using the asset editor to lowerraise some gampleay values in those buildings slightlyyour citizens in this game are bornageand die eventually Dont worry thoughtheyll be replaced by their children for the largest part But there may be a point in the game where a lot of people suddenly die and its a little scary This is because of your senior citizens getting a little too old if you know what I mean Be sure to prepare for this if you find it to happenI am not completely certtain if its just that playrhrough of mine of if its actually a phenomenon within the game   Pthis game really is a worthwhile investment and it honestlycoming from someone whos a dear citybuilder fansteps on all the other titles and I mean ALL of them Youll love itFor 2 weeks I debated purchasing ibCities Skylinesbi Im sure I annoyed most of my friends by weighing the pros and cons with them Eventually I saidscrew it and made the purchase I have not regretted it sinceibCities Skylinesbi is your basic city simulator You start off with a blank landscape and a highway off to the sideof which is the key to growing your sprawling city Sounds very simpleyes Wellnot quite ibCities Skylinesb igoes beyond just throwing houses and shops together Youre required to check pollutants in the form of ground and noisedissiptating clogged roadwaysproviding entertainmentand so much more Essentiallythis game is everything that you could ever ask for in a simulatormy oh mythe graphics  they are absolutely stunning if youre able to play on high graphicsthen go for it The view is very rewarding and satisfying Great jobiColossalijob and housing demandsetc This game is definitely no joke It demands your every attention and is not something you can just idleI can still enjoy it to its fullest thoughthen disregard the iDeluxe Editioni unless you really want 5 extra monuments plus as a way to support the developers further You can always get the 5 extra monuments through the workshopits your call2016 Ive finally gotten around to purchasing both DLCs and Ill provide a brief breakdownubleisure and tourism specializations night clubsetcand extra buildings Some people are noting that it comes with a night and day cyclebut I was experiencing the cycle without the DLC maybe Im just confusing somethingobviouslyhah Also snowmapssnowplows and snowpilesmore edicts and heating systemsthe DLCs are not worth it at their full price Yesthey serve to enhance gameplay and also act as a way for you to support the developers as well With the little amount of content that both of them offerhoweverand at 12 price tagsId say your money would be better spent elsewhere Soeither wait until the DLCs are cheaper Id say under 8 would be more appropriateavoid the DLCs completelyor just splurge because you want to If youre an achievement hunter like methen youll need to purchase the DLCsthen I would suggest getting iAfter Darki first It has been much more enjoyable due to its far more superior offering of content Quite franklyI havent even really played with iSnowfalli since it doesnt offer much beyond its name Its completely up to youespecially when youre looking to upgrade themsuch as the Cargo Harbour to Hub without having to go through the process of destroying it firstibCities Skylinesbi is honestly one of the best purchases I have ever made to date on Steam Ive already lost 22 hours since my purchase 4 days agoand it has left me impressed each time Ive exited the game If youre into simulatorsI highly recommend this one  I hope it leaves as much of an impression on you as it has on meyou seriously cant go wrong with this title BravoiColossal Orderi and iParadox Interactiveibravo thank you for this amazing gameplease dont hesitate to ask  I will answer them to the best of my ability On that notecheers and happy building2016b FREE STADIUM DLC Thank youiColossal Orderi  this game just gets better and better You never fail to impress with the amount of dedication and love you have for your gameyes this game can be played offline Ive done around  7 hours of gameplay offline due to power outages That didnt stop me from getting on this

already like citybuildersthis is a great place to start74000 modsyou wont regret it at allh1bCities Skylines Reviewbh1fans of the genre like myself become eager with anticipation Unfortunatelywe have been left wanting for nearly a decade Yesits been that long since a really decent sim has been released Upon learning that one of my favorite publishersParadox Interactivehad a City Building simulation in the works I knew this was a game I could not wait to get my hands on Paradox Interactive is known for being a leader in challenging and entertaining  strategic games so I felt if anybody could do it rightthey could Having been able to test the game for almost a full week before its official release I can say that my trust was not misplaced Cities Skylines is everything I hoped it would be This is city building done rightCities Skylines is far and abovethe best city building simulation ever made Period Colossal Order has come up with a recipe that ingenuously combines just the right amount of simplistic game design with a flavorful amount of challenging gameplay to create a masterpiece Fans of City Building simulations will definitely not want to miss grabbing this gamebut more about true city management Do things right and your populus will be greatful and steadily grow Do things poorly and your city will clear out faster than a zombie apocalypse could make it happen Numerous tools are at your disposal as expected with an interesting dynamic that truly brings the realism into the game Cities can be carved up into different districts and each district can have its own set of policies and characteristics Players even choose the names But it doesnt just stop there Players can give custom names to just about everything in the game including its citizensColossal Order has easily found a way to challenge players along these lines Cars and trainsships and planes Cities Skylines has it all The water simulation is spectacular as well Placing your sewage disposal upstreamfor examplecould result in contaminating your citizens water supply Realistic flooding is another possible scenario The maps included are gigantic and beautifully designed terrains that offer endless possibilites when planning your city and continued population growth unlocks the ability to expand to adjacent tiles on the map as well as making more buildings and options available such as taking out loans These options are tied in with overall success and not just simply from having enough funds availablea feature which definitely enhances the experienceperhaps one of this games best features is the inclusion of asset and map editting tools to allow the Steam Community to heavily mod this game in order to continue its growth and stability in the future while adding tons of extra content and replay valueabout the only area I found lacking in this game is not having a variety of random events such as natural disasters I cannot say with certainty why the developers chose not to include them and perhaps they will be added later as DLC since most Paradox Interactive games are known to offer quality additional content long after initial releases The modding community could possibly offer them as wellsince I predict the Steam Workshop will quickly fill up with a large variety of added content Firesfloodspollutioninfrastructure and transportation issues are still more than enough to keep players challenged and fully engaged thoughso overall its not really a major concernbe sure to follow our curator group urlhttpsteamcommunitycomgroupsOriginalCuratorsGroupcurationFollow Original Curator GroupurliThis is a truncated version of this video reviewor simply want to try one for the first timeI don’t hesitate at all in saying Cities Skylines is a superb choiceI was chomping at the bit to get my hands on this thing I’ve spent about 40 hours on it so farso the question is does it succeed in its goal of topping SimCity Wellin a wordYESyou start with a blank plot of land and a set of tools at your disposal Generally the goal is to build a citygrow it as big as you likeand make sure it doesn’t die You have a single highway connection to start out withwhich acts as the first of many entrances to your city Use the road tools to draw some roadsand you’ll see that you get groups of tiles extending from the side of them These tiles can be filled with three types of zones residentialcommercialand industrialwhich will become homesshopsand factories Although more come into play later onlike highdensity residential and commercial zonesas well as office zonesthe central system of RCI demand is very much in play here The more demand for a zone you havethe more people will move in to fill those zones and the more service buildings youll requireso you’ll want to balance their placement with the other needs of the city Beyond these basicsit’s totally up to you as to what’s nextbut once you start reaching its bordersyou have the option to buy moreup to 6 square miles worth more if you mod the game with the excellent tile mod on Steam Althoughsometimes the game gets a bit bogged down in ambiguities regarding its logicmostly regarding trafficservicesand lack of UI information But once I started to figure these systems outthe challenge in fixing them was hugely rewarding Cities XXL and SimCity 5 were entirely too easyand if you screwed those cities upthat was a real feat of ineptitude Herea doomed city can arise from something as simple as building an intersection instead of a multilane traffic circleand that’s kind of awesome But it doesnt feel cheapit feels like something to learn from and perform better next time There are also some included mods from the developerswhich act as cheats and difficulty settings in lieu of more traditional menu options And on top of that theres an incredible potential for usermade modswith a full blessing from the developer to do so with the included Steam Workshop supportI start seeing zone layouts in my ceilingand traffic patterns in my cereal Just give me a pot of coffee and watch me while away dozens of hours creating the perfect balance of land valuecity servicesand mass transit systems and be completely content It’s blissfulstressfuland compelling on a level that few games ever achieve for me anymore There are so many details that I lovelike the way you can paint zones with different brushesthe sweeping orchestral soundtrackthe guidelines that appear when placing roadsthe fact you can flood your city if you dam a river improperlythe way any zone has buildings that fit into any plot shapeand on and oneven when surpassing 100000 citizensit still played solidly with minimal frame rate issues on both my desktop and laptop Colossal Order pulled off a true colossal order here they made a better SimCity than Maxis could requiescat in pace And all this with a comparatively small budgeta team of a dozen or so peopleand the Unity Engine Just wow Cities Skylines is a total slap in the face to SimCity 5and man is it a beautiful thing to behold And the price you get twice the game at half the price of its rivals launch price Folksthis is what I like to call “doing it right” They could’ve charged double and I still would recommend itbut wow This is a topnotch game at a bargain launch priceand it makes me want to cry tears of joyLet me give you a history lessonand it was alsogreat  Are you seeing a theme hereSimCity 4 was releasedand it was perfectionwhich was a thing12 years after the last great city building game comes SkylinesCollossal Order has hit one out of the park  Runs great on older machineslooks greatand has GREAT mod supportwhile writing the introduction I was trying to think of a negative element that came up  Still dont have oneProsand I have a computer that doesnt meet the requirements512 MB  or ATI Radeon HD 5670512 MB is the minimumCities Skylines is a City BuilderSimulation gameand it’s fantasticSim Cityin every conceivable way  Where Maxis managed to somehow fail in a genre they pretty much inventedColossal Games and Paradox Interactive have treated Maxis’ effort as a treatise on what not to dowithout a doubtthe game Sim City 201 should have beenthe graphics Skylines is very well optimizedwith large detailed cities bustling along with no hiccupsand some nice options in the settings to fiddle with if you do experience any problems The game looks greatwith lots of detail Buildings grow and “level up” as you watchchanging their value and appearance and attracting different types of people and businesses You can easily identify different areas and specialtiesas well as transportpower and sewerage systems by colour using the mostly intuitive UI Clicking on peoplehouses and buildings will give you more detailsand identifying problems or successes is made very easyhowever You’ll be juggling residents needs and wants by ensuring access to clean waterpowerefficient transportationentertainment and medicineto name just a few You’ll have to control pollutionboth physical and noisecrime and disease There are a variety of ways to do thishow you go about it is up to youIndustrialRetail and Office Then set up a functioning power grid and clean waterwaste water sewerage system After thatit’s all about placing public services to attract more peopleand expanding your city across the map And what a map You initially start on each map with a 2 square kilometre parcel of land in which to buildbut can expand out over 8 such parcels out of 25 available per map That saidit is trivial to mod out the limitationand if your computer can handle ityou absolutely can build on the entire map As a bonusif you don’t like any of the premade maps the game ships withyou can easily use the ingame map editor to create or recreate your own map to play on There is even an asset editor tooso you can create and modify the in game assets to your preferencesand work how you’d expect them to This is a simulation gameafter all After you’ve finished zoning your cityyou can then create districtswhich allow you to apply policies city wide or just to select areas Make the CBD have compulsory smoke detectors and free public transportwhile giving the poor and destitute section of town a rebate on green energy Ban heavy vehicles from residential areas to lower noise and decongest trafficbut require careful planning Take advantage of natural oil reservesmine orefarmcut down your forests or simply go for “Generic”where you’ll be making random stuff The finance and taxation system is easily understood and superbyou’re given plenty of optionssuch as numerous road typespublic transportcargo shipstrains and aeroplanesthe game has an incredibly effective water simulation too Dams will burst and water flows realistically throughout the mapand pollution will be carried downstream with currentswith integrated Steam Workshop support People have already uploaded thousands of custom maps and assets to the workshopas well as gameplay tweaks and it’s pretty safe to say that if you find something wrong with the game that you think could be betterthere is a very good chance that there is already a mod for it on the workshopwhat are the consthere is a mod for thatwhich would have been nice Butthere is a mod for thatthere is a mod for that There is another one that enables a First Person View from and person you click on in the streetthe workshop has hundreds availabledownloaded and added to the available maps with a single clickusing the in game people as avatars Why Who knows But it’s possibleif you like city builders or simulation gamesyou cannot go wrong with Cities Skylines It is everything you could want out of this genreeat your heart outWithout a doubt one of the best City Builders of all time The price is so reasonable for the amount of quality content you get both from the default game and from all the modders on the Steam workshop Im so looking forward to what new things will be released in the future for this game The Developers also listen to their customers and have been adding more modding tools for us to use to create new assets for players Thanks COSo I made my first citygetting it from zero to eight thousand when I finally unlocked dams At this point I was doing terrible with electricitybecause I really didnt want to make many coal plantsso the second I saw Dams unlocked I saved to make one I found a great spot that could solve my energy needs foreverand placed the dam As I clicked I knew I made a terrible mistake I made the dam directly beside the densest part of my Residential District Water poured over the side of the dam and into the citydrowning my population and creating abandoned buildings When the water finally calmed down it was in the form of a lake in the center of the cityhalfway in residentialhalfway in commercial In an attempt to fix this I started pumping the water out which actually seems to have workedbut I put the output in a place where it flowed into both of my main water pumps And while I was only pumping plain water out of my citythe game counted it as waste water I was feeding my citizens fresh water poop So while water was killing the center of my citypoop water was killing the rest The surge of water also managed to destroy my garbage collectionso I got this terrible mix of overflowing riversoverflowing garbageand overflowing sickness Modding from day oneexcept for Steambut dont worrythe genre is in safe hands Colossal Orders hands1 Build a roadLets start with this it is an amazing city building game Its the best in generations BUTlike any other gameit has its downfalls toobut you can expand to a total of 9 of themfor a 18x18km area or 24 km or 201 mi area Another pluside is that there are already mods to expand your city size to a total of 25 tilesfor a 50x50 km area2500 kmor 155 mi area The size of this doesnt make your computer lageitherunless you dont meet the minimum requirements for the gameand you can explore the lives of each of them The only problem is the traffic Its terrible If there all 6 lanes availablethey will all go in one lane Geniuswatch this video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwVoP1Um95SglistUUZYqx1ak0CYKhUQY6QtxDQfrom perfecting neighborhoods to fixing water pipes The only reason I knocked 1 point off is because there are no disasterswhich in my opinion is something required for a city building gameyou can model your own buildings but it is still great It has its own stylewhen your in a city trying to buildpop ups everywhere makes it hard to workit is very cheap at the time of its releaseFinallythe city builder everyone was expectingand still wantedthe workshop for this game is bat shit crazythe rest of the game is more than enough and then someand an EA park in which homeless vagrants can do what homeless vagrants doand how youre paid in return  by asking what it wants and listening to what it asks for Not telling it what it needs insteadEAThings I can do in Cities Skylines that I couldnt do in SimCity 5I received it for free with another game I had purchased I must admit it was one of the weakest SimCity games I had played but I still put some time into it because I appreciated that the Maxis team had tried something differentI would rather play a game made in 1994 than one made in 201 And when SimCity came out with an expansion pack for it a few months after releaseI was done Done with SimCity A game that I have played and loved my entire life The first PC game I owned other than solitaire and that crazy pinball game that came with Microsoft 
1,1899  077Ive played a lot of games for a long time this one is most impressivedied young and fast and rarely does greedrevenge and murder go unpunished or is easily forgotten With the invention of the telegraph and now the phone and news travel by train our great country seemed so much smaller and a lot harder to hide from the lawIve played games since the 90s and no other game gave me such a great emotional rollercoaster ride as RDR Its not just a gameits a 10season western HBO show that you interact and engage with grandpa used to love westernsHaving not played nor watched RDR1 or RDRI went into this with a totally clean slategunplaymovementanimations really slow and the missions quite sameishthe game grows on you as it progressesby the end of the main chaptersyou are fully attached to the games charactersthe following on with the Epilogue is amazing and the credits that follow are also great toorandom encountershunting and side missions etcIve done all side missions and optionalsthis game is a masterpiece1010 once you become accustomed to the general slowness of the game compared to fast paced gamesdone most side content  summary  BEST GAME EVERgreat gameplaying RDR before RDR1 has made me appreciate both games more than I would have playing RDR1 10 years agoDont buy for multi playerI am old and in the way but i have been waiting for a GREAT western mmo  for years and years it sems that now it is here At 70 yrs old i prolly played pc games for more years than I have left to playbut until another GREAT western saga gets released I will be founs on this oneOnly complaint I have is that they asked you to name your character and then they use your user name for social clubDUMB CRAP   you characters name that you proplly put alot of time into kaming up appears NOWHERE   so my char Lupo LaRaza is now named whispersxx Stupid crap   NE WAY if that is my only complaint i have to give RDR a big THUMB upthe only crime Arthur is guilty ofis stealing my heartFOR PEOPLE BEING TOLD TO REPURCHASE THE GAMEallow me  Go to Steam settings DownloadsClear download cacheand try to launch the game  this worked for meHope it works for youThere are storiesgood storiesand then there are those stories youll remember for a long time This game has it all Adventuretons of things to doa marvelous storyfun gameplayand most of all it leaves you something You really care for the charactersthe gang family becomes like your familyand when things go bad you really want to help Of course in the meantime you can huntrobkill and do whatever nasty or good thing you preferbut you know someone is waiting for you And the ending will bring tears to your eyes for different things in multiple occasions Add to this an incrediblevery realistic environmenta perfect western setting that would make Sergio Leone proud and you have an absolute masterpiece Oh i really wish Red Dead Redemption 1 were on Steam too maybe with some patience Just go and get itThis review is for the single playerspent 150 hours to reach 91 completion and would need maybe 50 or 100 more hours to 100 it I didnt try the online yetill add the review for that after i try itbut its a long game with some excellent missionsas usual when it come to Rockstar games and the humor is spot oncharacters are great and the story as a whole is a great prequel to the excellent Red Dead Redemptionnothing hard if you want to jump from one mission to anotherbut itll take you a bit of time to get familiar with all the activities that you can doespecially the hunting which is essential if you want to craft the best items in the gameeven while not at the ultra settingsthis game is insanely beautifuli never felt a world full with life as much as in RDRRockstar went into each detail to create the last days of the Wild West and its a huge payoff for the playersyou really feel like you riding with a gang in the early 1900s And with photo modewhatever you are doing and wherever you are on the mapbe sure that youll end up with a nice photo Ill add to that the dynamic weather and different environment that wont change just the looks but also the fauna and flora of the regionfrom food to ammo to tonicsalso loved the weapon modificationsto make each weapon customized to a different lookyou can fast travel easily using camptrain or stagecoachbut i dont advise thatyoull miss a lot of nice things like thata lot of random events Plus there is way too many things to collect that will take hours and hours to find them alladd to that around 100 challenges and you have over 00 hours of gameplay without even touching the online part of the game and even with all that time im sure that youll miss a few of easter eggs or interesting places in this gameso its highly recommended for anyone who have the patience to learn what this game have to offereach 5 or 10 minutes i receive this errorthe balls on your horse shrink in the winterThis game is more detailed than my lifeIm 50long time gamerfirst time a game has been emotional for me It is just an epic experience to play I have had issues with crashingsound problemsreboot fixannoying cursor showingswitch to windowed and then back to fullso it has been frustrating at times but generally runs pretty well and looks beautiful 1440p mostly ultra on Ryzen 3600  RTX060sadlybefore I play its ilke againWhat can I say that hasnt been said and that you dont knowthe missionsfrom the smallest to all the main missions are worthy of oscarsit felt so real to methat I would spend hours living and breathing the gameI felt I was thereat that timespending time fishing and huntingsometimes for hoursand heavy raincollecting every piece of clothing and trying to look dashing at all timestook care of themor dragged them behind my horse when I wasnt in the mood for their BSI was a cowboy Nobody will convince me otherwiseThis game teach us something very important Its never too late to be a good personand you can always seek for redemption Its perfect in every single wayone of the best for sure I love you Arthur MorganObviously this game has been given countless amazing reviewsall I have to add is thatI havent seen one anywhere near this class since Fallout New VegasThis game is not for everyone It is most definitely NOT Grand Theft Auto with horses Its slowpaced and immersivea reality you live in rather than a game you playyou dont Its much slowertooget it Its incredibleRockstar Games is known for setting benchmarks when it comes to their open world titles Red Dead Redemption  is their best work to datewithout a doubt Unquestionably beautifulvast and detailed It breathes life From the tiniest toad to the scary Grizzly beareverything feels alive and convincing Its an environment so well crafted that it makes you wonder whether it isnt a real world within your own computer Nonplayable characters have their own liveswith a routine that they follow religiously just like we do Some do hard worksome drink all daysome mourn their losses Its hard to believe its just a video game I remember when Skyrim had something similar and people couldnt believe how insanely realistic it was Imagine thatbut twice as convincing Thats RDR  for you They feel so alive that you feel bad for killing them with your plethora of periodaccurate weaponrya game is not solely made of environment and their inherent goodies Thats where the story mode comes in Andas many of you may know by noweither from YouTube or any of the media portals you routinely visit for the daily dose of gaming newsits a masterpiece Storytelling is not an easy craftbut they have visibly dominated it after decades and decades of duly delivered benchmarks of how an open world game should be They make it seem easyalmost as if anyone could do it Memorable charactersinsane character development just like we like it and then fantastic endings based on your own decisions As linear as it may beforcing you to do things their way rather than setting your imagination free and letting you decide how to approach a missionit still allows you to take certain decisions that will shape the moral values of your charactertherefore leading it to a specific outcome Games dont often get the whole moral debate rightunderstandably sobecause they are empty characters with a prerecorded set of phrases and reactions that cant resonate with you But Arthur Morgan is different Its a rather captivating individualthat feels real Real enough that you will often find yourself questioning whether to kill or spare someoneor if you should or not help that person in need And inevitably feel the pain of uncertainty of the future  or the lack thereof  that lies aheadand watch your character grow through all the hardships of the outlaw life A novellike main character that is a criminalkillercruel and savage but also a human being like all of us And humanity winsin the end Arthur learns what it is to be humanand there is no better teacher than life itselfthe typical Rockstar linearity and the underwhelming online modethe story is something out of this world It truly outstands Goes above and beyond the average video game storytelling Its something youve got to experience to understand A mustplay for every gamer out thereIt was not a gameit was an experience
1,A rather complex grand strategy gameyou pick a country to control starting from the year 1444 all the way to 1821 There isnt any fixed objective to aim for its  a good idea to try to get the achievements offered such as world dominationas most are a real challenge to earnallowing movement of you armies from one to another in real time  nothing here is turn based Battles arent controlled by youas in total war you make your army walk onto the same province as an opposing armyand the battle outcome is decided in part by random dice rollsand in part by factors you can influencesuch as generalsterrainmorale of troops The same can be said for naval battleswhere different types of ships behave differently depending on what sea province you are fighting inif they are in the open oceanor in a closed sea such as the Mediterraneancountries can have a number of different governmentssuch as feudal monarchies or merchant republicsall that give different bonuses and malusesand some such as republics offer the possibility to choose what type of leader you wantso as to give you more of a certain type of monarch points You can offer alliancesroyal marriagessupport rebelscreate false claims on provinces you dont own to give you a casus belli a reason to go to war among other thingsthe list is really really hugeyou have 3 different types of monarch points AdministrativeDiplomaticMilitaryeach that serve different purposes For examplemilitary points can be spent to buy a new generalor to treat a province harshly if rebels are likely to rise up there As of the Art of War updaterebel mechanics have changes slightly Instead of each province possibly spawning rebels depending on a percentagenow each rebel faction has a counter that goes up or down depending on your countrys stability and province modifierssuch as nationalismculture or religion Once the counter reaches 100multiple stacks of rebels spawn Other points can be used to change your capitalannex vassalsgain provinces in peace dealscreate buildings and much more The gain of monarch points depend on your rulerthat can give from 0 points each to 6 point each month By spending some of your incomeyou can also hire advisorsthat can add to your monthly monarch points incomeand grant you some nationwide bonusesyou have merchants and you can choose to send them to various trade nodesand you can choose if you want them to try and collect money from that node with a malusor to send the money that you collect upstreamto a different node where you can collect from Having colonies and trade agreements with other countries helps your trade incomewhile being embargoed reduces your trade in nodes that the country embargoing you controlsgiven out for free Now fortresses are placed in various provinces in your country you can also choose to build them once you have the moneyand they exert a zone of control Provinces without forts on them are very easy to conquer while in warwhile provinces with fortresses on them have to be seiged or assaulted to fall under the attackers control Forts now block enemy units from advancingallowing the defending nation to have some space to reorganize and prepare defenceswhile the attacking nation has to carefully choose how and where to attack so as to lose the least amount of troops Unoccupied forts also have a zone of control If you conquer a province next to a fortbut leave the fort to itselfthe fort will free any occupied neighbouring province while at war I love these changesespecially if you play a large nationas it adds a whole extra layer of strategy to how you build up you nations provincesbut with each DLC comes a vast amount of free content as wellso it might be advisable to buy the base game before buying DLCso as to see what you think about the game before commiting too much If you choose to play online with a friend that owns the DLCseven without owining the DLCs yourselfthe game activates themso its possible to try them out before you buy It would also be a good idea to try and watch a tutorial beforehand Arumba on youtube comes to mindas the game doesnt do a great job of explaining all it has to offerand occasionaly frustrating gamebut I found that the more I played itthe more I enjoyed it Im constantly learning new things I can use to my adantageand the game is becoming more satisfying due to thatAfter playing Civilization 5 for quite a long timeI have started to become interested in a deeper gameplay with deeper political consequencesbetter religionsand more interesting colonize mechanics I couldnt do in Civilization Of course there are plenty of mods to extend the gameplay for Civilizationbut a new gamewhere everything is newis fresh and excitingbut the music dynamically changes when going to war with another countrywhich is trying to boost the morale of the playerwhich usually works The weird part about the peaceful songs arethat they are somewhat forgettablebut will stick to your head so that you may find yourself whistling a tune of a melody a week laterfor 2€ each so you are not missing out on too much The ones which are more expensive have definitely more going on For example the new DLC Conquest of Paradise enhances the colonization mechanics which wereat the beginning of the gamea bit lacklusterbut more on that laterthe interesting part about them isthat you are absolutely free to choose which date you are going to startthat means you can play against revolutionary French as Austria or play as Portugal to colonize the new worldthere are militaristicdiplomaticpassive and colonizing leaders for each country with their accurate ruler of that time That isuntil you start playing and the heirs will be completely different than actual history of course The human player gets treated just like an AI to other AIsif you conquer they will hate youif you dont have any alliances they are going to attack youthats why theres that certain point of risk of alliances with the AIwhich can make your AI ally to an enemy faster than you might think Just never trust them too muchthere are currently 71 unique idea groups for specific countrys18 group ideas for country regions like Italy and 8 possible slots for your own idea groups to choose which consist of another 7 ideas That sounds like a lotand it certainly was a pain for the creatorsbut it was well worth it It gives most of the countries just their own specialty But Im not going to go into that sort of stuffColonize more than 5 provinces in a certain region and a colonial vassal gets created The colonial vassal is just like another countrybut he has to pay taxes and cant attack you You can control these taxes on your ownbut never set these taxations too highbecause you know what happened with the USA and Great Britain at that time Independence wars definitely can get a strain on youif you know that you have to travel across the Atlantic Ocean to fight a warbut I just want to bore the casuals and try to keep the strategic fans interestedespecially the fighting mechanics and monarch pointsbut I dont want to tell you everything There is that certain interest I wanted to awake in some peopleso that they are going to try this game for themselvesand not get ultimately bored because I just told them everything of the game40€ certainly is quite a lot in the steam shopbut thats why special sales exist If its getting 50 off I can definitely recommend itand hasnt even bored me a bit so faror try it and hate itand if you are still reading thisthanks for reading my first proper review It means quite a lot to meLets start off with the assumption that youve never played a grand strategy game before Youve seen pictureswatched videos and heard great tales about map paintingand it peaked your interest You end up herefor whatever reasonopening your walletready to throw some money at Paradox for Europa Universalis 4 Greatyouve made a fantastic choicedepening on how you look at iton how willing you are to learnyoull probably open it and click on the tutorial button first thing Youre probably going to give the tutorial a few shotsbefore saying screw it and closing the gamegoing back to doing something more productivelike watching youtube and playing other games All is wellthen a dark thought comes to lightgot to conquer the worldand youre right back at ityou open the gameplaying through the tutorial all over againand again You check up some tutorial videos and maybe check in on a wiki or forumjust to be surethe very basic mechanics there is to learnand you feel ready to take on the world Orat the very leasta few bits here and there Booting up the gameyou feel the excitementready to click on singleplayerthe world at your disposal Chances areyoull probably pick a nation synonymous to your native countryor at the very leastsomething similar You look at the mapthere it isyour nation Looks differentyes Because it iswe got a couple of interesting starts if you dont fancy your ownnot because it probably is a small and weak country at the timenoyou just fancy playing someone elseEuropewe got quite a mess going on Germany is in shamblesFrance and England are at it againthe Ibearians are finishing off their reconquista and Austria is being an overprotective Emperor Denmark is just being a nuisanceMuscovy starts map painting right off the bat and the Ottomans are consuming the remnants of the Eastern Roman Empire Now you ask yourselfwhy on earth would I start in this shiteholeand the answer is simpleyou start in itor it comes to youthe Ottomans will devour you before the end of the decade and after the Ibearians are done with their deedthey start cutting down somecutting down on the re in reconquista that ishahastarting the conquista of all Northern Africaand if that doesnt stop youthe TunisianOttoman alliance willmore specifically India Now this would be a great choiceif you were familiar with the tech mechanic and how to deal with it Either wayafter recent patchesyou can now also get some sweet redblue and yellow paint spilled all over youGreat BritainFrance and Spainthat isyoure in deep trouble as a beginner Your neighbouring nations in India or Indochina will sell out their provinces to filthy rich Europeansgiving them more of the good stufftrade income Once they get a taste of thatyou can bet that theyll be all over you all the time Not to mentionif youre really unluckyMingalso known as Chinamight just get there beforehandat least you can escape them if you play in Europeenjoy your constant tributary wars and attrition Doesnt really matteryou got the money and the men to keep that going for a millennium Dont thoughbefore youre a true warmongererdiplomat and rebel supressor youre probably not going to last for longtech penaltieshordes and rebels will start your demizeand the colonizers will finish it Its an easy nationbut get used to the game first with some more stable nations insteadyoull be their stepping stone to India and other colonizable areas If thats something you fancytry it You probably wont enjoy it though Its no fun being annexed and or vassalized by Europeansthe chill game Dontleave Youre going to hate itand a pro tipnever play in mesoamericathats just you embracing doom on your own You dont want to start in the Americas alreadyyoure hardly familiar with the game mechanicsor the native mechanicsand not ready to take on the smallpox that will be brought in from the colonizersmuch less their troopsthats the startes for youroughly You also got the steppe hordeshowever handling with Muscovy can be problematic Thoughif you want a game mainly focusing on landnot having to worry about pesky liquids and shipsthen Muscovy is for you Here its all about taming the steppes and conquering as much to the northsoutheast and west as you possibly can This can be a great step after you have learnt the basics of combatand you feel comfortable taking on the PolishLithuanian union with a small taste of a Danish invasions to your northwho to start as Like many would tell youas I willstart as PortugalCastilleEngland or the Ottomans With Portugal you get to chill and get used to the games mechanicsone of which is colonizingand that will benefit you greatly in the future You dont have many enemies to deal with with the exception of the nativesso you get somewhat trained with the combat mechanics Youll get to experience how the navy functions and how colonization affects your trade to name a few Trade is importantexcept youre in a stronger positionespecially if you manage to keep France at bay and Aragon alone until you get a personal union over them England is also a good startas your navies are the strongest in the game at the start of the game Howeverif you are completely newI suggest surrendering the land of mainland europe to Franceso to avoid the annoyance of having wars declared on youletting you focus on the British Isles and colonizing in peacecorecostwar mechanics and the like without many nations caring to stop you Be careful howeveryou might be powerfulbut a coalition of AustriaHungary and PolandLithuania might be too much for you to chewand once that startsthe Mamluks wont waste any time stabbing you in your backalliancesmiltary tab and all its small numbersarmiesnaviestradegoodsstates  territories Focus also on your nations ideasand try to pick ideas that will build upon the ones you already haveor things you plan on doing in the future As Portugalexploration ideas works as a starter for colonizingand as Muscovyreligiousquantity or humanist ideas will work These ideas on Muscovy is based on their need to expand quicklythereby manpoweror all the heathen religions theyll have to deal with in the steppesthereby religiousor thanks to the new religion state updateshumanist ideas will sufficeso Ill end with this Youll notice this game has a bunch of DLC Yestoo much one might say These arent needed by a beginner by any meansand bring for the most part really great quality of life things into the gameas well as some really cool new mechanicssuch as great powers You can look through each one and decide on which one you feel would fit you the best and buy one or two as the time goes I would not recommend buying it all at the same if youve just startedbad idea There are lots of things to get into already without the DLCEU4 players can form Prussiabut cant form a basic conversation with a womanOver and over again PDX has released buggy unfinished DLC for this game Leviathan is what broke the camels back Edit June 18  Launched the game for the first time since writing the original review in every sphere and Ive learned a lot about the world as this game will pique my interest in a topic and I go and look it up on my ownI understand that this game is based on historynot a carbon copy This game ignited a love for geography and history in mebelieve me I get every DLC on release and race to get those new juicy achievements Baring some Budgetmonk and Flurryworry level game playIve pretty much done or attempted it allI play on speed 4 and pause all the time Up until this patch you could scroll across the world as your game ticked away days with no performance issues at all Your HRE vassal swarm would crawl across Asia into China with no issues at all Nowyou have to pause the game if you want to move your camera lest you want to lag 4k hours on the same PC and it has neverever lagged like this beforeand Im sure there are people who had theirs higher There is a requirement in the Age of Revolutions to have your capitol at 50 devthis used to mean something Now everyone can have that done in 40 years from game start instead of being done with 80 years left in the game By the time I was finished my run I had over 270 dev in my capitol and that was only the mid 1600s What a joke North American and Aborigine tribes soar above 50 dev with ease and thats still pre 1500 Was this even tested How did this mechanic make it throughan OPM in Indiaas an example When I did the 52 Garhs  achievement it was pre Emperor patchI had to pull a lot of stops to get Jaunpur as an ally and then I had to wait a longlong time for my tiny nation to be able to build up the favors to call in my attack dog Curry favors has made this an absolute joke Expanding the favors aspect of the game sounds good on paperbut wow was this ever poorly executed If you choose to still play this patch then you need to have an ally the entire game as they are just another source of free money and soldiers In many situations any injection of cash is hard to come byrandom events or they cost you a war Now just wait until you have 10 favors and every 5 years your get a  of your allys treasury You can even take a piece of his manpower poolone of the most important bottlenecking resources in the early gamefile now works   Game Breaking Crashes  This is the absolute piece de resistance of this patch In my currentwell now deadcampaign I wanted to use the new broken mechanics of pillage and favors to help me get an achievement Ive been after for yearsAfrican Power and the Fetishist one to go with it  Everything is going my waycolonizers are scared of me because its 1545 and I have half of Africa under me and my capitol is massive I spawned colonialism and this game is just smooth sailingfinally I can get these done Lo and beholdno I cannot With my auto save at Sept 11545 that is the end of my run When I unpause the game it goes until Sept 5th and crashes Over and over again I found out that the literal file for the save is full Just over 100 years from start date the file has no more room and cannot write beyond this date Incredibleas lame as that sounds its true This game inspired me to learn Now all this game does is inspire me to look for something else to doshame on you Groogy I know you know what youve created is badbut its so much more than that You let the glorious game you worked so hard on for so many years fall into ruin Rome has fallen to barbariansthe great city has been sackedthings will never be the same again It will take more than a couple hotfixes to revive this gameIf youre going to buy itjust buy the base gamethen roll it back to an early version say 151 You can do this by right clicking on it in the librarypropertiesbetasand select it from the drop down listunless you have money to burnthen pick up the DLCs in the order they came outand roll the version you play forward to match Trying to play later versions without DLC is just not a fun experience as the game balance is calculated on the basis of having the DLCby in largeso you end up paying hence the frustration at paradoxs dlc policy or roll backyoull need to be playing the same versionand love itbut does seem harder and harder to recommend on account of the cost particularly the hiking of prices in less afluent parts of the world Expansions for EU3 certainly had more content for the money At the moment though it is still worth buying and starting off slowly on if you think it might be your thing There are few games out there that people put so many hours intoafter allNever thought that a strategy game would be the most bthrillingb gaming experience I havehour long planning and carefully forging alliances and marriageswhile keeping an eye on which direction rival countries are sending their diplomats tobecause one wrong move can turn your plans to dustis much more addictive than you might think The relief you feelafter a long term plan of yours is finally set into successful motionis not describableI might have won the war through logistics alreadyhas actually been said alreadybut I just cant pass on the chance to show my appreciation for it Im b90hrsb inand Im still finding new ways to play this gameeverytime I start it up Its complexdeep and rewards the player that thinks on a larger scale One of the best purchases I made in years1444 Hours inYou would have never of heard of itTry me AdanaOh that is near Antiochgoing towards SyriaI believeafter a few years of researchthat I enjoy this gameparadox pleaseI love this game  Just under 2500 hrs of my life enjoying itParadoxyou need to listen to your community It is wrong to make the base game unplayable without paying for everincreasing DLCs  At bestyoull make a little  now but lose a generation of gamersefficient and nimble  Your DLC pricing and practice indicate a bloated structure spending too much time counting the moneytake a brave action  Do something radical that recognizes the dissatisfaction of your existing community and for heavens sakeDONT CHARGE THEM for whatever you decide to do  Try to be developers firstand corporate faces secondNEW BUYERS BEWARE  Read the manymany comments about DLC policy and cost before you commitThanks humble bundlenow I can finally play this game after 5 years of waitingSadly due to the rapidly globalized economy and the world we live inexploiting indigenous populations is not nearly as easy nor profitable as it used to be But thanks to the fine people at Paradox InteractiveI can unleash the inner beast that resides within all White European Christians and do my part for humanity Once I get bored from ousting the filthy Turkomans from Constantinople not giving it back to Byzantium because ♥♥♥♥ orthodoxyPope 1 forever babyget rekt bearded priests I can turn my furious and just gaze across the Atlantic and kill lots of savages not my fault those filthy natives were living on Burgundian Florida Soon the whole world will be swathed in Burgundian colorsor all thats actually worth ruling not ruling Africa because lets be honest its Africa and lots of Zulu rebellions plus Zika mosquitosso you can actually smell the oppression while you relive the greatest period of time of all time The period when white people discovered the world and decided they didnt like itim starting to get the basics of the gameEver read a history book and thought I can do better Do you have high functioning autism Are you afraid of women This might be the game for youThis game is a black hole which will consume you entirely Youll find yourself answering questions about geography and history with ease while lesser mortals cry with confusion Youll be watching a quiz show and youll remember somthing ridiculous you didnt even think you were taking in Fantastic titleI wont say if they are worth it or notthats opinion basedyoull want the ones belowAfter finishing the tutorial just now I feel like Im ready to start the adventure that is Europa Universalis IV Whilst some companies face a period of decadence and incompetenceParadox

1,Rejoice Youve lived long enough to see Halo 3 on PCI was never able to play this on console do to my disability but with the MC collection on steam I can enjoy every minute of all the campaigns i never got to playHalo never diedit was just missing in actionThey brought Halo 3 to pc Enough to make a grown man cry700700 Achievements Never doing that again Just play the gameokThe only thing missing are my friends whove been afk for 8 yearsIts 2010 Me and the boys launch Halo Reach for the first time ever as we put Halo 3 back in its case We play invasion and then jump onto forge world Forward to 2011 me and the boys are high ranks Dominating any game we enter together We then establish a large group of players to play custom games with We played a lot of just Fat Kid lol But then the game mode infection came out And me and the boys suited up and played that game mode for 2 years straight Its 2013 Most of the boys go silent Few play Halo Reach Some jump on to Halo but it isnt the same Slowly but surely me and including the boys go silentbu TLDRu b Finally finish the fight on PC after 13 years of waitingthe level design can sometimes become repetitive Especially on the library mission The remastered visuals look nice but I find that it deviates way too much from the original vision of Bungie You can switch between the old and new graphics with a press of a buttonId give this game a bi Wort Wort Wort out of 10 with a slight slight tinge of heresy ibHalo ODST takes place during the events of Halo 2 and follows a squad of Orbital Drop Shock Troppers that get deployed to New Mombasa It uses the same engine as Halo 3 and so the fidelity isnt much a leap from Halo 3 but the art style is drastically different and takes on a noir style with washed out colors Kinda reminds me a little bit of Deus ex Human Revolution tbh Even more so because of its semi open worldhub designthis game was the first to release for the MCC on PC and quite frankly the port was not very good It had audio issuesvisual degrades when increasing resolution and many more problems However33 have already corrected many of these issues and now it is a great port to PC Reach takes place before the events of Halo Combat Evolved and is a prequel to the entire series It puts you into the shoes of Noble Sixa member of Noble Team that are tasked to well I wont spoil everything here Just know that youre stepping into some shoes the rest of the squad would rather leave unfilledthe mantle was given to 33 industies by Microsoft to carry on the legacy of Halo The very first game by 33i came as Halo  and would be a direct sequel to the conclusion of the Halo trilogy in Halo 3the change in art stylelevel design and gameplay loop I will just call this change differentFirefight and Spartan Ops h1finding matches has not been a problemBig Team BattleCapture the flag and such but there are also interesting and odd game types which are a good change of pacethere is a battlepass system in place where you can unlock various cosmetics such as armor partsgun skins and vehicle skins for each gamethe system is completely free and you dont miss out on previous seasons as they are all accessible indefinitelywhich is a great decision on their partthen Halo Reach and Halo 3 ODST have a mode called firefight where you have to fend off wave after wave of enemies with changing modifiers or mutationsa game mode exclusive to Halo  It is a cooperative campaignyou can solo where you get to use your customised spartan from multiplayer Keep in mind that although there is a set narrative herethe quality of production in spartan ops is nowhere near the level as that of the main Halo  campaignfirefight and spartan ops are solid addictions to the already superb collection of 6 campaigns The only thing missing right now is a custom server browser which I believe is in the worksHalo Combat EvolvedHalo 2 and Halo 3 DHalo 3Halo Reach and Halo Halo MCC allows you to open the game in anti cheat free modewhere you can install and play community created modsmod tools for Halo Combat EvolvedHalo 2 and Halo 3 have been addedyou must be thinking to yourself why did you read all of thatwhy did I write all of thisThere are those who said this day would never come What are they to say nowIts Halo but on your computerI knowiam late than never rightIve been dreaming of having an xboxyou know finishing the fightthat dream never come truesince i can make my own moneyHALO  comingI remember when I was young I really wanted to play Halo 3 and Reach so much but I didnt have an Xbox 360 that was over a decade ago now and both these games have launched on PC here on MCCReach has been good to meWARNING In order to download all of the games in the collection DO NOT use the in game menu to do so It constantly fails and only downloads maybe one thing you selected To download everything you wantjust go into the properties in your steam libraryclick on DLCand then select what you want This is the only frustration free way of doing itall my friends are so much betterbut that doesnt stop my love for the series I remember the days of oldOG Xboxsleeping over at my best friends house every weekend to beat Halo 1 COOP Then Halo 2 came outand we would beat Halo 1 then 2 COOP over night Then Xbox 360 came out with Halo 3 So then we played Halo 12 and 3 COOP Sadly I have to move away before ODST came outbut by then the 360 was out of courseand we could play Xbox Live with voice chat The new coming era of online gaming kept me and my best friend playing halo together for years to comeeven with an entire country now between us This is the beautiful story that so many of us share with Halo Friendships and Needlersand now playing it on a pretty beefy PC in 10pit looks amazing Just how your brain tries to think you remembered itwithout any polygons But of course you can press a button and bring it back and forth to see how it really lookedvs how your mind painted it in modern graphics for youGot called the N word on Halo 3 the other day War never changesI am sincerely sympathetic for any living being who did not grow up with this gameeven if youre a campaign only boy like methis is still some amazing valueIt was only a dream to imagine Halo coming back to PC and now it has come true The Master Chief Collection definitely succeeds but is still a tiny bit rough around the edges in some aspects No major issues in my experience such as crashes or startup problems My biggest gripe is that you cannot crouch while moving which feels very off The framerate appears greathowever100 FPS here doesnt feel as quite as smooth as 100 in other games Havent quite figured out as to why that isor if its just mebut my eyes adjusted anyway I remember putting in many hours into Halo Custom Edition Combat Evolved years ago so Ive been looking forward to thisI have been a big fan of the Halo series since CE so I may be a bit biased but yeahonestly dont wouldnt even wait for it to go on salenot really regularyou need to play  million mp matches just toor slowly go up depending on what level you areeven if its over commsWell its halo
1,Give PC next gen PC is beyond the specs of PS5 and the new Xbox dont see why we dont have the next gen experienceki dont understandnor does the entire PC community who decides to waste their hard earned money on this game It is to no surprise that the PC community has the best specs So that begs the questionwhy isnt NBAk on PC running at the nextgen version It makes zero sense Zero It is an absolute disgrace and insult to the entire fan base that you guys surprisingly still have on PCPC players want nextgen We not only want thatbut we want to be treated like you guys actually care about all of us who play your game I feel let down And you all should feel let down too for allowing your PC players to be stepped on like this Do betterget betterWelp This is it Been a die hard fan since k13 and im honestly done So fed up I honestly cant convey my frustrations No next gen on pc Ok i understand thatmaybe they had a deal or something with microsoftsonybut to play this piece of recycled garbage they call a new gameblasphemousIm disgusted and if there was a way to get my money back i would Quit focusing on your stupid fucking cosmetics and in game clothes u dumb fucklers Focus on the actual gameplay not if u have the new lowtop Travis Scott jordans WHAT THE FUCKDO NOT BUY THISthis isnt a ooh lets boycot k till they fix the game type of thing There are genuine reasons why you shouldnt buy this gamethis is a carbon copy of itwhile the next gen have a completely different badge system We get the same labelssurebut the way you get them 100 differentin nextgen its a whole different gameand k1so even this dont really countbut the same old systemand not k1and you wanna get it or whatevergo ahead But I 100 recommend you either get k1 on a discount if you gonna play that singleplayeror just get the game on consolesgo aheadSteam players should have the next gen console version of the nbak this is bsI bought NBA K 75th Anniversary Edition which gave me 105000 VC I created a MyPlayer and started MyCareer and after doing so I went straight to progression and spent the VC on attributes which then increased my overall from a 60 to an 80 Next I went to neighborhood and was just wondering around and trying to explore and I came across this door which happened to be the elevator I noticed that it led to different rooms so i decided to join the v3v3 room but in the midst of me trying to join it gave me an error message or something like that and sent me to the main screen I didnt make a big deal of it because I know the game is new and still needs more work done to it SoI enter MyCareer again only to find out that it didnt save automaticallymy MyPlayer was back at a 60 overalland I didnt have my VChow the fuck is a PC the old generationCurrent gen a LGive us next gendont waste your money on VCI played it for 10 mins and wanted to kill myselfThe game is pretty simular to the last  copies of it  It is definetly better than k1 thank god lol but stillI cant see this as actual progress PC not being recognised as next gen is killing the community and I honestly cant be anything more or less than sad Its just sad Its difficult but its coming out of a big K fandont buy this gameTHEY NEED TO RESPECT PC GAMING AND MAKE THE GAME NEXT GENK is just the worst company they dont care about their game or communityWe want nextgenI didnt realize that the PC version of the game is considered currentlast gen by k and thus has multiple features stripedoften for seemingly arbitrary reasonsk0 version 3money vacuum pay to win scam pc is current gen apparentlySo you buy a beast of a PC and see new NBA game being released You hear about it all being next generationmind blowing thing Basically Cyberpunk 077 for sportsbased on all the hype around it You are absolutely wrongmy friend This game was done ONLY for nextgen consoles This isnt even a new game for PC Comparing it to Cyberpunk 077 like I diddoesnt do it justicebecause I enjoyed Cyberpunk on PC Yes it had bugsbut it was a beautiful gamelets just say that ALTF4 will become a close friend of yours before you pass that first college game test Rest of the games are easy thereafterwhich makes perfect sensebecause youre going to top 16top8semis and final and it doesnt get more difficult therebut rather counterintuitively  becomes somewhat easierthe game is sooooo much k1 that your mycareer character is sometimes istill called Juniori ffsas it randomly lags in online 3v3 games with annoying stutterings all aroundas you upgraded and going back to k1 doesnt make much sense eitherimagine paying 60 dollars for a game that looks like its version from last year which looks like his version from last yearcant be me rightSame game as last year but if I dont buy it they shut the servers off of the last version and previous owners are left in the dark Not to mention their excuse for keeping lastgen on PC boiled down toWe want to focus on console players even though PCs can handle the graphical upgrade better than nextgen consolesk still does not have an ANTICHEAT measures
1,The game itself is real good Could be goodthat isif it wasnt literally strangulating you on your very step with LIMITS on every breathwhere you feel like in worst f2p if you dont subscribe to premium accountyou will be ultimately drown in crafting meterialswhich overflow your meager storage chest and overencumber you almost instantlybut theres a LIMIT on cash you can get per day shared between all vendors in gamewhich weights tonsbut useless for you You can sell them for lottery scrips for a small chance to win something more usefuland guess what There is a LIMIT on those scrips you can get per dayso the burden drastically increases every dayif you play at least semiactivelybut at least it increases with your levelingso its acceptable But You can build a good big housewith an underground personal vault and all you can store there is one aforementioned meager chest Noyou can build tens of differentlooking storage chestsbut they all share that same meager storage spacenor there is a point for you to sell anything to another player Everything nice comes via barter only on thirdparty internet resources Should I mention that cash LIMIT overflows real fastlike on total scrips or gold amountbut those can be managedand not a problem to me at least for nowthere are workarounds to do sobut they are unsafeor require to use help from OTHER PLAYERSIts weirdbut thenbut thenbut thenbut theninteresting enemies and the board game thingybut thenbut thenbut thenbut thenbut thenI really do But it just doesnt workA few days ago I received an email from Bethesda customer service It said that my Fallout 76 account had been suspended for cheating They pasted in a couple of paragraphs from the code of conduct that said no use of third party cheating software was allowedwhich they only respond to about once a dayIt would not accept my password I clicked on the “I forgot my password” linkwhich did nothing I was not able to reset my password until the next dayFallout 3Fallout New VegasFallout and now Fallout 76I received an email stating the followingit has been determined that the account did in fact violate our Code of Conduct  We regret to inform you that your appeal for an account ban reversal is denied due to the evidence within our system for Cheating  Exploitation enabled via a thirdparty program   This account is no longer eligible to participate in Fallout 76 due to the offenses on this accountit has been decided that this account will remain  ineligible to participate in Fallout 76 permanently This decision was not made lightlyand it is final”This is a great game But Im giving it a negative review for one reasonin which you can buy insanely overpriced cosmetics through microtransactions in a 0 gameyeahand Bethesda have ignored this for more than a year only to offer a monthly subscription allowing you to pay 15 dollars a month ifor unlimited junk spaceithat it would crash servers Fallout 1st proves that that was bullshtso you always can unload your items if you get overencumbered while exploring The fact that I could not enjoy the game after 60 hours without Fallout 1st is bad Really bad No game should be like thisI became a big fan of Fallout  after my grandson talked me into getting the game I delayed on Fallout 76 for the price to drop and to insure PVP wasnt an issue not a fan And I have to say there are a lot of positive things with Fallout 76 I also waited for them to do major updates etc I do enjoy the missionlengthy though they be Im a slow player almost 70 years old  Having to move around servers for camp emplacement is a pain but I understand whysonot too bad Building isnt quite as much as in Fallout  though you can do a lot as you choose I do wish combat was more along the Farcry 5 typewhere you had the chance to truly sneak into a camp and remove the baddies But overall if you are a Fallout  fan you should enjoy this game Graphics are goodthey corrected a crashing issuecontinue to add content and changes and supports different styles of play I dont pay extra for Fallout 1st monthly fee which gives you some nice benefitsand while I could afford itwell I havent paid a monthly subscription since my wow days Like most games some of the missions are tedious but there are lots of eventsdailies etc to mix up game play So I do recommend it being an overall Fallout fan Happy gaming allbe kindTo start with Im a huge Fallout fan and have been from the very beginning Ive played all the games and loved them Including questionable endings But when Fallout 76 came out it was obvious from the beginning that Bethesda had done something very wrong so I avoided it like the plagueh1TLDR at the endh1this is my opinion and you might disagree and probably will But opinions are opinionsif you enjoy Fallout 76kudos to youI love it when people are happy with their time spent on X or Yfar from it HeckI would say its the worse Fallout experience out there Even after almost 3 yearsits still kind of a mess Gamebreaking bugs Not that I have encounteredbut lots and lots of other inconveniencessuch as frame dropsserver issuesinventory managementclunky combatmissing itemsgetting out of boundsplayer interactionsetceven if you have the recommended requirements expect fps drops in some open world areascombine that with clunky combat and you have one hell of a combination Indoors instances are fine for the most part looking at you daily ops So if you look at the minimun requirements and believe it will run at 50ish fps obviously depending on your specs youre wrongits probably 2030be prepared to struggle If I have to dig into the game files to fix performance issues we are doing something wrongfor the most part they are Sometimes enemies tpsometimes you tpsometimes it disconnects you just becausesometimes it can rewind your progress granted it only happened once and it was just minutes of desyncdidnt lose anythingjust had to do a step on a quest again It clearly struggles to keep up with everyoneit might look like it at the start and you might go ¨pppfff this wont get full anytime soon¨ ooohhh but it will and when it does Its hell Welptime to scrapsell weaponsarmor if you want to keep the sweet sweet junk with you Even your characters weight limit is awfuleven if you have max Strengthmax carry weight perkslower weight of X item perks Youre still gonna get overencumberedyour inventory will sit at a nice 29250just as an example So its about collecting junk until the limitscrap it on your CAMP and repeator you would repeat if it werent because your stash will eventually be full as I mentionedits either good or meh at best And here its pure meh Let me elaborate further it plays like F or even F3 but it sure as hell doesnt feel as good 60 of the guns in this game are just boringyou got your standard pistolsassault riflesshotgunssniper riflesgamma gunslaser gunsmelee weaponsetc They all feel plastickytheres no weightthey sound boring What Im trying to get to is that they do not distinct from each other Its just a bad gunplay overrall What about the other 0 Its actually really really good When you start getting the late game guns its a whole different experienceand thats also an issue Difficulty in this game is everywhereits either hard just because or too easy oneshot everythingish And for some peopleincluding methats just not engaging after the 1253th time Weapons have durabilitycheckammo management is therecheck While annoying as it isits Fallout after alltheres always something thats on top of the food chain And thats fine But if that means some weapons are just not reliable at all cough bows cough why have them in the first place Also give love to laser gunsiI got that slightest chance I lost legendary armor part of my build and a whole set of PAbelieve in thatits been an issue for a long time now Theyll just ignore your ticket and move onbecause from their perspective youre a liar going out for free stuffsome do and doesnt do anythingcan you guess which one I wasthis is just a small thing that probably wont affect you but hear me out As a fellow Vault Dweller Cannibalits so annoying eating your victims and puuf falling through the ground It may not happenbut the chance of dying in the middle of nowhere and having to sprint like crazy for your loot is just annoyingI dont care¨ Then why are you playing an online Fallout game You might as well go to New Vegas and have one hell of a ride therethe world is just hugeeeeee and also empty NPCs cant carry the emptinesstheyll just stand there and repeat the same two linesand when you finally find somebody it usually goes likebe prepared to struggle too Maybe adding a whole PVP dedicated server would fix itbut Bethesda doesnt care about PVPthey did try with Nuclear Winter the Battle Royale mode but we all know how that turned outCAMPs are amazing Its crazy what other people can do with such a limited builder and the best interactions with someone will happen on your or their CAMP The community is friendly 90 of the timeso dont be afraid to salute a fellow dwellerI still like this gamebut I cannot defend it at allon the countrary I will give it all the hard love it needs just to be better And thats about itmy main issues with F76theres stuff I didnt talk about like seasonsor the terrible writting or quests in general I also didnt mention the perk systemwhich makes the combat way more enjoyable once you get the hang of a buildis it better now Yes100 Does that make it a good game NoIts mediocre at bestif you have the reference of what a Fallout game has to have then youre probably gonna have lots of  issues with it Newcomers to Fallout in general should be fine but believe me when I say theres a better product out there This game is the worse first impression youre gonna get of the franchiselackluster multiplayer experienceboring gun playdumb difficulty scalingperformance issues and many othersits not worth the full price tagnot even those Deluxe editions And please dont support Fallout Firstits a joke all though its your moneydont listen to this crazy girlWhat if I told you that the endgame in Fallout 76 requires you to build a team of  and scatter about the map looking for 2 time sensitive encrypted key fragments After finding themyou sit down together and decrypt a complicated and specific code that allows you to launch a nuclear missile onto the playable map Feeling accomplishedyour team gets together to assault one of the nuclear missile silos in an attempt to do your first launch You spend a majority of your resources finding ways through this highly classified military facility and fighting off hordes of powerful robots When you finally launch the nukeit temporarily alters the playable map to a much crazier state When you travel therea giant boss appears Already drained of most of your resources from clearing the siloyou fight with all youve got and scrape by to barely defeat the mighty enemy in time You and your buddies claim awesome loot and talk about how you cant wait to do it again in a week or so after youve built up more materialsits the same code for everyone Soloyou clip through the front door of the missile silowhich causes the game to not trigger any enemiesand immediately launch without fighting anything significant The nuke lands and does nothing to the terrain except change the color of some plants The boss spawns and you fire on itbut some random player with a hacked weapon kills it nearly instantly before you do enough damageso you get no rewards 10 minutes later you launch another nuke only to lag out in ground zero because enemies are endlessly spawning under the ground You eventually kill the boss and get basic items that you could loot practically anywhere else in the worldI feel like this would literally be one of the best games of all time But because almost every experience is bastardizedI cannot recommend this game to anyone I have sunken numerous hours into this game because I play video games 27 Please do not let my hours fool you into believing that this game is for you I enjoy parts of Fallout 76dont get me wrongbut I wouldnt expect anyone to overlook the issues I have outlinedA bad wastelander stole the weaponsplansoutfits and ammo that I had in my stash due to a vending machine bug or exploit that is years old I contacted the overseer and items will not be restored Good times That is allDont get me wrongthe game has improved since launch and is worth picking up on sale It is fun to play up to a point Once your junk starts limiting your stash you spend way too much time organising your inventorylimiting how much fun you can haveBethesda has a solution the Fallout 1st subscription The fact that theyre selling unlimited junkthe feature that would make everyones time in the game more enjoyableforces me to give the game a bad review unless they give the scrapbox the everyone They should have better incentives rather than an essential featureI really enjoyed this game until I get to the point when my inventorystash limit intruded between me and funyoure tied with a limited stash in terms of economy balancefor a monthly feetheyre ready to forget about this principle and provide you with an unlimited junk stashyoure required to heavily manage your inventory instead of having fun Its a freemium model in a paid gameyoull be locked with the same activity as when you were at the beginning excluding completed questsjust a remake of daily challenges  group expstat bonus while theres still no ingame chath1Season 3 just startedso you might thinkthat Bethesda had enough time to fix their gameright In meanwhile they managed to implement paywall similar to what you can find in F2P gamesso that mean game is working like it shouldright WellNOand I am writing this reviewto warn as many people as possibleso they wont pay for this broken software Amount of positive reviews this game got nowis literaly incomprehensible Especialy when we consider technical side of whole experience and how ugly this game ish1because Bethesda produces computer games and notfor examplesoftware for respiratorswhere what I just said is a reality and everyday lifeespecially when we consider its 2020 right nowbecause in the end our lives are not in dangeronly mental side of our health is somehow exposedbut in this case solution is simple  just dont buy Fallout 76no matter how big discount isno matter how much Todd Howard is waving at yousmilingtelling you that it just works and you should try it on your ownyou shouldntbecause this whole thing is simply not workingand I started playing it when it was launched on Steam I got baited by positive reviews pretending game is now fixedand its safe to buy itits not and never willbecause engine used to make this Fallout is simply too broken and too old to handle multiplayer gameand Bethesda is pretending that theyre fixing thembut in reality every single fix is bringing back old bugswhere in endgame you will face bug every two minutes I could make a very long list of bugs and other problems players facebut it would be just too long and its hard to guess which bugs are active nowbecause like I said previously  Bethesda mastered bugs rotation in this gameand you run trough early game in 60fpsthen in endgame you will have 30fps with regular stutters It is like thisbecause amount of items you carry and store in stash directly affects your framerateand to be honest Ive never seen something that much broken in any other game Fallout 76 in a nutshelland in this case first thing coming to my mindis community this game has People are friendly and very helpfulthey will explain everything you want to knowno matter how long it will take They will craft gear for yougive you materialshelp with questsbuild structures you cant build on your own yetfanaticstrolls and sectlike minority To understand what I am talking aboutyou can just browse Steam forums of Fallout 76 for 5 minutes and youll see it on your own Why I am mentioning them I am doing this only because Bethesda is doing nothing about problemthey are allowed to keep offending and attacking people who dared how dare they to criticize Bethesda Theyll keep striking on you and reporting your postsand you might end up warnedbanned for speaking your opinion in mannered way YesBethesda has their own freedom of speech standardsand its very close to what you can face in Peoples Republic of Chinaand then you can use them to get buffs for your character Great idearight In theoryyesbut you have to use each item for 050 seconds to recieve specific buffso if you want to get all of them you waste 5  minutes of your timeand one hour later you have to repeat whole process Everytime you want to craftrepairbuild you have to manualy change your perks loadoutwhich takes a lot of your timeand when youre done you have to manualy switch to your main build Bethesda promised to implement perk loadouts system months agobut its not just about that The thing isthat whole perk system lack any logic and common sensebecause perks should be splitted into two categories  active and passiveand crafting ones should not steal slots When you want to buff yourself using items from your inventoryyou have to scroll trough whole menu to find them one by one Every few questseventsyou have to do general cleaning of your inventorybecause game keep throwing useless and heavy stuff at you as reward Every single system this game has is unintuitivefrustrating and not rewardingand every simple thing you want to do takes ages to completebecause you discover new places while hikingdo various questsand simply enjoy it But this phase ends pretty fast when you hit midgamewhere grind begins and you realize how many limits this game has In order to reach endgame you have to grindeveryday How much you can store is limitedhow big you camp can be is also limiteddaily questsdaily currency gaineverything is made in a way to make sure youll play game everyday to reach your daily capand make just a slight or no progress at all Everything from events on map to daily quests is repetitive and boringwhere player feel hounded and forced to play everyday in order to reach daily limitsand if someone play everydaythat mean theres higher chance he will spend real cash to get additional stuff or to buy premium Fallout 76 preys on basic human instinctsthe desire to show offbeing noticedgeneraly speaking  need to be cool in other people eyes Everything in this Fallout is built like a wall surrounding all these behaviours and feelings They might tell youthat you dont need all that stuffbut believe meyou want it Thats how human brain works Atomic shop is a masterpiece when it comes to psychological manipulationfake feeling of items availability being limited by timeso you have to buy them before theyre gonediscounts lasting for limited timegreat deals for premium owners Atomic shopseasonsgame mechanicsboring dailyweekly challengeseverything this game offers in the end has just one common goal  to make sure youre attached enough to play everydayso at some point you might start thinkingthat it wont be a crime if you spend additional money to make your ingame life easier and more colorfuland theres nothing wrong with that But this is paid gamenot some F2P title for android Its also impostant to mentionthat every new feature like the newest thing available in game  shelters is hiding 90 of new content and fun behind a paywall Bethesda is literaly moving border to see how far they can goand how much they can earn before this  fountain dries upjust think twice before you give them to BethesdaYes Have been playing this game for nearly 3 years and like its predessesorsit is the shortest amount of time I have spent on a game over such a long period Fallout  was nearly 2600 hours and Fallout 3 was 818 hours over the course of a year I find these games a challenge at 60 years of agebut immensly rewarding I recommend this game to anyone of any agedont let that be a barrier I started with original Atari and N6 computers and the industry has come such a long way over the last 0 yearsGive it at least 100 hours of gameplay to really get the true experience Sureits had a few bugsbut overallhas been good value for money I live in New Zealand Kia Ora2018  👎Fallout Worlds is an absolute joke Just give us offline words we can mod like any other bethesda game and stop making us pay for something that would take you 30 seconds to add to the game Its a fucking jokeIve played through most of the games story nowgotten to level 50gotten to the Officer On Deck quest and well I gave up Entirely And its because of one reason The fucking stashboxbecause if you like hoarding resources in this game Like you do in Fallout  when base building then sorry buckaroobut your box will become more full than a hentai character during a fucking gangbang with three Deathclaws As soon as it got full and I had like 20lbs of screws on me that I couldnt depositbecause for some fucked reason the junk weighs more than it does in Fallout I immediately realized what the true purpose of Fallout 1st wasthen sell a solution for it YesI know I am basically beating a dead horse at this point but seriouslywhat the actual fuck Bethesda Do I look like the kind of fucking person who would want to spend 15£ a month just so I can get infinite scrap storage The scrapbox should be fucking FREE I dont care if you need to fucking kill the Scorchbeast Queen 6920 times or some shit to unlock its blueprintI can entirely saywith all my heartfuck this game Im done with itif you leave a comment disagreeing with me and saying the game is amazing and your only argument for that is insultsIm just gonna delete it I dont really like getting notifications from those types of people If you are gonna just disagree with me or say something I got wronggo right ahead Just dont be a dick about itaightgreat game now with the update but its BS that anyone has to pay 10 dollars for storage in a fallout game idc its online its fallout unlimited storage is a given even if it was one time 99 cents that would be ok but a freaking subscription is nuts I will not pay for it and noone should either just straight predatoryI initially started playing this game during the first BETA sessionand have about 2500 hours logged in total  The game has had its ups and downs in the years since launchand it isnt as outright bad as a lot of reviewers and journalists may lead you to believe  It genuinely has its good moments and has improved significantly since launch  The community is generally very friendly and will often go out of their way to help newer players with resources and adviceas a longtime player I cant say I would recommend it to anyone that hasnt already played it  The countless bugs and design flawsthe everincreasing layers of monetizationand Bethesdas apparent resistance to genuinely listening to the community and glacial pace of responding to major issues make it difficult for me to give this game a positive review  Bethesda doesnt exactly have the greatest track record with this game eitherbut I wont go into detail about issues that were already fixed in the past such as the inventory steal hack and just focus on the problems I currently have with the gamesuch as the infamous damage bug where if you deal too much damage with certain weaponsall ranged weapons stop dealing damage until you relog  This happens most often with some of my favorite weapons such as the Tesla Rifle and Plasma Flamerand it happens often enough that I may have to relog multiple times per play session just to fix this issue  Leaving a server means Ill often miss out on legendary items and rewards from events and other ingame activitiesand it becomes infuriating very quickly  This issue is what drove me off from playing the game for the majority of 2020and Im sad to report that this bug is still happening now after I decided to briefly give it another chance at the time of this reviewyou can only earn up to 100 vendor caps150 scrip200 gold bullionetc per day  These limits feel very restrictive because its very easy to stock up on far more loot than these limits allow for you to reasonably spendso youll end up with massive piles of heavy legendary items and loot that may be difficult to offload in your player vendors unless youre extremely active in the trading community  This can discourage you from even playing the game until your limits reset the next dayso even if youre somehow enjoying your time with the game in spite of all the bugs and odd design decisionsyoull feel forced to log out to keep all your hardearned loot from going to waste if you dont want to just dump it on the groundor spend 20 minutes doing tedious inventory management to get your stash box below its maximum capacity  Just buy Fallout 1st and get infinite junk storagea feature that shouldve just been freely available in the game to begin with  Even some of the microtransaction CAMP items dont function properly half the time  They often have glaring issues that even a few moments of playtesting would make apparentyet theyre still put on the Atomic Shop  Not to mentionthis new season system has removed daily and weekly Atom challengesso once your nonrepeatable Atom challenges start drying up your only free method of earning Atoms will be at predetermined intervals in the season systemgamebreaking bugs like the damage bug that have been in the game since launchthey continue to add broken new features that barely work and then immediately turn around and ask you to give them even more money for it  Just save yourself the hassle and play something elsegame is cool and allbut the performance is not heres a quick guide to make your game run betterand set iPresentInterval0 in Documents\my games\Fallout

FPSit may ask you to restart the gamethe presets also changes some extra settings the user cant access from the games graphics optionsWater  Lighting to the max settingsbut leave all other sliders aloneLets get this out of the way first Is this game better now       Yesit released buggyboring and left a bad taste in everyones mouthweaponsclothingCAMP itemsnew areasnew creaturesnew featuresand most importantly Quests with compelling NPCs and a storyline that didnt have you chasing ghosts Dialogue that hearkens back to the Fallout games predating s controversial dialogue system With replayability and choices that actually effect the main storyits lore was explained in a believable way that was obviously thought out and they tried their best to work with the existing lore to make it happen While it may be controversial to some Lore aficionadosits nice seeing a fan favorite faction worked within a new title rather than having to skip out on them due to lore reasons It also adds new questsNPCsweaponseventsallies and your own personal miniature vaults called SheltersA Seasonal ScoreBoard that mimics that of a Battle Pass to unlock free stuffDaily OpsDaily EventsChallenges to earn Atoms for freeand Public Teams that give you exp bonuses along with other buffsthe Battle Royale mode that you can go into with friends or alone rank upwin exclusive armor and CAMP items for the Adventure mode and any exp carries over to your character in the Adventure modewhile not for everyoneis completely optionalnever feels like its forced on youand all of its contents are MOSTLY cosmetic and usually are all pretty damn cool stuffIll explain the existing ones in questionits only saving you a few seconds that you could normally do for free anywaysor you can repair them yourself and most objects have relatively low costs to repair that might only take you one trip to a random building to find the needed materials anywayshe doesnt gather much And usually only finds a handful of things that are commonly found in that area You can just as easily take over any workshop in the game for free and have one of them generating you junk that generates way more junk over time and at a much faster rateor one may make it to where you can jump higher for an hour Though I think there is one that gives you 5 extra exp for one hourbut you can lay down in a bed for 15 seconds and get an extra 25 exp for an hour in the game for free anywaysit preserves your food for longer But with food and drink no longer being a complete necessity in the game meaning you no longer take negative side effects from being hungry or thirstyonly small buffs when you do eat or drink its an optional item for a now optional mechanicdiscounts on the Atomic Shopand 13 worth of Atoms You also get the Survival Tent this tent allows you to drop it where you please on the map and creates a free fast travel waypoint The Scrapboxprobably the most controversial item of them allwhich allows you to have UNLIMITED storage for your junk itemsit also breaks them down to their raw components for you And the Private World optionwhich essentially loads you into a server where only you and any invited friends can play You DO NOT have ANY options to mess withyou can not change anything about this servermost are completely optional for optional mechanics and are mostly just time savers EXCEPT the Scrapbox and Survival tentbut to be honest for 13 a month I feel as though you at least deserve something of substantial value Id say Fallout 1st is only for those who play this game a lot and want to save some timesecond to Oblivionsin my opinionand Fallout 12 and 3though usually not game breaking and wont disrupt your experiencejust goofymaking Nuclear Winter the only true way to experience PVP in the gamethere are more reused assets from Fallout  than Id likebut it was developed alongside Fallout  so I guess thats to be expectedbut after youve finished a handful of quests you are locked out of continuing until level 20 While leveling up to level 20 is not hard and will come quicker than you thinkit is really annoying to not be able to continue just when the story is picking up speed and getting interestingIll end it with thisplay thisespecially with a friendif you are one of those Fallout fans who thinks that Fallout New VegasFallout 1 and Fallout 2 were the best games in the series and that Bethesda is ruining the franchise and you want a TRUE single player RPG and dont want to be around anyone then No Dont get thisyou wont enjoy the changes made to some of the loreyou wont enjoy being around people and itll probably only fuel your hate for Bethesda moreit is essentially Fallout  but with a better mapbetter story and online features
1,Has a long way to go Needs more quest contentmore depthsome fixesadded character interactions and dialogue and alot moreits a modern warband after all But it could be much moreThis is my first review on steam ever I felt it was kind of my duty to give my opinion on the game that I have personally been waiting for over 6 yearsas Warband happens to be if not the one of my all time favourite games with around 1100 hours of gamplay  yes I knowstill rookie numbers compared to some other of its fansbut stillthats a considerable amount of my lifes timeI have as of now played 63 hours of Bannerlord and another 155 hours of the multiplayer beta of which I had the honor of being a part I now feel confident enough to talk about why I think that you should get the game yourselfespecially if you loved any of its previous titlesthe game is aesthetically a HUGE development from the awkward indie 2010 that even then still felt older graphicswhich we all grew to love The animations seem more realisticthe items more detailedthe campaign map is incredible and the scenery from the snowy forests of Sturgia to the desert wastelands of the Aserai homelandand from the rocky Battanian villages to the great cities of the Empire is beautiful and at times even dare I say majestic Surethe graphics still dont compare to the other big games of its timeand the character models still look a bit oddbut for a game of a small company like Taleworlds that chooses to focus more on the gameplay and the games mechanicsyou can at least overlook some of their flawsin a world where the Calradic Empire still existsalthough in crisisand new and old kingdoms arise in its wake Some of the factions are the ones that evolved into the ones in Warband Vlandia is the predecessor to the Swadians and the RhodoksSturgia is a mix between the Vaegirs and the Nordsthe Khuzaits are the khanate before the rise of the Khergitsand the Aserai the previous Sultanate to the Sarranidswhile we also have the Battanians a celticlike mountain kingdom and the Calradic Empire an empire very similar to the medieval GrecoRoman now known as Byzantine Empire Each of these factions is very well made in order to feel unique and different to the otherswith its own architectureclothing style and troopsthat are very close to their historical inspirationsgiving you a nice depiction of some fields of what the actual medieval world looked like and in some cases how it workedfor Single Playeron a first look youd say Thats an enhanced version of Warband and youd may be right for the most partbut the game offers many new features and details that differentiate it from its predecessor Examples of this are the many convenience optionslike the way you can recruit troops from villages and towns which can be more and better if you have good relations with the villages notables or the fact that you can see the full items stats and compare them to your own There are many new featureslike the Clan and its mechanics basically youyour family and your companionsthe fact that you can have children and continue to play as them once your older character finally kicks the bucketthe forging system which allows you to make weapons and choose how they will look on your ownthe new Kingdom Mechanicsthat enhance the experience of serving or ruling a realm with multiple armies and kingdom lawsand the fact that you can now kill nobles that you capturewith whatever consequences that may entail Other features have been renewedfixing annoying issues that existed in Warband or completely changing the way they worked for the betterlikefor examplethe new massive battles with more thought out AIplanningand the siegesthat now have siege weapons and are not just a mass of angry people cramming a small ladder only to get violently killed by the other mass of angry people that awaits them on the wallsthere are now 3 main modeswhich are Skirmish 6v6 which is like battle and conquest togetherCaptain 6v6 which allows every player to command a small band of troops and Siege which is the good ol siege we all know and lovepolished with siege weapons and some new mechanics There is also a Team Deathmatch mode which is more like a playground to prepare you for the real modes above Nowthe way the combat works is almost the same as in Warband with some minor changes like a shield bash movea crouch move and chain attacks and I feel like it is what we should expecteven though I hear complaints about it being clunky and unreliable I personally enjoy it as I did in Warband and Id say it is highly dependent on skill and experience I believe its hard to learn and to masterbut once you doit offers you a very fun and challenging experiencethere are still many issues and bugs which make you question the fact that this is a game that was in development for 8 years and that it is priced as much as it is If you buy it nowmind that you will come across a lot of them That being saidyou should also keep in mind that this is still Early Acccess and many of them are bound to change Alsoyou have to AT LEAST give credit to the developers for keeping track with the complaints and the feedback of the playershaving already made 10 updates during the first 1011 days since the release and continuing strong Honestlythe way they keep hunting for issues and bugs and the way they listen to negative feedback is all I could ask from a game studio whichagainis not a major one andif anythingdeserves my support in this journey of making the game that we all have dreamt and still dream ofthe game is a worthy successor to Warband It offers you a pretty similar experience that Warband did letting you explore a vast world of different cultures and giving you the freedom to make your own storywhether it is of the journeys of a merchantthe adventures of a warlordthe path of terror left behind by a bandit leaderor the rise of a new ruler which is exactly what we should all have expected and hoped for And yeteven as a game that offers content and possibilities the size and even significantly bigger than the size of Warbandit still feels like it has not even scratched the surface of what it is capable ofleaving space to be filled in ways that we havent even immagined by the many and various mods that are bound to follow and have already started making their entrance by the ever restless and creative modding community of MountBlade Soif you have waited for this game like I have and still wonder if you should buy it in its current state Id sayyesjoin this journeybecause even if its not yet all you have dreamt ofgiven time and support its going to be If you are new to MountBladeand think that it is a little overpriced for a game that is not fully completed yetyou can always wait until it comes out of EAbut I would personally recommend that you give it a goand in the end you will be glad you didWith 2192 hours in WarbandI think its safe to say that Ive experienced my fair share of the classic Warband experience that Bannerlord is not only trying to emulate but also build upon With 15 hours in the gameIm already of the belief that Taleworlds will not only achieve this endbut surpass ityes Some of the bugs are obnoxiousyes There are portions of content missing that are sorely needed Not only is this truebut the disappointment surrounding it is understandable After 8 years of waiting10 for somethis series has cultivated a cult following of dedicated and loving fansmyself very much includedwho want nothing more than to dive head first into the gamethe content included in the game is entertaining compared to Warbandcombat actually feels weightyand adventuring around Calradia has a heightened sense of danger and excitement to it Side activities such as smithing allow for those interested in roleplay to create deeper stories for their charactersand core mechanics such as trading have been developed and enhanced in this new release to feel far more responsive and rewardingcontent will be addedand I am firmly of the faith that the game will continue to evolve and take shape over the coming daysweeks and months Everyone is well within their rights to leave a negative reviewbut I would encourage people not to damage the games rating unfairlyas the current release is not indicative of the finished productand I cant wait to see that vision be fulfilledHad my entire fortune poached by wandering looteresmost of my men were killedthose who werent died later of starvation and the only one to make it to a town was me Where I was promptly ambushed by brigandswho let me go because I was too poor At some point I realized Id lived my entire life in povertymisery and eventually I decided to turn my life aroundcreated some minor works  barely making a profit Until one daywhen I made a sword that broke the towns economy Everyone wanted my sword In merely a dayId earned enough to purchase largess too grand for even kings Then my life  so deprived in years gone by  was filled but still empty Money begets moneyand violence begets violence Eventuallywhen I had conquered the world I knew nothing but stillness My clan was large and thus was my lot

that the next time im going to behead that lord and his entire family the first time we meet Until next timeShort version If there was a tentative recommendation buttonId be using it It very much depends on the personbecause while most people praise the gamethere is a serious contingent that have reasons not toI dont blame you It doesnt bother me as long as the first game is good in its own rightbut I can agree that we shouldnt have to buy a second game to get what was promisedbut there are plenty of bugs Ive seen I tried walking the streets of Baltikhand and had a CTD while loading them in I repeated the process to verify that the crash was a consistent thing So stay off the streets of that town and just hit the trade and recruitment screens there Im having issues with attribute points not being given to me at every third level like theyre supposed to be Im sure itll get fixed but as of this review I havent seen it happen Also having a hard time leveling up charm skill despite following the instructions given in the tooltip Not sure if its a true bugor if the tooltip isnt telling the whole story Ill have to wait and seeI adore what this game is doing with the series We have families now Not just a marriage for an alliancebut an actual clanwith potential for childrenand a brother built right into the story Were the head of a clannot just a nobody adventurer making it on their own Its very Crusader Kings II to meand Im loving everything I get intoand we can spend that influence to put laws up to vote that have actual impacts on the stability and power balances within our Kingdoms Being a vassal doesnt just have to mean warringwe can use our built in influence to do politics as wellI love it If youre on the fence and dont want to spend 0 or 50 dollars on it yetwishlist itwatch the patch notesand see how it looks when it goes on sale for real For the rest of youI understand the hate and dont blame you I just dont share itand I recommend anyone with an interest at least keep an eye on ittheyve done a lot of bugfixing Theyve also done a bit of fleshing out and adding in features I can definitely say Ive already gotten my moneys worth from itand Ive been YouTubing it as well It still suffers some problems from the old games so far The combat gets samey and isnt all that balanced There seems to be a big tendency toward telling things rather than showing them properand this isnt helped by gameplay and story segregation Though I could honestly see the gameplay and story segregation being intentional There IS a main quest chain with a story to itand theres room to interpret that quest as pretty much poking holes in a lot of the flavor text Againnot sure if intentional and if it is its not really that smart a move on their partbut its there if you want to read into itthis is definitely for you If notkeep watching or look into other gamesGreat game who need 1 or 2 years of development tldr mid game turn into a micromanagment hellone

or guard a territorythey do whatever they want if theyre out of your army  partyso you have to do it yourself Either youre leading your huge army to fight what is basically an enless war mid gameor you take care of your cities while the rest of your faction fight with various success Some commanders are pretty goodother will throw waves of recruits at highly trained arbalists in the open backed with cavalry Protip dont be a recruit in an imperial armyits up to youor the IA if it feel like it Worstif you let the parties you created roam around parties  group of 70200 soldiers under a lord they can be temporarily drafted in other armies of your kingdom and youll have to physically move to the armytalk to the leader and pay some reputation to get them back Of courselarge armies are slow This leads the the next problemswarmsits an army disbanded in the middle of my territory The small parties usually start raiding all villages in the vicinity while being too fast to be catched by a big army Raided villages impact your town  castle loyalty and gold quite heavily Sureyou could disband your army and hunt them yourself but that makes you take a step backand all your parties would reform under another army you cant control And mansome army commanders are reallyreally stupid Verdun style charge in the open against walls of archerscavalry in a forest vs pikemensyou name it I cant count the time i had parties wiped in someone else army But lets say you managed to capture the lords burning your villagesthey magically teleport to their hometownrebuild a fast 80 mens army in the blink of an eye and go back to raiding villages AI cheat with recruitsthey will always find soldiers in towneven if theyre empty for you Executions you sayno matter how much of an Ahole heshe isthe whole faction will hate you He raided dozens of villages and killed hundreds of peasants Still not good enough You just cant kill a lord without suffering heavy consequences down the lineand youll need those lords to be friendly later Worth to mentioncapturing the leader of a faction wont stop a warfollowed by 600 days of complete peace in the entire map due to a bug apparentlyand im now back at 300 days of war Not a single day of peacewhen one war stop another start immediatly They will just neverever stop fighting Cant catch a breathcant leave the front of your lose townsits really fun for a while but it need a HUGE QoL updateOne of the best War games Ive played plus I used Voiceattack for voice commands I felt like a field general lol wife thought I was nutsWait 10 more years for

Instead of getting autooffers from AIClans are hard to geteasy to lose and unfairly destroy relations This makes Kingdom almost impossibleand since money is not an issue atmits just sillythey do not autorecruitbut will get themselves captured and will waste valuable troopsbut sometimes are simply turning a siege into a field battleaka not much sieging gameplay if you simply break walls Opening gates from the inside is toughbut when it worksits silly and OP I also had a few crashes after siegesthere are just a fewand a ton of copypasteso not much interest in sieging the same castle again and againits extremely easy to get to around lvl 1315ishand then pfff XP requirements for companions are simply broken They will not lvl upnot this century at least You finish the game and they are still 12 lvls away from where they startedthat simply splits the game in either you do itplay a quickermuch simpler and more repetitive gamemake a ton of enemiespotentially ruin your characterruin diplomacybe forced to go down the genocide path and bypass any reason to siege or make a Kingdom Or not do itplay the long game of building good relations with the nobilitybut miss all the murdering funsecretly wish you could do itand cry yourself to sleep every night And end up in a mess with your Kingdom anyway The problem here is you can easily lamify the game by executing all nobles And instead of a juicyrewardingemotionally messy and mechanically complex end gameyou just chop chop chop chop chop THE ENDfocusbetter framingbetter organisationless cluttermore consistency and polish Upgrades are hard to figure out at firsta bit oddand the grey shield icons over the Skills that can upgrade are simply not visible enoughthey should be Colorful Bright Glowy Animated with a color that stands out Personally I prefer the grid structure of the Warband inventoryentirely uselessand poorly designed autosave doesnt async save in the background It freezes the game for a few seconds You cant turn it offdepending on how you play and what you may tryits essentialWish it had a Coop campaign so you could create a factionkingdom with a bud Great gameUpdate 1 620  Devs have been aggressively patching the game since release This is more than great news If they keep up the good work well probably have a fullyfeatured working game much sooner than anticipatedits buggyits mount and bladeits loveso buggy that you should not only save oftenbut also in multiple saves cause there are manymany gamebreaking bugs that force the player to start over if theres no other way to avoid loopholesbut also feels not properly tested too Several bugs and missing textures are noticable right from the start while the game is still on rails before moving onto the sandbox gameplay You just cant miss those things with even bare play testing To prove my pointi wanted to visit a castle to see how it looks like so i visited Sestadeim Guess what Sestadeim castle exterior was EXACTLY the Lycaron City This is just alpha materialok for a 2020 release Lighting kinda feels weird and fakebut thats just personal opinion Generaly im very pleasedits still very far from a steady release If youre ok with that and you think you have the stamina to replay the game several times untill its ready and then somethen get it cause its freakin awesome Its mount and blade 20 But if you think youll exhaust all your interest and youll soon burn out before the game comes into glorythen you maybe should wait for a while and see what happenstaleworlds will continuestart improve their game for the sake of everythingWish This had CoopThe game is still technically in early accessso there are a few things missing like endgame Kingdom functionality and some dialogue options for companionsbut overall its entirely playable in its current statethis game is a true successor that improves upon the previous game in several ways Those who are fans of the previous game will find much that is familiar to them here Proxies for different Western powers in the land of Calradiaeach with their own culturesstrengthsand weaknessesand the ability to aid or hinder them There are some quality of life improvements as wellsuch as the ability to speed up map time by 2x and food not rotting Towns and castles too feel much more fleshed outthough like in the previous games there is no real need to walk around them and you can avoid doing so the whole game given you never buy a workshopthere are some amazing additionsmost notably smithing which allows you to custom create weapons how you see fitand some others like siege weaponsnamely tournaments and trade Now tournaments provide unique items in addition to the gold you betand trade is much easier to get involved in and serves an important part of the beginning to midgame All in allmuch of the game has been smoothed over and polishedretaining much of the older Warband feel while still being an improvement in most areasthe combat For all the improvements to the base game mentioned abovecombat remains one ofif not the largest draw to the series I have to saythey did a damn fine job at it too The combat here is so SATISFYING Warband was funand it functions much the same herebut like everything else it has been improved upon Hits feel a lot meatier as you ride by and cleave someone in twain with a polearm from horsebackduels feel much more tense as weapon handling has been refinedand troop controls have been improved with the ability to select different formations as well as delegate troop command to the AI sergeants The battlefields look gorgeousalthough with noticeably repeating layoutsand the large scale battles are breathtakingwhere troop commands were present in previous games but not quite as fleshed out or as central as they are here The only thing I miss is the ability to tell troops to advance or retreat 10 pacesas well as the fact that the AI seems to have much more fine control of the troops than I can possibly managethe game is great so far As a Warband junkieit feels like much the same gameonly better in almost every way The economy feels more involvedgame mechanics more polishedand the combat more exhilaratingI feel like a lot of people here forget what Warband was like or how different Warband was compared to the original Mount  Blade Warband offered some added functionalitymultiplayerand something of a narrative but was effectively the same game as the original Even with the Diplomacy modthe marshal AI was atrociousmarshalling fickle AI lords was even worseand the limited amount of quests were far more than frustrating You cant pay me enough to herd zigzagging cattle to armiesto deliver inconsequential messages across the mapor to fight up and down 80 degree inclines ever againBannerlord is arguably the best medieval simulator on the marketmaking it more than worth its value at its current price point The influence system alone is a godsend No more dedicated marshals and no more soliciting every peer in the realm for votes Influence controls votespoliciesmarshallingand maintaining army cohesion I love itgiving your archers a line of sightusing your cavalry to harry and flankand maintaining infantry line disciplineespecially in battles with 800 men The maps make combat even better Bridgescresting hillsnarrow valleysriver crossingsrolling sand dunesand more Each of these terrain types demand different tacticsdead Ring a guy with your glaive and he spins around in the direction you struck him Fantasticapproached the Khergit heir afterwardsand proceeded as planned We have a kid now and his name is Junjadbut I affectionately refer to him as Junchad Ive only encountered one or two bugs that I couldnt work aroundwhich makes this earlyaccess release more than playable in my eyesbut they too need some work eg laddered siege towers are useless I suggest cracking walls with four trebuchets after racking them up in reserve for the best experienceI find the emergent gameplay qualities to be superb Ive rolled two characters first with the Battanians and now with the Khuzaits Ive adopted my own roleplay rules over recruitmentexecutionsand lofty ambitions each time and the game enables that I once got shot off my horse and was about to be swarmedonly to command my cavalry to sweep in and save my life as if I were Jon Snow Too much fun Ive noticed some women die from childbirthmaking lords bachelors again Feels like a realbreathing world Itd be nice though if lords and ladies killed each other every once in a whileseeing as they breed like rabbitsbut Im sure thats to comeTaleWords doesnt make any other games This is it With 100 employeesthe potential is there I wouldnt hesitate to buy as a former Warband player As a newcomer with different expectationsmaybe its worth waiting for the full release Up to you if you want to have fun now or laterso after my first 1 hours in gameI have decided that the early access has a really strong foundationcombat is excellent including horse movement and weapon usethe battles are excellent including formations and ordersSieges are much more improved from warbandwith the addition of optional siege equipment The towns feels alivethe factions are interesting and feel different culturallyit feels pretty freeand not too complicatedwith some nice benefits to putting time in to skills you are using in a way you enjoy the game anyway Trading is funand a good way to make some cashthough the economy needs work as a whole talked about belowas it just plonks you in the world alonewithout a main story much like Warbandthough the story is fun the first time desptire the tediousness of constantly getting repetitive questsis also amazing Getting a spousehaving childrenwatching them grow upstart families for themselveseventually dying of old age and having your child take over is very immersiveas its really overunderpowered depending on what you are currently making Though its necessary due to the belowit needs some work mechanicallyfor instanceallowing lords to join youdespite their clans intentions This could work either as the Lord forming a new clanor they are put in a rogue lord category until they are back in the same faction as the leader of their clanOR your council can just agree to pay a daily tribute to stop the fighting againwithout agreement from the enemy you are paying tribute tooor escape very easily without your say or ability to stop it This means that during a siege for exampleyou can defeat a lordcapture themthen have them come back with a new army during the same siege That is a mess You should be able to lock people up forever if you so want or at least only have it so another lord breaks them outor a tiny chance to escapebased on the security of the settlementthe early game is incrediblethe midgame is funbut the lategame only is really fun if you are a vassal Having your own kingdom just isnt fleshed out yetand instead having diplomacy work on merit and situation alone would improve the game tremendouslyIf youre deciding whether you should wait to buy the gameor go for it now it all comes down to how much perfection you expect from a game in early accessthere have been no crashesor major gameplay issues All issues seem to be visualwith the graphics not looking as good as the videos and promotional picturesbut still overall pretty good Minor other issuessuch as starting battles in first person and seeing the backs of your eyeseyebrows are the greatest problems Ive encountered Those are solved by switching from first to thirdthen back to first person so its not the end of the world by any stretch of the imaginationsave your money until a few updates come out and maybe invest it in some chill pills in the meantime If youre okay with a game thats perfectly playablethough a little rough around the edgesyou wont regret buying the game Overall Bannerlord is a massive improvement over the originals and Im very happy with my purchaseb Its almost harvesting seasonbthe balance is brokenand many systems are being worked on and implementedbut these issues that every Early Access game under the sun has pales in comparison to the sheer scopedepthscale and fun of the most ambitious Medieval sandbox game to release in the past decadeucrashesand broken balance as an early access
1,I would have reviewed this soonerbut that would mean leaving the factoryand the factory must growI started a coop factory with a close friend After a day of workI stepped backlooked at what we builtand came to some realizationsone of the machines producing copper cable for another machine to assemble into circuit boards is halfway across the god damn refineryand the rest are going so many directions this thing looks like a ball of yarnand every time it gets bigger it somehow becomes MORE labrynthine One of those fucking conveyor belts goes all the way around the entire factory to deliver steel plates to a single assembler thats making bloody gearsand its right next to the refinery itselfand the breaks we do spot are often half an hour old and are a recurring problem Rather than fix itwe simply unjam the machine and ignore it until it breaks again The biggest problem to fixing it comes from our production lines Normal production lines look like a grid Ours looks like you threw a bunch of squares into a bowl of spaghetti noodles and gave the bowl to a five year old for a period of one to five minutes This proccess results in either an empty bowl and a full five year olda floor covered in noodlesor spaghetti all over the walls and ceiling with the squares nowhere to be found Knowing the trend in increasing chaos and complexity the factory exhibitsprobably all

every corner of the planet is scoured clean The factory grows The planet will never be scoured clean The factory grows The planet is infinite in size The factory grows The game will never be overinsatiable in its hunger Though it had experienced full production stoppages in the pastthe factory could never be eliminated from the planet by the nativesfor the sun itself powered the beams of destruction that maintained its borders Within the creakingancient cogs and permanent haze of foul and polluted smokea single humanoid shape slowly rises to its feet Agedfailing flesh and bone long ago replaced with steel and chromeonce polished and cleannow weathered by uncountable years of exposure to acid rain and blackened by thickchoking smogform its excuse for a body It could have left while it was still humanbefore it was consumed in body by the foundry it created to escape It never had a chance to leavemind and soul devoured in the pursuit of freedom With slowclanking steps and the steady drip of oil from its jointslike a bleeding mechanical nightmare brought to hideous lifeit stands and rasps as it moves for the exit Behind ita thousand drones rise like a plague of locustsready to continue the endless harvest As the abomination that was once a man steps towards the gates of the factorya mighty space faring vessel lies decrepit in its dry dock deep within the core of the facility It was supposed to be a way off the planetthe whole reason for the factorys construction But soonthe building of the factory became the means and the endno thought other than the constant urge to grow in its mindhowling wind tears across the surfaceforests destroyed by the ruined atmosphere no longer keeping it in checkechoing forever on a planet overtaken by the machineThis game is extremely addictive for one simple reason its a sandbox survival game with zero grindbecause everything can be automatedto craft 1 itemsyou need to first harvest 1 of some resource In this gameyou set up a power planta coal mine to fuel the itan iron minea few assembly plantsa few conveyor belts and a chest and then wait for it to fill up with 1 grenades while you go work on another part of the factory Meanwhilethe increasing pollution makes the bugs native to the planet increasingly agitatedthen use robots to place them according to blueprintstransport items with automatic trainsand create complex control networks to let production adapt to demand There is always something to do with very little repetition  a sudden bug attacka bottleneck in your iron productiona depleted ore patch that forces you to explore for a new one People spend absurd amounts of time on this game because it doesnt waste any of itHelp for new playersyou dont Trust medont worryyoull have shortages later Get more ironuntil it isnt because you cant send enough material down the entire beltand theres no room to supplement it down the linestart storing extras in chests Youll need it laterIm out of copper Get more copperand build gear wheels and copper cables on site Its much more efficient than trying to transport themthere is automation for automation Flying robots Checkin which case they are notremove atomic bombs from your hotbar unless you want a very expensive mistake read hole in your factoryand it goes quicklyguaranteed  ahemcarsand the community is fantastic at sharing their different creations Try them outand then see if you have a better or more creative way to make something work if you wantor filter to only pick up certain types of items eg items laying on the groundor just small power polestheres a better way to build that Let me start over Againis that the sun coming up alreadyCrash landed on an alien worldothers lie defunct and forgottenburnt oiland death I take it in with a breathbut smell nothing My power armors filters purify allthat the combined sound of their repulsers almost drowns out the near constant drone of laser fire AlmostThis isnt so much a game as it is a digital Zen Garden Ive lost hours 4 apparently tweaking my factory Sometimes to make it look prettier Sometimes to rebuild it because I need space for yeah another stream of components Sometimes just because Ive approached Zen and dont want to give it upyoull create two more And once youve got everything working perfectlyYour factory will be stalled because of resource exhaustionspitters and bittersor a new production option changes your resource needs If that sounds like the kind of challange you enjoythis game will provide you rediculous value for your moneyTry crack It is probably less addictiveLook If youre a Software Engineer Just dont buy the game Youll be playing at 4am Tuesday morning wondering where hell the last 72 hours went and how you missed work on mondayFactorio is a puzzle game The objective is supposedly to build a rocket ship to launch stuff into spacebut most people never get that far because they noticed that the last few furnaces in their smelter line arent getting fed ore because the belt throughput isnt high enough so they need to upgrade the beltswhich requires more a lot more iron so they need to build more smelters and gear assemblers but then they start running out of iron so they need to build a new iron mine but there are bugs attacking their mining machines so they need to build turrets and ammunition and then they realize they need to get the ore from the new mine to their factory quicker so they need to build a trainbut then they need to do the same with their copper mine so they need to build a rail network that can cope with multiple automated locomotives without causing a traffic jam and they need to design rail intersections that dont allow crashes and then they realize that their power generation is starting to reach capacity so they need to upgrade their power plants so they decide to start using solar power but to use solar power properly you need batteries but to make batteries you need sulfur so they need to set up their oil refineries to make sulfur but then the heavy oil products are backing up because you have too much and you need steel production to build storage tanks and barrels for the oil but then you noticed that you dont have enough iron to make steel because your smelters are not running at full efficiency because there isnt enough belt throughputFantastic way to spend 2 or 3 thousand hoursworth every pennyThis game will rob you of your life8 full days of endless efficiency and growthThis game doesnt feel like a Early Access game at allits captivating Also frustrating when you thought something would work and it doesntthen you have to change your setupbut I still enjoy making my factory grow modestly Being attacked is an annoyance but wrecking the bugs nests feels gooduntil they counterattack and wrecks your shit backday after day And night after nightyou will dream of conveyor beltslots of conveyor belts Your dreams will become nightmares as you try to untangle monstruous spaghetti beltsgrowautomate small processgrowautomate bigger processgrow tomatoes waittomatoes No No need to worry about starving in this game Though you can find fishes in

their C guru that are programming the actual updatesthe team behind it deserves the recognition  its amazingthoughtuland incredibly well done because of themits similar to RTS games like starcraftwhere you build up and gather resources  But instead of spending 2 minutes to build up a base to have the game end in 2you keep buildingill start fooling around with mods  And there are lots

twoIf you are looking for a game that requires you to manage your timeresourcespowerand even amunitionlook no further I have looked for a game like this for years A game that is survivalbut you can thrive instead of just surviving by making robots and machines do everything for you I have already recomended this game to 5 or 6 of my friends If you have the moneyand like using your brain to overcome problems and build thingsBUY THIS GAMEand much less laggy then anticipatedeven with over 3 robots all doing different things on the screenI have found many bugs I have not found a single bug

airlocklike alloys or more compressed liquidsand the steam workshop just makes them accessed easierI love this game I have never even heard of these devs until nowand they are some of the best devs I have seen If you like builderstower defence gamessurvival gamesor anything like those genresbuy this game I already know you will love itI really like the fact that you have no time whatsoever left to spend on trivial things like my wifethe kidsfood or workAfter 8445 hoursyeah I think I would recommend this game to a friend  Its like crack spaghetti crackSo you can probably tell by the review score that the game is more than capable of meeting players expectationsbut what do people come here for in the first placepeople with engineering degreesthe entire population of Germanyor at least people who are into that technical stuffbut thats only partially true Factorio issimply puta fun videogame about building things with an industrial space theme If you liked tycoon games like RollerCoaster TycoonTransport TycoonRailroad TycoonZoo Tycoonor citybuilding ones like SimCityCities Skylines or Caesar 3you probably already know the basic gist You build a sprawling factory to gradually achieve a singlebig taskand its really fun to watch it in motion The big twist on the formula that Factorio brings is that it borrows crafting elements now common in modern mainstream games to make the building less a matter of using money to make moneyand more about crafting basic resources into usable items It just so happens that these items are buildings that you build your factory out of In essenceyoure building a factorybuilding factoryhence the common mantra the factory must growthough At the top of the crafting pyramid are the socalled science packsa complex item that exists solely to be consumed to progress the games tech tree Said tech tree starts you off with simple tools to familiarize yourself with the basics of mining and smeltingand eventually branches out towards truer and truer automationculminating in a factory that literally builds itself using thousands of flying construction drones The mere prospect of that can make a new players head spinbut in reality the game actually gets easier once everything gets automatedsince you can just sit back and watch things happen The ultimate goal is naturally to climb to the very top of the tech treehowever you dont have to worry about aimlessly building up to that point since there are plenty of interesting intermediate steps worthy of investigation The game sustains a steady dripfeed of new technologies that often change up the formula completelysuch as new forms of power productionitem transportation or even access to completely unique production chains like liquid oil and radioactive uraniumso youre very unlikely to go bored during the 46 hour playthroughit can seem as though the game is very complex and hardbut as I said beforethe bigger your factory getsthe more you can afford to chill For this reason the game rarely gets described as hardbut its not exactly a cakewalk either You do get an infinite amount of space to build your factory however you wantbut at the end of the day the resources wont craft themselvesand a bare minimum of planning is required to lay things out at least a bit logically You can build your mines on the opposite end of the factory to the smelters and connect them with a single line of beltbut you cant expect to smelt a lot of items that way been theredone that Not that its necessarily a bad way of doing thingsbut lets just say theres better ways as well This extends to practically all facets of Factoriomaking it a game thats easy to play and beatbut practically impossible to masterI love it lotsstill returning to it now and then for a playthrough whenever I dont have better things to do that week Its well and truly one of the best games to come out of the past decade and I wish more people built up the courage to give it a shot Did you notice there is a free demo If youre still on the fencegive it a go Youre welcomeFactorio is a game that sneaks up on you You start out so simpleharvesting some coal and ironchopping down a tree or two Then you plonk down a machine that starts mining iron ore for youand you feed the result into a furnace You build more machinesthen some inserters More machinesand it becomes easier to link up a few things with conveyor beltsso organicallythat at no point you felt overwhelmedbut you cant stop now  you just build a tank and you really want to try it out on that alien base that has been growing way too muchthis game has actually changed my lifehow can anyone manage to focus on all that at oncewatching others and taking it one step at a timebecause you can beat it
1,Finally I can sack Ole Gunnar Solskjæri spent £20 million as Newcastle and im still only 8th in the league 00 for realismspurs are terrible very realisticFirst of all i would like to thank my great friend Samuel Seal for gifting me this great gamei would like to warn anyone that has a wife and kids that they will end up hating you as your love for Juve Stabia or other lowly obscure teams grows into an obsession fuelled by Just Eat and Deliveroothe data hub is a good addition and the match engine is smoothalthough there are some things that need addressing at some pointlike the ridiculous headers for instanceon floppy disc hahaha who remembers Champ Manager italia and they never get old for mein my first 55 hours playedI didnt play a single matchWas really tossing up buying the game as didnt have any particular saves planned Have 000 hours on FM2 and similar numbers for FM820 and thought that the game didnt look different enough from the previews I was shocked when I played the game and noticed so many new featuresUI updates The data analysis update makes the analytics easier to understand and provides more precise information on how you your playersteam follows your tacticsits even really fun just going through in depth and finding hidden details In terms of gameplayI dont have a great understanding of the enginebut my first reactions are it looks more and more like your team is actually playing football and its not just the same 8 or so different highlight packages that FM can often feel like The Centre Backs is where Ive noticed the greatest differencenot just with the new Wide Centre Back role which is a lot of fun to mess around with but even with Ball Playing Defenders actually making runs forward like youd see in a real game and not just mulling round on the ball before launching a long ball into space Finally if you like doing the small stuff like attending press conferences and team talksthe dialogue feels a lot more randomizedunique this year so far Overallif you love FM22 provides so much more than just a roster updateand youre bound to notice the subtle changes in details that make all the differenceI buy FM every two years Its better than FM 20Ive enjoyed playing the game for the last 2 weeksnot a lot has changed from last years release but i wasnt expecting much changei just enjoy the updated teams and player improvementscompany greed makes me sick in my opinion this isnt aimed at new comers as i truly believe they wont even know about the in game editor at firstnooo this is aimed at us lotthe loyal fan base who return year after year 50p increasefine but an almost 50 increase is filth This isnt about the price as the IGE is still quite cheapbut nothing new has been added to itnothing has changed from the last decadeso why that much of a price jump  imagine next years releaseand the full game costs £72would we be happy with thatPlay As Liverpoolnewcastle 200mIf I was to compare this game to FM2comparing your players with the rest of the leagueand analysing the oppositionas the quality of youth players will change depending on the nations standingallowing you to assign scouts to more specific areas of a continentand look like they were done using the airbrush in MS Paintlike to do buildanation savesor just want the database updateI would absolutely recommend picking up FM22 If you only use plugandplay tacticsare a casual playerandor are tight for cashthen maybe stick with FM2 as it is still a good gameBeen playing now for 56 hours and love it apart from one thing too many press conferences Seems like every other minute Im told Im due to go into a press meeting soapart from thatIm enjoying the game Have to confess as a 60 year old womanI do cheat have much fun creating a teambuying loads of top players and winning every match so satisfying Anywaycant cope with the action games and find the pace of this right up my street Have been playing since the original Championship Manager games back in the 90s so would call myself a fairly seasoned playerNo need to write long sentences here I got it like Im paying my annual taxI cant remember how my girlfriend looks like since this game was launchedIve never bought and sold so many children from South America beforeJust be better than Ole Been playing FM for about 5 years and as always it is a great game and ill always get several hundred hours out of the game as a minimumbut please for love of god like I have said every year for the last 5 update the UI  UXand the graphical parts of the game are more fitting of 20not 202 The regen  manager faces are still awful despite Miles wearing them as some sort of badge of honor  they look terrible and the backgrounds on the stadiums just ruin any visual aspect of the game Neither of those would take huge amounts of resources to improve but make a massive difference There is a huge modding community that SI continues to make life difficult for that do a much better job than SI and they all do it for free anywaythey are 5 years out of date  there are several things you have to go through many menus to get too when  click would do a job It would not hurt them to strip it back and make the menus simplerand group the information inside that For several years now they have just added new features ontop of the current menus and it makes them cluttered and unorganised I would be happy if FM23 consisted of absolutely no improvementsjust a major UI  UX redesignit would make such a differenceanybody that has tried to create their own squadtransfer view will know what I am talking about It is like its only mini game inside the game just trying to rearrange the viewsbut it is starting to feel like a game where they have added 0 years of updates on top of a gameinstead of making a new game The game is cluttered and you have too much information that you just dont need A proper UIUX redesign next year please SISpent £20m on Haalandgot injured for 7 months on his debut00this game makes fifa look terribleThis damn Feetball  Menageru gameuvomitingdiarrheaingschreeching and yeeting crap all over the houseafter I beat them

doneAnd rememberthe most powerful card is your Credit CardNow you can send 5 year olds to the Shadow Realm on PCIve played over 4 duels on the mobile version as Im writing thisand Im sure I have at least a few hundred hours invested into this game I enjoy playing this game a lotand Ill explain why this game is worth my time herethe newerflashiermodern TCG is too fast and lacks strategic depth Synchro summoning may be passable for somebut XYZPendulumand now Link summoning is weird We miss Tribute and Ritual summoningand we enjoy the slower format of the gameand thats why Duel Links is so appealing to people like me It brings the game closer to what we originally enjoyed from the TCG Suresome adjustments were made like smaller decks and a smaller playfieldbut the essense of the original game is still captured hereits natural to be concerned about this game being P2W I wont lieyou can get a pretty big advantage by paying real money Let me make a case for playing without spending money though If you compare Duel Links against HearthstoneDuel Links shine in many areas As a F2P Hearthstone playeryou log in each daygrind out your quests and imaybei grind out some additional currency by winning games If youre a new playeryoure likely up against veteran players who have accumulated a large pool of cards making it hard to play against themwhich makes your own accumulation of cards rather unenjoyablePvE is a massive part of the game iYesiits grindybut not in the same unenjoyable manner as Hearthstone PvE scales as you progress in the game and eases you into more complex gameplay and strategies It allows players to enjoy playing the game without making PvP the only way to grind out cardsKonami is extremely generous with handing out currency to buy card packs in the game Theres usually a new event every weekand if you put in some timeyou can get quite a bit of currency with a relatively low investment of time Since playing the game when it first came out a year agoIve only spent around 15 on the gameand I have a few fun decks that I use competitively I also have a lot of fun making creative decks and messing around in casualunranked games tooyoull find that ranked play is very rewarding The game has new seasons every monthand each season resets your rewards list One thing that Duel Links does great is rewarding you for playing competitively Ill pick on Hearthstone again In Hearthstoneyou log indo your daily questsand thats pretty much it You dont really have more incentive in playing any more games for the day In Duel Linksthere are no daily caps in what you can earn from ranked play Theoreticallyif you spend your entire day playing ranked and winningyou can amass a lot of rewardswhile still being able to play more to earn more That is something I appreciate Some daysI just feel like playing a ranked game or two to take a break from PvEand some days I go full HAM and spend hours playing ranked I feel well rewarded in both casesit really is just a port of the mobile version Howeverthere are some real benefits and convenience in playing it on PC These includewhich facilitates building decksyoull appreciate the fact that Konami managed to get all the old voice actors and actresses to voice their old roles Konamis keeping an eye on the power creep in the game Im sure it will grow in the futurebut with the amount of effort that Konami is demonstrating now in curating which cards are added to the gameI have confidence that Konami can keep this game from spiralling into the nonsense that plagues the modern TCGpeople from MTG and Hearthstone to try something newpeople who just want a nostalgia trip back to their childhoodand people who have never heard of YuGiOh too It really is a fun time building and playing decksand

1,Oh man Where to even begin with this one It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma  a shooteras it is soso much more than that Arma  is a military simulator This is a distinction that it’s developers hold sacred and are proud ofand one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved But it’s even more than that Arma  is a gaming platformupon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to comeArma  in a supremely excellent military sim The graphics are stunningthe gameplay is excellentthe mechanics are solidand Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together New comers to the Arma series as I was may initially be overwhelmed by the game’s complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPSshooter Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often briefbrutaland more times than not will conclude with your demise There is no handholding here No minimapsno enemy UI iconsindicatorsno hit markersno health bars If you get shot a couple of timesyou will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new playersit provides a unique and distinctive play style Situational awarenesscoverteamworksuppressive fireand generally moving purposefully and as if your ass depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehiclesarmorhelicoptersand planeseach with their own realistic mechanics to learn and masterand you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experienceArma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of  separate actseach containing 1215 missions The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma ’s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement The campaign is rewardingand challenging I have yet to complete it as I’m stuck on one mission that I simply can’t seem to completeall of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselvesoh god the multiplayer

haven’t even discovered yet Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma  platform By purchasing Arma you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate gameArma  is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to comeand they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endlessplease leave a comment as to why I welcome the constructive feedbackh1Immersive  trying  Recommended for those that cherish depth  complexityh1save for a few issues here and there ie empty buildingshas largely aged well  looks fantasticcontentpacked single player campaign player choices do affect potential endingsas there are severalwhich helps SIGNIFICANTLY to combat the monotony of walkingrunning very long distances between objectivesto underwater missions everything inbetweena little practice goes a long way  serves to open up a slew of options on the battlefield vehicle sound effects tend to sound strangely mutedsome of the dialogue is a bit awfulbut for the pruposes of a video gameit can put players to sleep in some missions the tutorial felt inadequate overall mechanics are amazing on paperbut take an inordinate amount of time to masterThis is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gamingthis is a game for people who appreciate the finer things Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality There are experiences you will have in ARMA  that can not be had in COD or BFexperiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline releaseI was squad leader of 8 or so AIsno firing unless fired upon We moved slowly taking advantage of terrainkeeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 0 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the towerand these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killedI realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the towerall the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measureif one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention I turned around and made my way backas I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall backhope growing that I might get out of this alivefrom there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command I had done it I had pulled off the perfect missionnot a shot fired and all under my command back aliveHaving accumulated over 1400 hours ingame with iArma iI would certainly recommend it to othersits well worth a look especially if you appreciate a high dose of military realismthis game ruined my life1010Its starts with you buying it on a sale because you want another shooterfind out that its not that kind of a shooter and stop playing it for  months minimum Decide to give it another shot but play by its rules and you find that you actually enjoy its complexity Then somebody comes over and saysyou wanna try this but Vietnam and also be in a unit with other dipshits that enjoy this game and you say yes because Vietnam sounds awesome Spoiler Its not and you want to play with a more organized groupyou have spent 4 years playing with the same group of peoplewhile having 20 FPS on lowest settings and the game is keeping 1 of your week days hostage as you have scheduled events every week You also subscribe to the Steam forums and check reddit to find more victims to sacrifice to BI so as to have their next patch not fuck up all the 58 mods you are using 1 hour before your operationssimulation or the answer to the question How can I commit a war crimes but not be punished for it Its the friends we made a long the way to commit those war crimesevery flipped convoy that ruins the operation 15 minutes from startingits the AI shooting your though 0 layers of foliageits the enemy artillery firing once but the shell exploding 6  times over a km radiusevery new guy throwing a grenade under your feet while you play dress up in the arsenallaughing your ass off as your Zeus tries to spice things up with roll playingcrying as Zeus retaliates for killing his roll play doll for lolsevery insane AT shot made by one of your guysevery terribly fired RPG you didits every time the AI some how flanked you and every time you fight your way though itArma  summarytoo OPtoo OPtoo OPask zeusgot intellife goodteam angrystop simpingthen a casual like you shouldnt be herethey are pretty cool playersi wont fight it cause im a cowardI spent several years in the army and I gotta say this game is spot on with the training and atmosphere the military provides I love how difficult this game isand I love all of the different features the game provides It is NOT easy to hit a target with an assault rifle from 00 yards in real lifeand this game seems to match that same difficulty Fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real lifeArma  makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gearor you will have a hard time hitting your target Enemies are not stupid and they have great vision I was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 5 second rushes when moving The AI is more advanced than the average taliban are in real life haha p Given my love for the military and for videogamesthis one is definitely one of my favorites of all time DWhere do I start with Arma have I played enough of this game Nonot in the slightest My total playtime see above is pathetic in comparison to those around me I see upwards of 20000004000 hours just looking at the reviews currently At the time of writing this reviewI sit on a measly 61 hours of gameplayso I am in no way an expert of this gamerapid paced combat Battlefield slows it down a bitbut maintains a good balance of action and spacing between engagementswhich adds massive suspense and makes every firefight veryvery meaningful When combat initiatesthere is definately adrenaline pumping actionbut its not fast Combat is very slowalmost methodical just like real life but veryvery awesome Some things that youll see in an Arma firefight that you will not see anywhere elseoften hundreds of meters awayespecially if youre roaming the hills or open wilderness Enemies may only be a fleck in your scopeon another hill entirelyseveral football fields away from youyoull be forced to take cover and locate the enemy the old fashioned way watching and listeningyou probably wont have time to react One or two shots will kill you without much warningAntiTankHeavy Gunners all have a part to play in their teams successsquadees must be willing to take orders and communicate with their superioirs Directions will not be called out like LEFT RIGHT but rather with compass bearings such as Theres at least  of them at 248stand up super tallsit downlean on your sidebend your body left and right etc Manipulating these stances and using them to show as little of you as possible may be a key factor on whether you live or diebut you might also give your position away or get shot as you peak out of cover Forget to look left Arma teaches that wherever you dont lookthere will be something that kills youyour squad may advance only for one of them to be shot by a very much alive enemy solidereverybody continues their daily routines and hopefully somebody with anti tank weaponry deals with the 15 ton chunk of metal Armored vehicles are terrifyingly powerful with weapons foot soldiers can only dream of A whole squad of 20 people will immediately hit the deck if one of them shpws uphoping that their AT guys can do the job becauseor HALO jumpwhich teleports you to an exaxct location but 6000 feet up in the skyforcing you to have to use your parachute to land safely HALO jumping back into combat is suicide Big shiny glorified baloons make reallyreally good target practice That also meansyoure hooped unless someone takes the risk and picks the launcher off his dead body That isunless the tankarmored car blows him up before he gets there Then 20 people are stranded with very little to dowhich meansentirely It took us upwards of an hourbut  we checked every single buildingroom by roomuntilIn the center plazathere he stood the last man we had to kill All the other building were checkedand I saw a head poking out behind this obstacle in the dead center of the cityCentral Gardenstraight north I notice he pokes his head around the corner My assault rifle was depletedmissfiremissrinse andrepeat I empty my whole clip and the man is not dead So I reloadand just start Terminator walking my way towards this guy Firing every round I have The guy doesnt poke his head out anymore One clip exhaustedthen another And another This guy will not die I least Im supressing himshoots me once Deadtalking about how wicked that mission was We get a new onesomething about planting a bomb somewhereat least We just kept talkinggetting closer to the LZmocking the pilot for driving too low to the ground We land and immediatelythe chopper comes under fireMy first game on A brought me the most horrific experience Ive ever had in any gameevera small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces Im leading a team of 4 men We come to a crossroad and I sprint acrosstelling my men to hold back I cross a few more timestrying to get a response from any snipers Nothingmy Autorifleman runsmy Medic runs But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure wed make it acrosshe played it up to 11 heredrenched in his own bloodRIGHT II WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS CMON SARGEHHELP ME CMON PLEASE DONT LEAVE MEwould recommend gettingI had a lot of fun But its time to step away from old faithful and move on until the big number 4 comes outhad lots of funraged often and broke a great many monitors and miscellaneous peripherals 810Im not into arma anymorebut as you can probably tell from the amount of hours Ive spent paying this game Ive had an incredible timeand neither too silly It was very balancedvery fun Very replayableso lets talk about other thingsobviously  as the game is all about fighting loland other things such as weapons becoming less effective as the bullet travels midairyou also have very aweosmelooking postures which you can adopt from laying proneto sitting on your bumto crouchingleaning sidetosideand all dat weird jazzyou can only take 15 shots before you die pending on which weapon is used against you and what kind of protective gear you have equipped This means that you have to be VERY careful ingameotherwise you might just get shot in the head and die PersonallyI enjoy such hardcore mechanicsyoure likely to take a hell of a lot of damageand this is where armour becomes a huge importance without armouryou are as vulnerable as a mouse surrounded by a horde of cats I shouldnt even need to stress how much you need armour You can go lightor heavy  your choice The amount you wear does affect movement speed thoughso do be careful of that It also affects how badass you look I generally like to go light so I look like a badass mofo who is totally capable of destroying anyone who crosses my path lol Not only thatbut your appearance can also affect how easily an enemy can spot you So if you have a huge bag on your backand lightly coloured clothes you can be sure people will spot you with easeI know But I am most certainly not done We have to talk about the tanksand the awesome vehicles that can totally blow ur balls offthere are about 20 different ground vehiclesall unique in both appearance and purpose You have a few antivehicle tanksa few antipeople tanksand a few artillery and antiair tanks PersonallyI love the artillerytheyre like mini nukes lollongstoryshort  arma has tons of vehiclesall awesome in both appearance and nature Very useful for committing massgenocide on dem pesky capitalist NATO forcesmmmmsatisfactoryso youre not restricted to just playing one gamemode and getting bored after an hour I believe Ive already listed one already roleplay Others include but are not limited todue to custom game modes etc TDMKOHKTFPLAYER VS AIforgot the official classificationsorry5v5 COMPETITIVE MATCHES like that csgo competitive game modecustom zombie modesand survival modes There are also singleplayer game modes which you can hostsuch as Zeus or custom Addons which allow for various different gameplay experiences which brings me to my next topicto Star Warsto enhanced combat system and mechanic modsxcom modsand various others which add more vehiclesfactionsarmourclothingmore aietcso you can rest assured that youll be able to configure almost anything you wantso lag shouldnt really be a problem especially if you tune down the graphics via the settings menus a bitas Ive briefly mentioned previouslywith the game modes This game is almost solely multiplayerbasedbut singleplayer is a thing and can be funso dont feel restricted This game being focused mainly on multiplayer is obviously good for playing with friends You can have much fun playing with friends online in this gamemuch fun indeed Lag can be a problem thoughso make sure you have a decent internet connection and dont be disappointed if you cant play with a friend based half way across the world from you  but personally I feel the devs have really improved connectibility over the passed years in terms of multiplayer Id say its currently at its peakso I advise suchIm starting to like it I think Will definitely play it a little moreFirst time playing ARMAim new to the game in chatA rapid cacophony of impacts broke the monotony of drivingaccompanied by the chatter and crack of automatic fire hitting the vehicle The person next to me that I had been talking to was deadslumped over and covered in blood by the time I realised we were in the middle of an ambushas its wheels had been taken out by a 40MM grenadeandbecause I had been shot in the legcrawled my way into a ditch at the side of the roadwhere I passed out and diedafter all this timeI can finally review this gamewhich is rather extreme You will initially be very confused by things and somethe AI and the ballistics in particularare very complex and not well explained ingamethe game opens up and its absurd freedom starts tp show you can do ANYTHING in this gamedespite it being presented as a military tactical gamepeople working jobsdriving around and having a police force and jobsto the Survival and postapocalypse gamemodes revolving around the pursuit of food and waterweapons and transport to stay alivewhich bring a Battlefield style gameplay mode into Armaand you have the original BATTLEGROUNDSwhich was so popular it is now available as a standalone gamemaking the already impressive realism to ever greater levelswith things like new weaponsuniforms and vehicles covering every nation in the worldto advanced medical modes that take into account blood losssurgeons and battlefield trauma  medical care to fantastic and impressive detailsand range from small groups to friends to massive clans with over 00 active members Arma can support over 160 players in a single multiplayer gamein addition to hundreds of AI soldiersso the scale of some of these groups in without comparison to anything else except EVEfrom how the ballistics and each individual round is modelled in the gameand affected by velocitydropzeroingpenetration against various materials from woodbricksteel and body armourto rounds being able to bounce and deflect due to highangle ricochets on hard surfaces like concrete or vehiclesand the game covers everything from underwater combat and submarinesland battles with infantry and tanks with modular damage to systems and partsmaking it possible tofor exampleknock out a tanks tracks and turret without destroying itleaving it totally helplessall the way to nextgeneration jet fighters and advanced radar detectionthermal and IR technologyto commanding a tank crew in a pitched battle in the Iraqi desert during the Gulf Warto evacuating wounded soldiers from thick Vietnamese jungles in 1970before using an American aircraft carrier to stage for a dogfight above Russia in the modern dayall in the course of a few hourswho add a massive range of things to the gamefrom new vehiclessoundsmapscampaigns and new missionssystems and anything you can possibly think of Someone has either made it or is working on it from ALIEN and Star Warsrole playing free roam and Police carsto every weapon and piece of equipment used by the BritishAmericanFrenchGerman and Russian armies over the past decadesand never even touched the multiplayer aspects until after thatand Steam Workshop support for mods and missions is fantasticand revolves around NATO forces on the islands of Altis and Stratis based on real islands off the coast of Greece and their fighting with the native AAF armed forces and the more advanced CSATbased on an Iran ME allianceand you are thrown into a situation where you are NOT the winnersbeing constantly on the backfoot and fighting with lesser equipment and as guerrillas and insurgents fighting against a military with superior armaments to youwhich is a nice change from the normal state of affairs in gameswhere you play the exact oppositeyour style of play and if you do the optional freeroaming missionpinflank and use a decent level of tacticsso its often best to take some time to plan your mission in advance What cover is in the area What is the sightlines and visibility and is a stealth approach possible Where are the enemy patrol routes and is there any chance of enemy reinforcements What type of enemy soldiers and equipment do you suspect they have night visionmachinegunsmarksmensupport assets like vehicles or static weapons can affect your approach to your objectivewhich has some great presentation and polishbased on Tanoawhich is a fictional island off the coast of Fijiand is a utterly STUNNING looking mapwell worth the price of the Expansionoff the coast of Fiji and Australiaand follows a smallwell equipped British special forces groupCTRGand their fighting against the Syndikate drug Cartel in the jungles As special forces you are often deployed at nightand have access to advanced equipment like thermals and night visionputting you at a technological advantage over the Cartelbut the Cartel have greater numbers so a standup battle is often a fatal problem its often possible to avoid patrols and soldiers Apex also adds a wide range of weapons including the AK47MAK12AKS74UHK416 and HK417M249 SAWMP5K PDWparticularly in Multiplayerthe performance of the server and the mission is paramount MOST of the highly popular and heavily scripted gamemodes will not get 60 FPSregardless of settingsbut with a good server and mission you can achieve 60 FPS The game is biased towards CPU clock speedrather than the GPU like most other gamesso a higher clock CPU sees much better performance than a GPU upgradeand the DLCs always come with free platform updatesadding new features like bipodssound overhaulsnew weapon and clothing features like thermal concealmentadvanced helicopter flight models for more simulatorlike flyingand many others it would take too long to listput simplythe most widely varied and impressive game I have ever playedand the absurd number of hours I have in the game  is a testament to its great communityauthentic gameplay and varied experiences bazillion reviews No one will read thisBreakdown of my 000 hours played since betareleaseand people gave this game a really bad name for the first year it was out I say to heckwith them allbuggy betas make for fun times with good peoplegrossly overplayed and exaggerated Howeverit was still good and there were plenty of mods on Armaholic we could download to try out Ended up being a learning experience for everyoneand workshop is starting to show its head This was the time that I spent having the most fun in this game Learned how to play during this time period and began working on content creation  and mission makingdeveloping my own mislim group I have spent the majority of this time missionmaking and hosting servers This is the peak of what I would say is my overall experience playing this game After learning everything I can and passing it on to new playersI feel exhausted but very satisfiedand I would recommend it to anybody You dont have to milsimand you dont have to play it like a military game The mod community and public server community have brought plenty of roleplayrpgtdmcoopand koth that anyone can jump into right away Aside from thisthere are even more private communities with the most amazing and unique experiences that you could have while playing this game If you are looking for a game that will challenge your leadership and charismathis is the game for you If you are looking for a laidback experience to socialize in a virtual world with your friendsthis is the game for you If you want to feel like you are down in the dirt fighting alongside people you just met whom you now consider your closest friends under stressthis is the game for you Arma  has brought MilSim gaming to another level of coolI have owned this game for a number of weeks now and I have been completely hooked Great game for the more serious war gamernot for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anywaysimilar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 1020 minutes in a single location sometimes longerI personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forwardthe game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used toand if you do buy the game  I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in gameAfter some 1400 hours on the gameI can say with FULL VALIDITY this game has ruined my lifeteamworkand every form of warfarethis game is for youRight before i get started  I was a massive fan of the Arma series and have been for 10 yearsit is the reason i bought my first gaming PCit remembered all my modsdownloaded them then i fired the game upbefore you know it times up and you cant be bothered It was like that I sat in the in game menu for one minute screen shot to prove it before deciding not to play I exited the gamesteam and shut down my PCbattleye do Please contact battleye if you need support with a bansteams explanation of a DEV BAN which states a developer informs valve of an account that is suspicious and valve ban them I have sent images of my conversation with BE and proof that in the two weeks before my ban i had one minute of game time which was spent in the menuOH   but it looks like this is the end of the road for me I will miss the random chats in gamethe communities i was part of and the battles of the fieldif you guys blow this up they might just let me back 
1,An example to all those stuck in Early AccessIm impressed by the developers work ethics hereIn my opinionthis is the best roguelite deckbuilder ever made and also in contention for the best roguelite ever The design of the game is close to perfect  every cardrelicand enemy is in for a reason and serves a purposeand theres almost no additions to the game that serve to just up the item count without offering interesting playstyle consequences Its very easy to understandand yet that betrays its considerable depth and endless replayability Its very goodMy boi NL convinced me this game was the best roguelike crossed deckbuilder game hed ever played  He was rightI love card games of all types I grew up playing traditional card games like Crazy EightsSolitaire and Uno I later got into BridgeRummy and Poker until Magic the Gathering MtG consumed my life for yearsThunderstoneRace for the Galaxy and many more I had a ton of fun playing thesebut again it is hard to get a group together on a consistent basis so I turned to the PC Several of these games have pretty good PC versionsbut they are still restricted by the fact that they are based on physical games There are often clunky mechanics that really slow things down Thats fine when playing with friends at homebut over the Internet or alone against an AI it tends to get old pretty fastbut most of them are based on card collecting and those can rival even Magic the Gathering in cost if you want to stay up to date with the best cardsA game it took me weeks of hearing people talk about before I finally gave it a chance This little weird looking card game has somehow managed to tap into so many things I love about card games and video games that when people ask me about it I struggle to even say anything about it because there is so much I want to sayyou pick them up and see if you have a good hand That rush of excitement at the possibilities of what your hand has for you never gets oldits why I got so heavily into Magic the Gatheringsince apposed to games like Bridge or Rummy you get to draw new cards constantly This is also true for deck builders and even more so with Slay the Spire than many others since you play your hand fast and dont have to worry about building your deck while youre playing it This brings me to my second pointso you know what your deck is missing before you pick your new card I really love building my deck as I play with itits how I used to tinker with my MtG decks back in the day and the reason why the physical deck building games appealed so much to me Slay the Spire has the incremental building of a deck builderbut without the constant stop and think style of play which slow those games down This makes the pacing of the game much more interesting You have an action phasefollowed by a thinking phase Rather than jumbling them both into each othermore so than any other deck builder Ive played While games like Dominion and Thunderstone have a lot of different card combinations for you to play I simply find myself enjoying what I can do in Slay the Spire more It also plays very fastit flows a bit like Heartstone in that senseunless you have very complicated deck combinations which requires some forethought or specific play orderswhich usually is either attackblock or apply some buffdebuff This means what you do on your turn is informed by that If the monster attacksyou blockif it blocks or buffs itself you attack Having this kind of AI interaction in a physical game could be possiblebut would require a lot of dice rolling or boring set up between rounds As you play the game more you start to learn how the different monsters work and develop strategies for each of themmaking each game a little easier than the previous Its not just your deck thats getting betterits your ability to play it as wellwhich is one of the reasons why MtG can take forever to playbut with the game being digital all this is taken care of in the background The digital version of Magic the Gathering handles these things for you as wellbut since its rooted in a physical game it is a lot slower and more cumbersome than Slay the SpireCivilization being my favorite game of the genre That genre has the ability to captivate me in a way that makes me just play on and onone more turn at a timeeven though I know I should have stopped hours ago Slay the Spire does the same thing for me Each game of Slay the Spire consists of 3 floors with multiple encounters with a boss at the end of each floorif you die or win you get some experience points towards new unlocks and you can start again on a new run It plays similarly to a Rogue Like in that waya genre that Ive always been fascinated bybut never got very deep intobut Slay the Spire got its hooks into me very hard It took me quite the force of will to say No to another game so I could take the time to write this review I cant wait until its over so I can try out the latest patch Which reminds meRim WorldSubnauticaPrison ArchitectOxygen Not Included and others that actually listen to their communityprovide regular updates and already have a game that is worth playing as it is Slay the Spire in my opinion joins the rank of these great games without question The technical aspects of the game is top notchit plays smoothlytheres a ton of content and it has received multiple significant updates over the few weeks Ive played it With a clearly defined Roadmap that promise more content in a game I feel already has enough content to justify its price 5 times over I have no doubt that the game will be finished and even if development stopped today I would be more than satisfied with my purchaserestricted cardsspecial relics or modifiersnew cardsmore monstersnew charactersetc I feel like this game has managed to do one of those things that you dont really see all that often It has taken the best from many different genrescombined it in a new way and created something greater than the sum of its partsA while back I tried Darkest Dungeonand I was constantly googling items and strategiestrying to figure out what does whatand I was always stressed that I was going to do the wrong thingI have hardly googled anything to find out what it doesit just immediately makes sense And rather than being scared to try things outI cant wait to see what every card does The game makes you feel like youre actually good at iteven if youre not that good at itI never found it in my ten hours to be really unfair Sometimes you get a garbage handbut maybe your next hand will work And I even died multiple times without wishing pain on the creators of the gameand that is the best compliment I can giveI dont have a lot of time for gaming anymore and with around 1 games in my library Ive never even playedIm trying to cut back on buying new ones So when a friend told me I bhadb to play this oneI was skeptical I do love card games and strategy  but I also have a lot of burnout from poor Early Access experiences and since my maternity leave is over and now I have to ughmake money AND look after a babyabsolutely no spare time for gaming So I surprised myself when I realized that three days after launching thisId managed to clock up 15 hoursthe unfinished laundry and my mums messages asking if Im okay because she hasnt heard from me for a few days may be related in some waybut you cant prove anything I was so tired last night I beat the final boss with the Ironclad for the first timesent a screenshot to the friend who bullied me into playing the game essential stepturned my PC offwalked to bed and fell asleepto dream of deck buildinghis playstyle choices have been vastly different He prefers Silentthe poison characterwhereas I prefer Ironcladthe strength deck Hed never used the style of deck I used to get my first win barricademassive armor stackingdual wield into body slam and I played with quite a few different deck types before settling on my winning synergy Even though there are not a massive array of cardsthere is a significant amount of choice and strategy in your playcoupled with constant adjustments needing to be made as you pick up relics and rewards reviews no I mean literallythats not a meme and overwhelmingly positiveyou dont need someone slow to this bandwagon to describe the mechanics of the game What I will say is this is a fun roguelike deckbuilding card game that is simple to grasphard to master and incredibly addictive Id love to say it can be played in short bursts when you have 3 minutes here and therebut only if youve levelled your willpower to max and can walk away from the PCeven in Early Accesswith hopefully even more content to comeplease follow  urlhttpstoresteampoweredcomcurator28971565My Curator Pageurl 💖pretty good game except for the jaw wurm i cannot for the life of me understand how the devs put out patch after patch without nerfing this ridiculous enemy you might as well put the final boss of the game on the first floor runs are won and lost based entirely on enemy rng butr otehr thanf thatquite goodlove the graphicsNo one will ever read this but I recommend this gameIts a good game with high replayability I play it to escape the big sadJust wish it was also mobile so I could play at work and probably get firedplease make mobile versionRemember when you where young and you could play a single player game for hoursdaysweeks without getting bored With growing age it seemed no single player game could give me this feeling anymore Until I got Slay the Spire This game is a masterpiece I got hooked instantly and could not let go anymore It is worth every penny Buy itIve bought the game three times on various platformsMy account says 19 hours played I have over 5 hours on this game on iOScool moves you can dolevels that you need to go throughyou knowvideo gamey stuff It even has potions StillI decided to look at it as something a bit more than just a video gameand I was likeyeah this is stupid difficultdo people actually win against thisand yeah people win against it Not only thatbut they win against it with handicaps It starts off with one handicap Then you get another And another Its like you already have the odds against youbut you stack them against you even more And moreup to 2 different disadvantages to start off with Yet people still win consistently at the game How is thatI started to understand In this gameyoure given a deck of cards You cant control what cards you will findnor what elites or bosses you will encounter Never the lessthrough your own decision makingyou can turn squalid conditions to your advantage and come out on top despite the oddsI decided to view this as more than just a game Its a simulation that demonstrates the power of making decisions that have thought behind them Decisions that weigh pros and consthat consider consequences I learned that a bad situationeven if it is bad and will certainly end baddoes not have to be ias bad as it getsi By carefully considering optionsstudying the situationone can mitigate whatever negative aspects exist in any given situation If they are also luckyor particularly giftedthey may even reverse it into a good situationand as a good demonstration of how powerful this concept is I was able to go from a situation I really was convinced was hopelessto being able to regularly and casually beat that same boss that I thought was impossible a year backwith at least 112 different handicaps on top of that All because I changed how I think and how I made decisionsyou still have an exceptional game to playThe hours on record speak for themselvesh1 TLDR Sumup h1and build their character and deck with random drops Slay the Spire has players strugglingscreamingragingthen asking for

will evolve is down to luck and very strategic choicesthen struggled for the next 8 hours That saidcard games are random by natureand this formula is meant to appeal to players who enjoy facing strong and uncertain odds To somewhat balance this builtin unfairnessthoughthe developers have implemented a forced flush mechanicwhere unplayed cards automatically go to a flush pile after ending a turn This system helps knowing what card will come next and allows nice little tricks such as digging in the flush pile for that one card that might very well change the issue of the battlesome other aspects could benefit from a lot more polish The art is sometimes painful to watch bonfire screens in particular need a lot more work and I personally found the music and sound effect lacking impact Too standard and repetitive to be immersiveno dynamic soundtrackvery few sound effects for the variety of cards providedand generally forgettable themes I do play on mute That saidthe game still being in early accessthere is still hope for improvement and in any casethe art doesn’t matter that much once a combat has startedthe only real downside of the game is its animations With no variety whatsoeverthey are also slow enough even on their fastest setting to account for a good 3 of a turn’s time depending on how fast players take their decisions With nothing to justify this length and no skip optionthey increase the duration of single runs and decrease the funtime ratio Added to the general boredom of the first 2 or 3 fightsand a title that could be much more nervous currently suffers for an unequal pace that can become uncomfortablewhich palliate for its lack of artistic polish and uneven pacing Its freshappealing formula is meant for challenge seekersto which I recommend it even at its current price Newcomers to either card battle games or rogelikelites might want to wait for a discountI fell asleep in the middle of trying to finish just one more run and woke up with the controller still in my hand the next day This hasnt happened to me since I was a little kid so I felt the game deserved an early reviewMultiple characters with their own cards and playstylesa real solid difficulty curve that rewards strategy and punishes carelessness Though it is in early access and more content is always appreciatedthe core gameplay loop is complete and very entertaining A quick browse shows the developers update the game on a weekly basis and seem fairly responsive to community concerns and ideas Definitely recommend investing into the game before it leaves early access and its price increasesif you are like me you will need to fiddle with your Pro controller in the game setting and get used to wrong Xbox positioned icons being displayed for your face buttons The developers seem aware of the issues and hassles and are looking into itIts like cocaineEverytime you think that youre going to make this awesome buildyou die and then suddenly its already 4 amNothings perfectgather cards as you climb up and fight battlesgo through eventsrest at campfiresshop at shopsand then hopefully the deck grows into something cohesive enough to challenge the bosses of the Spire Mechanicallyits quite simple  deal enough damage to reduce the enemys health to zerouse Defend cards to protect against incoming attacksand your deck reshuffles when you go through the whole thingthe game uses this mechanical simplicity as a rocksolid foundation to build complexity and depth Cards like Draw a card Discard a card can become the absolute foundation of a deckwhile a card like Deal 32 damage can be an absolute dead draw depending on your other card picks Relicspassive bonuses to your characteradd another layer to consider You have a relic that lets you keep drawing cards when you empty your hand  should you focus on cost cards and eliminate your higher cost oneswhen removing cards from your deck is a rare and expensive serviceand while it may not appeal to everyoneits at least refreshing and fun Its a funny game without leaning too hard into humorits a cute game without leaning into weeb cutenessoverall everything is at the least wellmadeif you enjoy roguelikesABSOLUTELY PICK THIS UP
1,Bought this after watching Clarksons Farmthinking I can do better Turns out I cantIm 5 years oldPlayed PC games including Flight Simulator since early 90s This game is TOPS Thank youI really love playing FARM SIMULATORI am 6 years old and I feel like a 12 year older playing thisI am a full time farmer in REAL LIFERide horsesraise cowschickens duck fish pigs sheep goatsWHAT ELSE CAN I SAYREAL FARMING IS A HEADACHE SOME TIMESSOME TIMES YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH  FSTHE SOLUTION IS THE SAME FOR BOTHJUST FIX ITTHANK YOU GIANTS Since I have played this game a slight amountlet me give you the general run downyou gradually build up to bigger and faster equipmentadding more and more land as you expand Then you get bored Then you start a new map Then you run out of stock maps and decide to give mods a try At this point you are irredeemableyoure like me Sitting on 1350 hours and 5 completed farms and youre lonely So you thinkah I know Ill involve my friendsget everyone on the same page and generally enjoy your time Everyone finds their own little niche and does well working together Then one by one they fade awaybecause theyre not addicted like you areand they find doing the same thing over and over a bore and repetitive because they dont have a second monitor to watch videos on the side or listen to their perfectly crafted motivational farming music playlist like youand youre always browsing the mods and watching farming simulator videos on YouTube to see if theres any new maps that catch your eye Ohand of courseyoull preorder the new one as soon as its announcedbecause who knows what new lands youll tameId never really understood the desire to play a video game about doing work Car Mechanic Simulator was a fun gimmickbut Farming Simulator That just sounds ridiculous and it isrewardingand enjoyable Theres a lot more than just farming too Theres the aspect of building a farmlaying out where buildings will goorganizing tractorstrucksand tools Theres the whole financial strategy part too do i buy this tractorlease itor continue to use the old basic piece of junk for another harvest or twoand should i plant corn and turn it into silageor plant soybeans for profitmaybe plant oat and bale the straw afterwards Its just crazy how much honestly goes on in a simple simulator And with modsthis game can even become a farm manager game as you send workers out to plowcultivateharvesttransport cropetcgetting stressed and frustratedbut then come home and relax as I just let the tractor drive lines up and down a field plantingor use a harvester to collect cropsand its just so damn easy to get lost inbut this is honestly one of the best games Ive put my time into I mean568 hrs at this point in time Its worth every pennyI got this game cause i want to feel like Jeremy ClarksonAfter playing for just a couple hours I already couldnt even imagine going back to FS1 80 hours laterfarming still feels better than it ever did before Good job Giants Dno Herculean strength to flip tractors with a piece of wood and able to rotate items inhand Looking forward to conventional balers at this pointsteering feels much more realistic using keyboardyou can feel youre driving a several ton piece of machinerysuspension and ground response better than everinstead they have wear and tear that you have to fix for a small fee similar to what Seasons mod did in FS1resulting in massive decrease in passive running cost for the farm idle vehicles dont cost youlandfield expansion feels more natural with having to buy the land Buy a forestcut down the trees and turn it into farmlandalthough placing stuff on anything but a very flat ground can cause issues Upcoming terraforming feature will fix thatpotentially Also choice of buildings in base game is limitedbut Im sure modding community fill flood the game with dozens of new items soongreatly expanding on the fertilize 3 times approach from FS1more stuff to do between sowing and harvesting phaseshorsessugarcane for those without FS1 platinum All with their own mechanicsmachinery More variety of stuff to doeven if cotton is pretty bad profit compared to other cropsmuch less clunky although somewhat buggy at the moment weeds will overtake NPC fields permanentlyas eggs will spawn in boxes without having to collect them manually Placeable animal pens require higher initial investment in livestocksimilar to buying fields for arable farmsfull 3D preview of machinery and its configuration Does this tractor look silly with narrow tires and painted pink Did that trailer have a hitch on the back or not Ill just look and seegame feels to be running smoother than FS1 too Big improvements in lighting and atmospheric visualsyou can easily see the difference in the overall image and feel of the game Beautiful sunsets and night lights engine sounds stand out much more than in FS1much cleanermore readable and compactseem to miss less parts of a field on angled edges thoughit seems aiming the cuts is less intuitivepieces of wood can still get glitched after cutting weird collision box and mass and still missing any sound when a massive tree falls down Need that satisfying creeeeeakTHUDnone are too serious or gamebreaking as far as Ive encouteredIt aint much but its honest workStep 1 Buy gamerealy fun game when you have no friendsIve pissed 356 hours of my life away on FS 1so naturally I bought this game 4 hours before release andthats great I simply dont understand the people leaving negative reviews because the core gameplay is the same What the hell did you expect zombies a battle royale mode Theres only so much you can realisticly do in a game primarly about farming Anywaya sound hiccup when using the chainsawand a visual glitch with rain coming through the cab of certain vehicles Ive also heard about multiplayer connectivity issues but as a single player only person I cant comment  These issues exist as of 112018pedalsect as of 112018so its absence is probably a calculated decisionif youre coming from a heavily modded version of fs1 youll probably be a bit disapointedthe graphics look a bit crisper and cleaner In particularvehicle interiours look a lot less plasticy Hard to descibe but compare fs1 and 19 and its noticableand so far works just as advertisedwhile smallhave alot more detail and are generally more fun to explore than those in base fs1 the devs clearly took insperation from the modding communitytheres a sense of weight behind them now There is however the physics issue mentioned above with pickups as of 112018the biggest new featureyet butstill good DIFFICULTY Background  450 hours in FS151250 hours in FS1give it a few months to work out the bugsweedsfrankly I dont carechanging the API so drastically and not given documentation out early means that we have to wait for the good mods Follow MeCoursePlayGPSbut that is par for the course with smaller dev shops  They had to get money coming in and hit a November release date for the holidaysAhFarming Simulator It all started that one nightbrowsing the Steam store for games on saleand I stumbled upon FS1920 off And I chuckled a bitthinking hahthat would have been funny Sitting herepretending to be farmingwanting to see how people actually played the gameand I watched a guy filling a silage clamp for 45 minutestalking about his dayto purchasing the game  I dont know But here we areover 300 ingame hours later and not feeling a natural stopping point Ive purchased a complete setup  steering wheelpedalstwo joysticks and to top it off  a newly revived YouTube channel where I post my gameplay Im waist deep in this gameand I regret not trying it sooner Its an addicting gamewith a lot of different ways of playing itand thats something you will too if you start playing Make sure you have loving and understanding people around you if you plan on purchasing this game  because youll find a sudden need to tell people around you about farmingI wish my Wifes Father could have seen this Simulation  Graham was  Dairy Farmer in Wiltshire and im sure that he would have enjoyed giving me Tips with my Game Play The only thing missing from this superb Sim is the smell of sun warmed Cow Dung As Graham walked out to meet his Staff he would often be heard to saymy friends make fun of me for playing this game but I recommend this gamegood game i have modded this game and i am now a humble canadian cannabis farmerPress R and you can pet the dogsWellover 3000 hours played  Trust me  Its a good gameFrom casually puttering around a couple of small fields and using low cost low power equipment and driving your meager harvest to market to giant harvesting machines with collectors so large you cant drive them on the roads must tow them semi trucks and large capacity trailers to haul the larger machines bountiful harvest to market farther and faster maybe you want to grow cotton or tend a flock of sheep ride some horses or fill a tanker with milk   youll need to feed these animals and thats where the game starts to shine as you start to explore more and more crops and farming types as you earn more money you can buy more fields more buildings to house your growing fleet of machinery  and then you discover modding and we go from mom and pop roadside stand crops to consumer product manufacturing with custom buildings that take your raw crops turn them into ingrediants then you then take to another place to manufacture soda other drinks coffee theres many more what about cutting down trees for profit theres a whole sub genre of mods and maps made specifically for logging then we have mining and using what mines produce to make other things to make other things to make other things to build more buildings to make other thingswant to use all the functions that some materials offer but the game lacks using mods exist to expand all facets of the farming industry and beyondas all games eventually do those hiccups get ironed out and then the modders start going to town dozen new mods a day it seems are released to the in game mod hub alone  thats what gives this game its legssmall old timer farms and tractors like your grandparents usedor to take wood products to to make more wood productsor about this game i highly suggest giving this one a go before i discovered farming simulator in the 2015 version purchased in 201 and before that point i was a driving sim kind of person with a heavy lean to online shootersand a side thing for massive mmorpgs and single player giant explorable world rpgs but farmsim has always been an interesting and fun experience

is that well never get to experience it for the first time againThe Witcher 3 Wild Hunt reviewworth every penny ✔and you become connected to all the characters asif they really were your familyit is a masterpieceCD Projekt Red actually make finished uncut gamesplus DLCSI am 75 years old and really enjoyed this game In this game I could do all the things I was once able to do but in my twilight years can no longer do There should be more games like this for us seniors The graphics were exellent I very much dislike and dismiss the cartoon type graphics in most other games The visual aspects of the game were superbrealistic and sometimes even breathtaking The attention given to detail needs to be congratulated The storyline was only just satisfactory but this was complemented by all the interesting charecters involved Please continue to amaze us gamers with your excellent workThe best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and the second part of The Witcher You simply wont find anything that hasnt changed for the bettereven despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgradestill makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever createdit finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1something that makes you forget thats just the video gameit gives you the feeling you are in therein some villagecity or that you are fighting with someone  somethingwhich turns every single battle into an unforgettable memoryand believe methere is A LOT of themis actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests  I call it  a new quality in RPGsfinally a game dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at allits decentthough its nothing to be praised reallyyou wont be able to mash buttons and win  you have to dodgeuse signsand on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his or her miseryalthough nothing that cant be fixed  some balance issueseconomy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person who he should not besmall performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content fixed by the expansions Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose themone of the best games in the last few years even a decadeThere is a reason why The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt has an average rating of around 98 The storytellingthe graphicsthe atmospherethe voice actorsthe overall scope of the gamethe soundtrack and almost everything else is absolutely stunning and TOP NOTCH Ive been playing the same savegame for almost 100 hours now and I still havent finished the main storyline and sidequests of the main game Where else do you get so much game content for your moneythe game has some small weaknesses and bugsbut considering what you get in the Game of the Year Edition for a price of only 1499 € during the Holiday Sales for example is simply amazingbut make sure to install the The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project mod can be found on Nexus Mods as well It makes the game look even better while not asking for too much more performance from your PCnor do I like writing reviews on Steambut this game is a solid 9810You know how when you complete a good TV show or book series you always feel empty cause you got attached to the characters and you know you will never enjoy their company againThe only bad thing about this game is the emptiness you feel after finishing it28 years of gamingthis is the greatest game I have ever played and likely will ever play  Bought it on release day in 2015 and came here todau just to write this because someone asked me at work today if this game was any goodand I can never experience it fresh again It may have ruined all future games I will ever playA game where side quests are more entertaining then other games main storiesSince playing this I have a legit fear that there wont be any game like this anymoreSo we got a game in 2015the complaint of which for many people was overwhelming contenta game that wanted to push boundaries in terms of narrative and choiceconsequence based decision making in a living and breathing open worldwith characters that are memorable and relatable A game whose developers knew what gamers wanted WItcher 3 has launched CDPR into the league of great developers like Looking GlassRockstarValveoldBioware etcits not even funnyMy personal Game of the DecadeSilver for monsters 🗡️I bought this game for 15€ on a saleshould have bought it for full priceJust fcking buy it alreadynot greatits on sale for 20I quit cocaine to play Witcherso I did and became obsessed and didn’t even want to leave my room to score drugs and stop my cold turkey withdrawals because I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ playing Gwent and winning By the time I was finished with the game I didn’t crave snack anymore I just wanted more witcher contractsPlayer Basesroam around with it and take the perfect shotas said previously beautiful landscapesso many details and great immersionvast character buildseasy to learn but takes some time to masterthe more you will need to grindmany emotional moments and lots of lore to exploreit does helpscreenshot lovers will love itthat I sometimes feel like Im living the adventure with Geraltyou can hear the b wind howling banimal noises and even tree branches crackling There are just so many details
1,Rebirth is an amazing game It improved on flash Isaac in almost every single way you can imagine and has served as a platform for a lot of new content to be added to the game People have strong opinions about the way the game has developed since its releasebut theres no denying that Rebirth itself was a slam dunk and a grand slam One of the best roguelites ever madeand a huge inspiration for other developers in the genre ever sinceThis games greatest strength is its replayability and sustaining value It may be one of the highest hourtodollar ratios in singleplayer gamingyou will love the way this game continues to challengeand challengeand challenge furtheryou will be continuously pleased every time you find a cool new rooma gamechanging itemcrazy synergies between those itemsand the games plaethora of well hidden secretsthis game will not only please you with the gargantuan number of achievements on displaybut also in how the game integrates them with the core gameplayrewarding you with ingame unlocks for almost every single achievementwhereverand enjoy a short but enjoyable gaming sessionthis game is perfect If you are in this categorybuy it on the Switch if you have onethat becomes very disheartened by dying or losingis squeamish around gross imageryor who doesnt want to have to look things up onlinethen you might find this game doesnt suit your tastes One feature common amoung content rich games like thisDont Starve or Minecraft is that they are often very hard to penetrate due to their emphasis on experimentation and unexplained featuresrequiring wiki usageand other McMillen games like Super Meat Boy often deter those that justifiably claim This game is too hard or This game is gross While very fun and rewarding to the kinds of gamers listed aboveand highly recommendeddo beware that if you are in this categoryI do not recommend this gamewhat no father figure does to mfMy first attempts at The Binding of Isaac resulted in me repeated dying in the first room I entered Almost 2 hours later in game I can now sometimes survive as the lost Despite the frustration of dying A LOTthe challenge of getting further and further in game was what kept me returning day after day Two years later it is still my most commonly played gameDiptera Sonata  Ascension Chest Fighthard at times game with a lot of charm Its given me quite literally thousands of hours of enjoymentBinding of Isaac Rebirth is a remake of Binding of Isaac with new graphicsnew mechanicsnew monstersnew items and every aspect of the game has been enhanced New content has been added everywhere possiblethe game feels infinitely smootheris so much nicer to playand has many more hours of content to keep you satisfied for longer If you enjoyed the original Binding of IsaacBinding of Isaac Rebirth is going to be infinitely better and I can promise instant satisfaction This review will consist of comparisons between the original and Rebirthwhat’s goodwhat’s badpossible changes and just an overall look at various aspects of the game including everything that comes to mind It is often a bit ramblybecause I talk extensively about every detail I like and every component that irks me For a full recommendation of the game and a continuation of the reviewvisit the last paragraphwhere you find various items which can be beneficialharmful or simply useless to your overall goal of surviving You shoot the enemies with your tears to kill them while running away from them and their tears to avoid taking damage Once you diethat run is over The game is permadeathso you have to start again from scratch The game is also absolutely bdisgustingb There isn’t too much bloodbut knowing that these monsters have lived in your dusty old basementbeen transformed into ugly mutilated creatures and that this is what becomes of you as you take pills and pick up items is gross Once you get past the horrid enemiesthe game is pretty simple and is extremely fun to all who like the challenge of a game like thisall of which have different unique aspects Some characters are easier to play than otherswhich in the eyes of many peoplemakes those characters more fun I wish the characters were more balancedbut it’s very rarely possible to have 1 different characters you can play as that all play with equal difficulty There are bound to be some easiermore fun and more interesting charactersand that’s what makes them unique Something that’s missing from the classes howeveris all the characters being unique Some of the playstyles of the characters feel too similarand some of the things that made characters unique in the original Binding of Isaac have disappeared in Rebirthan interesting aspect of Samson that made him a challenge in the original game Ratherhe starts with 3 red heartsprobably to accompany the change in the item of Bloody Lust making it a damage output increase relative to the amount of damage taken for the entire floor This is an interesting changebut it makes Samson more of a tanky charactersimilar to Magdalenerather than the weaker character with more potential I believe a better change would have been to give Samson a spacebar item and keep his stats the same as they are in the originaland the effect of Bloody Lust relative to the amount of kills you get while still maintaining it’s effect over the floorthe item that made Cain a fun character to play in the originalhas been significantly nerfedmaking Cain a character that lacks a truly unique aspect While Lucky Foot is still a luck upa single luck increase does not have much of an effect as most items that use luck to work require a lot of it to work extremely well If the Lucky Foot could still make the Fortune Machine work all the timeor at least most of the timeand increase the luck stat by multiple points rather than just oneCain would be a much more interesting character to play and much more uniquewith a bunch of items now using the luck stat to perform more efficientlyall methods of gambling in the game being affected by luck and it now being shown on the pause screen when you press escape They’ve also shown all the statsincluding shot speed and luck as previously mentionedon the pause screenwhich were not there in the original gamewhich wasn’t too bad in the original but in this game there is no ‘tell’ something that means he’s going to do a certain attack for when he is going to shoot itand before you can move out of the waythere is a laser and you’ve been hit The same thing applies to the Lumps in the womb and the Mom eyes in the red champion Mom fightwhich shoot instantly upon popping up and you have no time to react to the high speed shot There are a lot of enemies that do similar thingsand still a lot of rooms remain where it’s almost impossible to leave without taking damageand a lot of similar aspects like that It makes the game more uniformbecause now there are a lot more interesting spiders which were missing from the original game and a lot of new versions of both flies and spiders which add a lot to the challenge of learning new elements of the gameclose the gameand start again from where you left off at a later point You can’t start another run while in the middle of a previous one without overriding the previous run’s databut it’s still an extremely useful featuresince in the previous game we had to leave the game running to continue a round of BoIbut they can now be a single normal roomas all the rooms were in the original BoIthey can be double rooms extended either horizontally or verticallyand they can even be quadruple rooms that extend in both directions The animation for travelling through such rooms can apparently cause motion sicknessand it can be turned off by changing something in one of the files I’m not quite sure what PersonallyI quite like the animationand it makes moving around large rooms extremely funthis game is easily worth the 15 if you liked the original Binding of Isaacand at the time of the making of this review there was no DLC released if there ever will be anyso that might be added in the future This is an action packed permadeath roguelike with infinite replayability and hundreds of hours of gameplay to unlock all the achievements and secrets As Steam limits the size of community reviewsyou can find the rest of my review burlhttp1drvms1xjvRiGhereurlbI go overI hate The Bloati hate the little red spiders so much its unrealThis game makes me want to kill myselfthis happened to my buddy EricToday I FINALLY got 1 achievementsso I think it makes sense to finally write this review  Ive sunk well over 1hrs into this game spread over several yearsand I can confidently say that none of those hours were boring  There were definitely more than a few playthroughs where I wanted to tear my hair out in frustrationbut the fun and excitement of making it to the end with the perfect item combinations makes it very rewarding as well  If anythingthis game definitely has high replay valuesoundtrackand of course the awesome gameplay  I think I am most impressed by the way some really disgusting and disturbing things were made to look really cutethis is one of those rare titles that far exceeds its hype  Highly recommended The amount of stuff to grab and to doinsaneshadowsetcI love this gamealot It

1,Teleporting 30 corpses into the boss roomthen casting mass corpse explosion to instantly kill the boss is a perfectly valid way to play the gameLets see000 or so lines of dialogue in time for the release Seriouslythe game is FULLY voice actedevery NPCno matter how insignificant has a voice That is somewhere in the area of 0000 voices lineswhere a lot had to be recorded  times for each one of the player voicesThis game is the greatest middle finger to all the moneygrubbing AAA games out there Its reasonably pricedits intelligentit gives freedom to your epic adventureand last but not leastthis game doesnt have any lootbox and microtransaction nonsenseHOLY SHIT this game its one of those games where you look at the clock when you sit down at your computerand the next time you check to see what time it is hours have passed and you forgot your dinner and Coronavirus and that you need to go shopping And when you get up from your chairyou cant wait to come back and get sucked into the world again like wtf kind of magic is this  Im not even a fan of turn based RPGS Db♦ One of the best cRPG out thereif you are a fan of roleplaying gamesthis is definitely a must buyb For those who never play thier first gameno worriesalthough they take places in a same universeeach has a standalone story This one starts thousand years after the first one so you are not missing anythingslowpaced but really interactive with many different elemental combinationscool interactions between each abilities and your surrounding environmental even statuses are interestingany kind of liquid waterbloodpoison left on the battleground can reacted to Air turning it into a pool of Electricity deal damage and stun anyone in itb Stone Armor not only increase your physical armor but also stop you from bleedingburning because you are solid rock Peace Of Mind is the kind of ability that let you see a bigger picturesit provides stats buff and cure Blindness BUT also remove frenzy status Ragebecause the target have become more wise so no more bold actions Rage on the otherhand is also another status which increase damage output but at a great cost of defense downb say if someone go invisible and there is happen to be rainingthat sneaky guy will be revealed because hes wet And because water react violently with electricityhe will be taking increased Air damage but will take less damage if you throw a fireball at him Walking through frozen ground and you may trip and get knocked down Standing on high ground will make your spellsabilitiesitems reach further with increased damagelistLeech turn you into a vampire allowing you to heal when standing near blood or Zombie make Poison heal you instead but normal healing will damage you Because the game is classlessyou can be anyonemix and match anything you likeyou may be born a warrior but dream to be a magego learn some magic and become a battlemage Who says warrior cant be sneakygo ahead and get yourself some rogue abilitiesb it has a great balance between combat and talking with rich dialogues and occasional silly humors You can play as different races HumanElfDwarfUndead and Lizardyeah thats rightyou can become a Lizard that spits out Fire Each races have different racial skill and special powerNPCs may also reacttalk differently to you depend on your race There are also different original characters ingame who have thier own storygoals and personalites for you to playbut if you want to create your own characterthe game also offer many different origins which called tags SoldierScholarOutlawetc which plays a part in dialogue The Origins will remain in your game as companion and you can have different perspective on them through dialoguesquestline which is really cool imothere is also a relationship system ingame not fully included in EAwill be in full game which can create intense rivalryfriendshipenmity and romancethe game looks greatits colorful most of the times and can be dark when needed to beinfact the DOS 2 is meant to be darker and much more focused than the previous oneb Having finished Act 1 in EAthere are no fetch quests and unrelated to the storylineall of them is connected one way or anothereach tell you a story about the games world and ultimately leading to a bigger picture You can finish quests in different waysany path is a progressionyoull never feel getting stuckthere are always different paths to takethings to do Oh a mazeim not in the mood to solve puzzle atmlets jumpfly through itdont have wings Look aroundtheres maybe some other hidden pathsshortcut or go do some questline maybe some of them will shed some lights of the Maze making it easier to go throughits an cprg game and its RICHb Just look up the crafting list in DOS 1and  before there were just a combination of two itemsin DOS 2 you can have a combination of total 5 items Here comes the great partyou can craft new skills by combining books of different schools You can turn a normal rain into a mean blood storm Mixing a Pryo spell with Necromancyyou can make corpses explode dealing massive damage to nearby targets as if you cutting thier buddies down wasnt enoughthe devs also offer alot of tools for easier time making your own dungeonyou can control anythingthe statsthe weathermusicdialougeseventsetc and you can even do it on the fly You can take a quick look of the mode burlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvSNxDMZhiGtUthereurlb a GM Mode game hosted by Matt Mercerfeel free to check my videosbTalked to a chicken that claimed he was a mighty wizard Called him a liar Hilarity ensures This game is awsomeIt seems Ive never written a review for DOS2and with the Steam Awards wanting us to update a reviewI might as wellthis isnt a game thats easy and laid back This is the game that throws you in the middle of a world and tells you to figure it outso if tactical turnbased combat isnt your strongest suit there ARE easier modes for you But the harsh combat isnt the only thing that makes this game hard Its the queststhe worldthere is NO handholding You got to figure out what to doyou got to figure out which quest to solve and focus on And boy are there many quests to focus onsome seem like just a typical sidequest kind of job that ends up being the key ingredient in solving the big mystery I love thatI love that the first act has you stuck on an islanda jailand your job is to break out And how would one do this There isnt just one wayor twoor three There are more than that Way more And its up to you to figure out the wayhumandwarfelflizardand undead Each brings with their own talents and experience in the game You might have trouble with certain quests because they hate your raceyou might need to find another way into a town because they dont like dwarves Its extremely immersiveand playing it as a coop makes it even soI played this on Tacticalwhich is hardand on some boss fights me and my coop partner would sit here for two hours Reloading Repositioning Changing skills Reloading over and over untill we finally managed to beat said boss It was one of the most amazing experiences Ive had in gaming all year Just that little bit of having to figure out how something workscheer him up and hell help you That nasty fire elemental Guess what She needs your helpand people dislike you because of itbut somehow they managed to make the entire game voice actedwithout starting another kickstarter and without pushing the game back a few months It was a surprise untill launch and I give them major props for doing thisi know Fort Joy better than my own FlatI thought I would put down some of my thoughts on the game after over 150 hours of playtimeyou immediately realize that its taking a lot of cues from very oldschool RPGs You pick one of several classes for your character BattlemageClericEnchanterFighterKnightRangerRogueShadowbladeWayfarerWitch and Wizardpick a few skills to go with itand customize the look of them Youre then thrown into the worldtrodding along a beach where you find many interesting things about the gameuntil I made my mind and went for my final settingsWhy am I picking up these shells and couldnt really explain whyaside from thats just what I do in games with loot Soon afteryou come across your first fightand this is where it differs greatly from most other RPGs out therewith each member of the fighton both sideshaving their turns in a set order the order can be affected by turnskipping status effectssuch as being frozen or stunned Each characterwhether yours or AIcontrolledhas a set number of action points they can use for their turn You can move to a better positionwhack a nearby enemycast a spelletc These all take up your action pointsbut you are able to end your turn early and save those action points for the characters next turnand its a tough one It feels incredibly oldschool in its level of difficulty and really rewards players who go around gaining XP through exploration and sidequestsas well as those who are extremely skilled in thinking out how exactly to approach a fightso you conduct electricity a bit better There could be poison on the ground that could effect where you need to run All of these can be affect by the player as well Wanting the enemy to stay at a range Throw down an ice spell so they have a chance to slip and fall on their backs if they try to move closer to you Enemies are coming into melee range Perhaps throw a firebomb in their path to start them burning and cause damage to them before they even get close Its a fascinating system that Ive never seen before in the gameand it makes every encounter so deep that you find yourself scanning the environmentyour inventoryyour spells and your party set up just to see what is possible for that fighttheres little to no handholding or help Your quest log is literally a journaldescribing your heroes journey so far in their own mindsessentially It makes you explore and thinkrather than blindly follow a marker to find your next objective This resulted in me getting lost repeatedlyfor a great deal of timein the very first city of the game The number of side quests I picked up was staggeringand the lack of direction just made me try to think outside of the box to try and find any way to progress with my murder investigation There are even some incredibly fun encounters you can run across in your time with the gamewhich has a wonderful sense of humour about iti have found Tactician mode fun and challenginghas a ton of contentand is a blast on your own or with a friend  I highly recommend this gameDnD for when you dont have friendsYou will love this game ifif you dont sit there scrolling over the map looking for hidden chestsladdersledgesetcyoure doing it wrongturn based combat that rewards forward thinking and planningusingselling or collecting lootor really focusing on the bugslets get realor have line of sight on a target they clearly should0 chance to hit is more like 30 anything under 90 is troublethe real fun comes from exploring the world and finding everything else there is to do I honestly cant believe how good this game is for an EA release and I cant wait for the full release come September Could not recommend highly enoughI knowmore synergy between spells This is already greatbut why stop at greatthe more I realise Im just asking for more of the game Give me more of the game mateThis may just be the best game I have ever played I hadnt played the first Divinity Original Sin gamebut I purchased this because I enjoy rpgsturn based gamesand games that can be played local coopbut never did I expect what came next  my girlfriend liked it too We played this game every day for weeks and weeksloving the explorationexpansive storyand difficult but rewarding combat Finally we beat the gameafter maybe 200hrsin what was a campaign where we thoroughly explored every corner of the game So then we bought Divinity Original Sin 1beat thatthen started a lone wolf campaign on 2beat thatand still we were finding stuff we missed through the first playthrough I seriously cannot recommend this game enough Alsothe aforementioned girlfriend is now my wifeand I am not saying that is because of Divinitybut it certainly didnt hurtI was tired of games that only tests your reaction skill I was tired of games that say its 60 dollarsonly to have randomized loot boxes or microtransaction implemented later in time I was tired of games that were advertised to be wide as an ocean but ended up being shallow like a puddlewe cannot wait to identify it to see who can make use of the item Quests are a joy to do and often leads you to find more quests thats filled with important decision making Every choice you make has an impact on the world and I have been sent to jail multiple times for making the wrong decision For 4499 you are not buying a game but an experience An experience to truly go on an epic adventure Fights are never easy but once you learn the satisfaction of besting the enemy combatant that you failed to take down multiple timesyou are left leaving for more glory Currently playing on Tactician Modedepthand quality give this

replayability for those who wish to know what would have happened if they had answered something else than FIIIIIIIIIIIIGHTand I repeatthe fact of being able to play with friends makes the game so

with only one save file Not afraid about losing itif your team is wiped out Thenthis product shall satisfy thy needs As the Master of PainI guarantee itthere is nothing bad I can say about this one Reallynothing whispers Nothing At Alland a reference point for future RPGs1 Buy gameh1Mind  Blownh1and probably up there in my list of most favorite games of all time My mind was completely blown every step of the way through this fantastic journeystart to finishliving world You can see how much love and work when into this So much to exploreso much to see So many little secrets tucked away here and there Not to mention while in combatevery single turn needs to be thought out depending on the enviroment around youweapons and armor is definitely not lackingthen do itgive or take And thats without finishing all the side quests or companion quests The amount of content stuffed into this game will leave you plenty to dowith a few friendswith strangers It doesnt matterbut I can see the appeal to itbut I had an issue finishing a companion quest that was tied into the same NPC as another companion I had Once completedone companion was stuck and could not progress I ended up finishing the game without completing itdoesnt coddle and definitely doesnt hold your handbut taking the time to learn the combat system and all the little bits and pieces is worth every penny from your wallet and every second of your timeIm 4  Ive been playing pc games since before Zork  This is the best RPG Ive ever played  This is whatas a kidI had always hoped these games would turn into  Great Job  Great gameThis game is a masterpiece Easily one of the best games I ever played in my lifeyou notice your characters actually develop and become way stronger with each level and each new gear equipmentthey can either help you or turn against you For example your friend could tell the guards that you stole something and they will put you in jail or you can make your friend distract traders and you pickpocket themIf you like turnbased RPGs with lots of customization and a good story to put along with themdo yourself a favor and buy this game This game will leave you wanting more every time you put it down Choices matter Characters are interesting Combat is fluid This is one of the betterif not bestTurnBased RPGs out therefor what youre buyingan extremely generous price They knew the fanbase and what people wanted and how bad they wanted it They still did not take advantage of us Larian Studios has earned my undying support
1,I have played the game for nearly 800 hoursand man I am bad at it But that doesnt keep me from playingbecause its awesome I have read a lot of complaints about campersso let me assure youI am one of those campers Hunt Showdown allows for many a play stylelike rushing in with a shotgunduelling with pistolsor sniping from far away There are at least a dozen weapons which allow a sniper playstyleso dont complain about it I have played computer games for nearly 40 years nowIm 55and I cannot and would not want to compete with the Fortnight Kiddies like my sonsI will continue snipingand I will desperately try to push my KD past 060  a task of herculean dimensionsThis issimply putmy favourite gamechallenging PvPvE game You play as a bounty hunter tasked with killing a high value target in an area infested with some sort of dark magic The only problem isyoure not the only hunter out thereyou kill the targetyou banish the target then you have to escape the map with tokens proving its you who killed itwhich means there will be 10 more people who are intent on stopping you leaving with that bounty And almost everything you do can be heard by everyone else on the mapmeaning you have to move as quickly as you canwhilst going as quietly as necessarywith the right balance of risk and reward Most things you do in a match earn you an amount of cash to take to the next lobbywhere you can then either save for a rainy dayor buy higher tier equipment for your next loadout Butanything you die with is lost to the bayou  hence the risk If your hunter survivesthey get experience and you can use that to buy some traits that make them marginally better for the next run outwhere success leads to a higher probability of success on the next runand so it seems inevitable that the good get better equipment to be even more effective  so how can a new player break inso favours closer quarters fighting The starting shotgun has the longest onehitkill range of all the shotguns Ultimatelyplaying to your loadouts strengths and being better than your opponent has a FAR higher contribution to your success than the exact equipment everyone loaded in withits learning the game There are currently three VERY full mapseach of which is absolutely crammed with minutiae Its about knowing how to move around compounds without triggering sound traps quickly Its about knowing which directions youre actually vulnerable from Its about knowing which sort of gun can shoot through that wooden wall you know theyre crouched behind Its about knowing that when the shot sounds like THATthat means its this specific gun and how far away they are The burden of knowledge you have to accumulate to become proficient is very highas a potential buyerhave to considerthere is nothing like this gameand listen to and implement suggestions from the community very proactively They are continually improving the game and adding loads of content I have bought a lot of the cosmetic DLCpurely to support the teamas I have gotten way more out of the game than the price I paid to get inI keep coming back to Hunt As long as there are other hunters to go up againstI think I might never stopThis is an OLD REVIEW that has been updated to the full release version of Hunt Showdown Many things have changedand the review is horribly outdatedso I have done my best to include all of the new updates in the reviewdepsite the lack of NPCs or voice actingeven on low settingsshoot goodand make you feel powerful with each shot Also includes bullet speedand oneshot headshots up to reasonable distances depending on ammo typecomplete with weaponsperksabilitiesand consumables to unlock and equipand a nearendless variety to pair and test out togetherto legends wearing black dusters covered in skullstrinketsand scarsmaking you adapt to their fighting styles and how to counter them effectively Some enemies rush you mindlesslybut others will sit back and try to take you out at a distance The AI is simplebut effective at their jobto crows taking off when people are too close The way the barn creaks when you take a step The distant gunshots and being able estimate how far they are by the sound Everything revolves around soundand the sound is beautifulsurebut you have a reduced ammo pool and ammo replenishment compared to earlier weaponslonger reload timeslonger pauses in between shotsand a higher price point You want to be able to keep an enemy suppressed for days Theres a weapon for that you want to stay calmand pick them off with a singlewellplaced headshot Theres a weapon for that You want a singleaction revolver with a stock and a short range scope Theres a weapon for that for some reasoneither One game you might not hear a peep the entire roundbut the nextgunshots are ringing out from every single direction You never truly know whats going to happen when you drop into the bayouhaving an objective Its what separates this game from PUBG and Escape from Tarkov Having that tangibleeverpresent quest ingamethat requires multiple steps to complete most timesmakes the game into more than a PvP experience Its not something that you can be sneaky about most of the time You have to reveal to EVERYONE where you are to complete your objectiveand whether or not you like the amount of content so far 2 different levels with multiple areas to exploredifferent times of day3 unique bossesand a metric ton of challenges and weapons to unlock through gameplayit can be a real pain if you join with a random partner over and over There is also the choice of playing with group of 3 rather than 2but can be opted out of if you would just like to play in a duo This depends on whether or not you have someone to play the game withand I would highly recommend picking it up if you have a confirmed partner to play withbut the variety isntwith only 3 bosses to go after This depends on whether you really care about the boss fightsor whether its the PvP and world that interests youyou need a beast of a rig to run this thing properly It doesnt mean that you wont be able to playbut youll be confined to playing on lower settings Not a huge loss overallbut some people are all about dem gwaffics and framerates The game seems to be getting more and more optimised with each updateso itll hopefully only get better from herebecause its a tough one to cover in a few sentenceswhich is understandablesince the map is massive The ingame loading of objects and enemiesisnt Having a hotspot be completely void of lifethen spawn in 3 tough AI enemies 30 feet away both ruins the immersion and your planning from time to timeother people can still join with a partnerputting you at an obvious disadvantagemaking solo play quite difficult You do get a bonus for doing thisbut it normally wont apply to yousince youll end up dead Not impossible to dobut takes a lot more skill with a meagre offering to balance it outwhether it be textures getting brokenrewards not loading properlyor server disconnects Every update seems to play around with something unintentionalwhich is probably thanks to the spaghetti code thats held together with masking tape and wrapping paper Expect a few weird occurrences to pop up from time to timethere is a lot of trialanderror you will be doingand you will be stomped into the mud Over and over I would definitely suggest watching tutorials or videos on youtube on how to actually playbecause there are quite a few concepts that arent explained anywhere ingame When should you shoot AI How does poison work exactly Why did someone throw a lantern at my dead friend This isnt Call of Duty You wont know everythingand it will be the death of you Shrug it offgrit your teethand jump back in for revengea large amount have found the mentality of This game has been ruined by those filthy icasuali gamers due to new updates from the devs It hasnt really been casualizedbut has been made different from what it once was Balancing is a fickle thingand some people would still rather have the game be reverted back to the 06 updateor even the 01 alphasteam forumsor elsewhereare going to be coated in people complaining about how base mechanics and weapons are overpoweredwhile others claim that theyre underpowered Burning a downed hunter which slowly removes him from the match unless his teammate revives him in time is vilified by a lot of people in this game They cite it as an unfair and stupid tacticlabelling the people who do this instaburners Then you have the crowd who oppose this ideasaying Is there any reason to not give yourself an obvious advantage over your opponenttense momentswhere you run and gun your way through the woods to extraction But youll also have times where the gameplay slows to a crawlbecause 2 teams refuse to move The team inside the house knows thatwith their shotgunstheyll be at a disadvantage if they leave their cover to take on the rifle users outsideand the team outside realises the opposite Thereforeboth teams sit on their hands for 30 minutes without doing anything This gameplay scenario is looked down upon from every anglebut its because people want the other group to make a mistake Both teams are technically making the right decision you decide on how you want to playnot the communitydespite its flawsthe game is surprisingly stableand surprisingly funfor those who can run it I would suggest picking it upbut I would also suggest picking it up with a friendor be prepared to get destroyed your first few gamesAlright so this was my second experience in the game and I can say it was one of the most epicintense and emotional rollerocasters I have ever experienced in a game I will split this in two partsBOSS RUN and EXTRACTIONhave small gunfight with players who eventually disappearand tensions are already building upthe last gunfire echoes from the boss chambers and everything goes silentgo to beneath the boss room and hide in a corner for some timeso they dont camp his body anymore and I run to him to get him upwe can fight the boss or haul ass  its your call  say I to my friendI take out my dynamite stick and with a price bait from my friendI throw it directly in its mouthobliterating the remainder of its 30 in one shotand the next 3 minutes are the longest in existanceopen the second floor door and jump down the rivernot looking behind usbut as soon as we approach the point we get shot uponits too risky herenot startling the crows and killing some minor zombos while always paranoic that someone might shoot us in the back of the headlooking out for mecover each other and generally became best buddies over the course of the  gameI see the horses thereand the next 10 steps to the location give me the most notorious feel of relief  WE MADE IT  I scream  NO ONE IS HERESURELY NO ONE DARTED ACROSS THE ENTIRE MAP JUST TO CAMP HEREas he can taste the sweet deserved victory closing on uswhile I run around  good game my friendwe did good we m10 meters20 metershes gonna dieit was all for nothing  I think to myself as I keep hearing gunshots in the distancethats what id dosuddenly the gunshots stopas I see the distance from my friend closingI immediately pull out my syrenge as he takes cover and starts shooting covering shots towards the forest where we got shot fromrisking your life for meI hope to see you again some dayBought this hoping for something a bit less stressful than Escape From TarkovRead other peoples reviews to get an idea of how good this game is mechanically What I rarely see discussed is how well  Hunt Showdown works as a social experience Because you are playing with only one or two players at once and there is a fair amount of down time between fightsyou spend a lot of time just chatting Its easy to make new friends in random queuemost of my steam friends list comes from this game As you play youll gain characters and moneybut youll also lose those things in the blink of an eye Friends last longer and they are more valuableAt 666 hoursI feel able to give a reasonableenough review for folks looking into this gameit teaches you how NOT to play the game well  But if you have a friend whos familiar with the gameor if you watch a few streamersYouTubersyoull quickly get a feel for this gameedgeofyourseatbrutally realistic action as inone bullet from someone you dont see or hear ends your match  Its a game about stealthmovementand strategythey dont craft cheap DLC to belch out Ive bought most of it just for the money  Theres arguments that some skins are PAY TO WIN because they might disappear into the forests better  I find this is generally untrue for seasoned playersand feel like the devs are working ahrd to keep the community happy and the game thrivingyou dont win  you just live to die another dayThis game has always looked interestingbut id read about the hardcore playerbase destroying everyone else and kind of put it on hold to play other stuff Recently i finally made the plungeand its been fantastic The beginner experience has not been nearly as bad as i expectedand we have killed teams and extracted with bounties plenty of times so farand its always exhilaratinggloomy and monstrouswith amazing 3D design and 2D art for things like perks The gameplay is relatively slow and methodicaland you gotta weigh the value of your actions like shooting and running before you perform themwhile still keeping pace This is pronounced more by the long reload timesand the amazing audio design Everything you do makes noise to varying degreeswhich makes you a player magnet if you decide to run and gun or fuck up and make noise by accident Sound in this game is your best friend and your worst enemyand learning how to use it to your advantage is super cool and will improve your chances the mostso this is just me trying to peddle it to you Big recommendationSuper great atmospherea stealth MP that worksthe best soundbased stealth mechanics maybe everyou wont be disappointedSeriouslythis game has ruined me It is in my opiniondespite its issuesone of the best multiplayer shooters of all time The gameplay loopthe tensionthe tactical optionsthe gunplaythe graphicsthe stressthe thematicsthe teamworkthe freedom of playstylethe attention to detailthe skill ceiling and THE SOUND DESIGN all just blend together to make the most unique and wonderfull gaming experiences Ive had in my life The developers really have their ear to the ground and do their absolute best to balance and serve the community to the best of their abilities This feels like a love childand it is nurtured I recommend this game to anyone who is even remotely interestedand I promise it will deliver if you are up for getting beamed in the face during your ever so expanding learning experience The playerbase is growing with every month and it fills me with joyas this game really deserves all the love it gets Dont get me wrongits a HARD fucking game But it is truly worth it I just passed my 1300 hours of playtime and I dont see myself stopping anytime soongo for the head and have fun SOLID 910Pros  You get to Yeehawthe most underrated game ever steadily increasing to the population it deserved right from the startGenre  FPS Western Horror Battle Royale with Strong PvE elements50 have been quite the oppositeand this is where the game falls down Someone shooting you as you soon as you spawncamping at the top of stairs with a shotgunor at the extraction point killing you 1 second away from safety Make this game more frustrating than funthis ticks so many boxesso I am giving it a thumbs upI think the only way to make this game great would be to add a coop PvE mode with optional bots So casual players like myself can choose to have fun and not frustrationJust killed my first enemy Hunter Great experienceFor all my Aussies out there  be aware that this game only presently supports servers in the US and Europe Kinda sucks balls we didnt get the warningbut it looks like it will be quality once if they plan to support us Be awareif laggy playing with Germans \After testing the game for about 100 hours i want to write a reviewfirst of all i went into this game with quite a hypeso my expectations were pretty high and i have to say it lives almost completly up to my hypelets start with the prosid say thats 20 truehunt tries to be its own game with other goals than battle royal gamesthe focus is highly on pvp but you can avoid that and go for the pve experience if you really want towhich sadly results in less xp but i think thats a fair tradethe graphic and detailsspecially for a 30€ game are id say almost insane  but it has a con to it which i will mention lateri didnt expect a witcher 3 map in terms of size but the map in hunt is still big enough for the type of game and for you to feel like youll need hours from point A to Bbut the details in this mapholythis map is so detailed that ive never seen a map where theres so much love and detail in every cornersure there are some areas where you can go under a roots but thats rareeven so detailed that its almost kind of disgusting if you take a closer look at themflesh falling of everywhererotting skin hanging from their body revealing boneshives growing out of the ribcage busting it openmaggots that eat the skin and so onthere arent to much enemytype at the moment and most of them only have small detail changes  hives wear different dresses  but im sure if time goes on they will have a good variety like they have with the basic zimbies gruntsthe hunters are pretty detailed toobesides different skin colors they have different clotheswhich all look super detailed even on medium setting  this coming up as a con later they are all highly detailed in terms of lookfunctions and soundthey are a bit of a con toothe optimization in this game at the moment  there was a perfomance patch so it is a bit better now  isnt that greatif you dont have a highend beast of a pc you wont get to play this game on highest settings with stable 60 or even just 30 fpsmost people will have 3060 on low to middle settings with the average pchas its flawsmost and foremost the difference between tier 1 and tier 3 huntersi dont mean that its op that tier 3s have better camouflage because thats finethe difference in loadoutperks and  starting hp is what makes it hard for tier 1 and 2 hunters to keep up if youre not a highly experienced playerweaponsfor example  the autonagant rarely used due to its price is a close to midrange monster and you wont have any chance fighting someone who has this weapon and knows what he doesthat means that there are hunters who use this weapon 1 in 30 gamespretty rare and wipe the whole server and the price 999 doesnt really make up for it because its quite easy to make that money if there noone leftmost perks are  unlocked at low levels and most of them are almost essential for your hunterbut stuff like the fanning perk  lets you fire a singleaction revolver in a way higher rate of firegoogle fanning for more infos in a game this slowpacedthere should be a downside to moving while aimingbut as it is right nowyour weapon sways just a little and its quite easy to get hitsthey walk from point A to B and only leave their route if theyre alertedim no programmer but i think its possible to implement a point C and then switch up the way they walk maybe just a thoughtim talking about the specter  pumpaction shotgun the dolch autoloading pistol and the mosin nagant  bolt action rifle  they all lose one bullet uppon realoadingthe perk pumpjockey is a fix for the specter but to be honestif you have the perk equiped your hunter will take the unused round and put it back in because without the perk it gets tossed awayi kinda think the perk is a bit unnecessaryfor the other 2 gunswell theres no perk youll always lose one round uppon realoadingim mean technically you could pick them up and put them back in but yeajust a minor thing thats bothering menot gamebreaking or anythingthe game is in a pretty solid placeits a hardcore not really forgiving game that takes some inspiration from the battle royal games and makes them harderits a really fresh wind in the shooter genre with only cod bf like games or battle royalall in all i can recommend this gameTarkovbut I dont wanna kill myself as much Cowboy editionZombies Scary Birds Scary Water Scary Dogs Scary Horses Scary Players Extra scary Good gameI went into this game completely expecting to not be to of my liking and refund itbut I am overwhelmed on how fun this game iswhere I just charge in guns blazing for kills and if I die its fineI respawn I also do not enjoy BRs because you spend a lot of time scavaneging to get killed by a sniper in some corner Hunt not only has that high risk and rewardbut the death is perma ie you lose your hunters and gear when you diethe first few games was brutal and if its your first time in this genreit will be for you too I was playing this game like I play CODsee a guy and then charge hoping to land a kill You CANNOT play this game that way and it was stupid of me to play that way After the first few games I realizedthe games main foxcus is not the shootingits your tactical gameplay I was not happy that the gunfights were so shortbut then I realizedits supposed to be that way coz the game is not about the shootoutits about how you tactically reach to that shgootout Gun fights are not supposed to drag outthe stealthily creeping up to your enemy and landing the pefect shot is what is supposed to drag out The perfect game play is you and your team mates spending a lot of time to get the perfect position and kill your enemy with one shot Thats the fun part Once you realize thatyou will see how fun the game isso you gotta be careful to not step on branchesglasses or scare off the birds coz the enemy will not only know of your existence but will also know where you are coz the directional audio is very accurate Every stepmovementbullet matters and you have to treat it that wayfor ex there are double pistolsshotgunsmelee etc that you can use for a more action packed gameplaybut even that you have to plan out wellHunt Showdown is not a fair gameand thats Okand Counter Strike with their limited maps and short rounds are designed for teams of equally powerful members fighting each otherthan both players have fucked upHunt provides the freedom to change the odds Weapons are not balanced against each other But that is okbecause how you can play can shift the balance in your favorshoot them while theyre climbing laddersreviving or healingshooting something else or reloading

1,Got the game because it sounded like fun just building a raft while adrift in the ocean Then you realize there are objectives and adventures Then you realize its 3am and you have stuff to do in the morning Then you play one more hour to get to a good stopping point Cool gameIts a very fun game to playeven by yourself if you have  friends like meJust finished the gamethe early game is where much of the excitement lieswhile discovering everything for the first timebut after that the both the reason for continuing on and the replay value tanks  Im assuming the devs are planning for content beyond the current endgame stage to remedy thisexcept the shark and the odd clamis not visible in the water  Im catching fish left and right never see one in the wateronce discoveredmake the game trivially easy  These need to be addressedWould I reccommend this game  Yeahyou knowI would  If you can play it with a person  And maybe on easy  Definitely on easy on your ownlistenI know  Youre a proud gameryou dont play crap on easy  I get it  My save game is called easy mode offends me  And yetthere it isthats what I didtheres not a lot of dangerous foes for the most partnot until muchmuch later in the game anyway  I meantheres a sharkyeahso you stay on the raft and stab him in his sharky face when he tries to nibble on your raft  And then lure him into shallow waterthrow bait and repeatedly poke him with sharp sticks until he expires from deathpokereallythe challenge is mostly in managing your hunger and thirst  On normalespecially early in the gameit feels like all youre doing is boiling little thimblesful of water and cooking the tiniest sardines while your character is on the cusp of dying from gothic faminethirst  Its kinda tediousfrankly  So on easythat gets turned down  The shark will still shark you as hard as everthe sardines are just as tiny and the thimbles of water still fail to slake your thirstbut the thirst and hunger meters deplete less quickly so you actually have time to go do other thingsscavenging flotsambuilding up a bigger raft and inventing sharper pokesticks to fend off things  Playing this with somebody is nice because the game is stupendously lonely otherwise Its just youthe oceantiny atolls and occasionally the detritus of somebody who was there years ago and is no longerwhen you have enough technology and youre not purely at the whims of the oceana plot starts to reveal itselfwith places to explore  We love exploringor if you were looking for one of those fashionable TLDRsthis is a slowpaced game but can be kind of relaxing for the most partappreciating the oceanfishing up the tiniest sardinesand slowly wafting to the next adventureRaft is a relaxingoccasionally zenlike experience as you bob on the open oceancollecting resourcescrafting goodiesboth practical and cosmeticand expanding from a single tiny raft into a massive higgledy piggledy self sustaining shipoccasionally stabbing a shark in the face with a spear he deserved it or getting rocks thrown at you by a bird you deserved it The survival elements are fairly simple and I find them welltunedand islands have become more and more exciting to explore as the game development has progressed Theres even a storyline now which is pretty cool the first time you experience it Theres an excellent balance between the peaceful seafaring and island exploring and occasionally battling With the most recent story based updates the game has really expandedalthough its still unfinished and development seems very slowyour friends can drop in or out of your game effortlessly and help you If you should want to let them progress without youwhich I have done a few timesyou can easily send them the file to load Its not quite as good as it being persistently onlinebut its easy enough I played around 4 hours with my husband and a friend and we pulled togetherassigning jobs and positionsworking as a team to explore the ocean and the landbaiting the shark away from the otherstucking unconscious bodies into bedyou knowall the sorts of things friends do for each otherI will warn you that your friendships will be sorely tested when it comes to storage I cannot tell you how frustrating it was to sort every chest into specific categoriespainstakingly labelled with signsand then find that my husband had dropped wood into my seed boxor scuba gear into my food box In the end I told him not to touch any of the boxes except the one with his name on it It staved off divorce I also got yelled at a few times for rearranging the roomsbut reallythese guys have no interior design skills Look Im type A okayI need order on my boateven in the apocalypsebut no one knows when itll pass the finish line and youre just hoping it doesnt have a heart attack en route Im patiently waitingbut I do wish the full experience was ready Its come a long way from releasebut I cant help but feel theres still a ways to goIve really enjoyed my time spent on the game and eagerly look forward to coming back to it next patchso it gets a thumbs up from meplease follow  urlhttpstoresteampoweredcomcurator28971565My Curator Pageurl 💖The gameplay is beautifulcreativeand I enjoyed it But now after 3 years on that raftIm a bit tired I am 53 years oldcan you finish this game before I dieVery chill game Youll start slowbut then once you get collection netsyoull get resources pretty quickly I only wish I had friends to play it with cuz it seems like it would be even better with friends but I just have to say the above was a joke Im too socially awkward to actually try and make new friendsbut I appreciate the attempt XDshark badshark badRight off the bat you can try an early verion of this title for free over at urlhttpsraftitchioraftItchurl This will give you a strong idea of what you are in forand if you go into it with that understanding  you will have a fun enough time With that being saidthe pricepoint here on Steam is certainly not Itchsizedparticularly considering that you are going to have to have friends that play it toothat wont happen here The worst part of this game is that it feels like the developers took notes about how early survival crafting games workedbut could not innovate any further Its all a giant grind that is all too in your face For this pricepoint I expect a bit more nuance and eleganceand there is little done to try to hide itideacontentoptimizationand replay value  Id say its overpriced by about halfFun with friends which I dont haveMixed reviewso I will list the good and badyou are not enough companyAhoy thereMateys Welcome to Rafta survivalcraftingexploringadventure game Here you will test your mettle against the elementswild animals and your own personal shark stalker Yo ho holets get down to business nowthis game has amazing Musicand collect materials to build your Raftso needs some optimizationswind blowingweather effectsthunderlightningI really do like this gamethe music is truly amazing and the game is FUN I love that I can craft and build my own boatexplore and go Island to Islandit just need some polishing and refining to make it even more amazing Please devsnever give upNEVER Surrender Savvy Would I reccommend this game Yeahyou knowI would If you can play it with a person And maybe on easy Definitely on easy on your ownlistenI know Youre a proud gameryou dont play crap on easy I get it My save game is called easy mode offends me And yetthere it isthats what I didtheres not a lot of dangerous foes for the most partnot until muchmuch later in the game anyway I meantheres a sharkyeahso you stay on the raft and stab him in his sharky face when he tries to nibble on your raft And then lure him into shallow waterthrow bait and repeatedly poke him with sharp sticks until he expires from deathpokereallythe challenge is mostly in managing your hunger and thirst On normalespecially early in the gameit feels like all youre doing is boiling little thimblesful of water and cooking the tiniest sardines while your character is on the cusp of dying from gothic faminethirst Its kinda tediousfrankly So on easythat gets turned down The shark will still shark you as hard as everthe sardines are just as tiny and the thimbles of water still fail to slake your thirstbut the thirst and hunger meters deplete less quickly so you actually have time to go do other thingsscavenging flotsambuilding up a bigger raft and inventing sharper pokesticks to fend off things Playing this with somebody is nice because the game is stupendously lonely otherwise Its just youthe oceantiny atolls and occasionally the detritus of somebody who was there years ago and is no longerwhen you have enough technology and youre not purely at the whims of the oceana plot starts to reveal itselfwith places to explore We love exploringor if you were looking for one of those fashionable TLDRsthis is a slowpaced game but can be kind of relaxing for the most partappreciating the oceanfishing up the tiniest sardinesand slowly wafting to the next adventureThe start can be very misleading for the impatient among us it might seem like your only goal is to throw the hook around and gather junk It isnt Once you expand your raft and get the basic needs water and food somewhat coveredthe game will slowly start expanding before youand it usually manages to offer some nice surprises as it doesyou usually canor there is a clever way of doing soonly the first Chapter was released is okayconsidering its revealed to you by means of notesstatic objects and locations Ohand its quite a lot more grim than the colourful visuals suggestyoull get eatenyoull drownyoull get stompedmauled or die of dehydration Id say difficultywise this is somewhat similar to The Long Darkbut quite a lot more forgivinga very chill multiplayer game perfect to play with friends you can go weeks without playingand just pick it up where you left offI really love this game I think you should get it because it has really good graphics and I never have issues with lag I have watched youtubers play the second chapter and it looks really cool From Jakeage 8OutstandingI suggest Suggest to play as 2 players This game is coolno jokeMy wife and I play this game as a unit to see how we can manage tasks better as a couple 11 would recommendRaft is a great twist on the survival game Instead of running around on landgathering materials to build a base and defend ityour entire world is your raftlose it and youre dead You cant just run away from danger and start in a new area I bought two copies so I could play with my teenager and that was some of the best gaming weve done togethervery family friendly but she wouldnt go into the water for the first ten hours so I had to do all the harvesting with Bruce around Little shy on content right now but solid core game play
1,As a retired truck driver of 40 years I never though I would end up playing a game about truck driving but I find it a pleasing experiance when I can travel the European roads which I traveled daily The experiance is so realistic I would recomend this game to all who would like a glimps of the life of a European trucker without all the grind and hardship which goes along with the job Congratulations SCS you have a realistic product even taking into account the suicidal AIThis game is meditationthe thoughtcleansing effect of driving a thousand kilometres along the highway cannot be understated Occasionally poor AI choices behind the wheel may spike your blood pressure but overwhelmingly ETS2 is a relaxing thing to stick on after a rough day And if thats not enough you can just drive into oncoming traffic in your indestructible death machineYou knowit honestly feels like a joke at first There’s thousands of games out there – some offer compelling storylinesothers offer nonstop thrillsand pretty much all of them let us escape the dull monotony and grind of daily life And then there’s Euro Truck Simulator 2 Whichunsurprisinglyis a simulation game where you drive trucks around a crude rendition of Europe Okaaaayyou only need to look at the basic gameplay loop that’s taking place here you pick a job from a list of options in your area You go and hitch up your cargo Then you slowly trundle towards your destinationtaking into account every road law and speed limitand spending the great majority of your time on vast highways and neverending strips of asphalt After dragging yourself to your destination for 20 to 30 realtime minutesyou drop off the cargo – and do the whole thing againthenthat this isn’t for everyone there’s a good chance a few of you have fell asleep merely reading the last paragraph If you do actually get to the point where you boot up the game for the first timeit even does a lot to try and immediately frighten you off You’re instantly met with a plethora of menus that are incredibly overwhelmingallowing you to do everything from create a profile to adjusting your Xaxis sensitivity for Wellsomething The tutorial then doesn’t help mattersbasically stemming down to telling you “Just drive the truck”and then buggering off and leaving you to work out how exactly you do that in the first placethat go way beyond the primal satisfaction that comes with driving a hulking great big rig For onethere’s an incredibly calming sense of slow progression constantly burning away in the backgroundwith the satnav in the corner of your screen always slowly ticking down the miles left towards your destination It’s surprisingly satisfying to watch the numbers keep droppingand finally whittling a distance that seemed impossible to begin with down to nothingtheres the option to turn on your own music while drivingor even tune in to actual radio stations across Europe Set one of these up and hit the perfect momentwhere the right song comes on as you watch the sun slowly rise and peep through the treesand it all just feels… Right Hecktake my word for it when I say that having ACDC’s “Highway to Hell” blasting out your speakers as you’re racing down the road at max speed is something that’s hard to beat If you’re daringyou can even pop a video or TV show up in another window and zone out But just like real lifethe chances of you suddenly finding yourself wrapped round the nearest streetlight rapidly increase if you do this Stillit’s fun to try In the gamethat isand managing the two becomes a delicate balancing act of effective time managementwhere you are constantly checking out your route and seeing how far you can push yourself before you literally fall asleep at the wheel While it takes way too long if you’re not wishing to put yourself in a position of extreme bank debt so much so it actually gets a little frustratingyou can even make enough money to hire other truckers to your cause Suddenly you’re busy plotting out an empiretrucks roaming across all of Europeand your hard work being rewarded with a skyrocketing bank account You can even make the core game more complicatedif you’re that way inclined An automatic gearbox might be the obvious choicebut there’s nothing stopping you from having to switch through all the gears manuallyor even hooking a wheel up and going totally crazy The choiceas they sayis yoursthere’s a lot you can bolt on to the base experience Whether it be branding the sides of trucks with famous logosor subtly changing the map and the way your truck handlesthere’s a lot you can tinker about with if things are starting to feel a little dry Special shout out to the mod that lets you personalise the inside of your truck – because there’s something irresistible about decking out your cabin with a giant BB8 and a bunch of other nerdy bits and bobs that fill up every empty space While not offered in the game or mods themselves and I cant say I tried this myselfthere’s also means out there to take things onlinehitting the road with truckers all over the world Chances are you’ll end up in a traffic jam trying to get a ferry to somewherebut heywhatever floats your boatwhatever you choose to do and however seriously you take what’s on offerEuro Truck Simulator 2 is perhaps the definite chilled out experience with everything always just coming back down to you and the open road It’s the perfect game to unwind after a stressful daywhere the challenge or intensity of most other games simply doesnt appealand thats what makes it something so much more than something to laugh atWish I wrote this review years ago But being the hardcore gamer I amI decided to play the game instead XDWhy should I buy a truck gameIts neither exciting nor does it have any story but as it was on saleI decided to buy the game and see for myselfgot used to the physicsmade myself some nice money and built a trucking empire Then I found out there were modsI used to spend hours playing and listening to the internet radios in the gameI made so many friends to this day Im greatful that I played this gamePlease leave a commentlike it so people know that this game is worth buying all the dlcs for YesI bought every DLC they hadUpon a winters night quite cold“what a stupid game”Ill cross that linefaith was rockeddocked and dropped my charge” said my girlfriendI knew I couldnt stopPoland and LuxembourgMuch like my sentiments of Farming Simulator 2013I fell in love with Euro Truck Simulator 2 and I have no idea why Mundane job simulators are overwhelmingly garbagebut a select few including ETS2 are surprisingly compellingand are starting your own shipping company You have to drive according to the lawtake rest breaksbuy fuelpay for upkeep There is nothing on paper that should be exceptional about this gameyet for what it isEuro Truck Simulator 2 is disturbingly enjoyable I recommend everyone to give it a tryIt helps me cope with my depressionTopnotch truck driving simulator  With support for TrackIRwheels and pedalsthis game has become a gem of the simulation genreits hard to see why this game will be so addicting  I suspect much of that feeling comes from the progression from a lowly truck driver not even owning a truck to a multicountry Logistics company owning a hundred trucks and employing as many driversobeying the road rules rather than smashing things up like a madman  That saidif you disable the speedlimiter in options 90kph you can get a bit crazygetting as high as 10kph on some routesa bit of a thrill considering the cargo you have in tow  Speed cameras will become your enemy thoughprobably because the intersection was not programmed correctly  Dont get me started on the kamikaze AI at roundabouts eitherthis is the most fun you can have driving a truck in a game  Having a controller or steering wheel would be highly recommendedand if you have headtracking equipment its icing on the cakeMan Ill keep this shorta small onefrom Plymouth England to Rennes Franceat nightwith Died In Your Arms playing in the background you know this game is goodsimilar to those that enjoy that whale noise thingdrive form A to Bget paid You can run a trucker business as well Its relaxing as fk Not going to liefavourite it and youre setBee GeesDead or AliveErasureCulture ClubHuman LeaugePet Shop BoysKate Bush You know All the greats The list goes on Im only 21but fk I feel like Im 4 no offence to any 4 year oldsplaying Euro Truck 2 with a 80s station on at the age of 21after a long dayin the eveningfor a couple of hours every few nightsI said that when I saw itbut now look I fking love ith1What is Euro Truck Simulator 2h1basically you drive a truck and deliver trailers to your destinations across Europe This game is from the people of SCS who made other Truck Simulator gamesas referring to i18 Wheels Of Steel Series and Euro Truck SimulatoriI honestly thought when I first saw this game it seemed boring when I saw this I gave the first Euro Truck Simulator a try and loved it This game soul purpose is meant for people who want to kill the time thats worth it and love drivingyes it is It may seem like an easy task to dobut its actually a challengeyou gain skills and level up as you go You can use those skills to help you for traveling the longer distance and get higher payment as you complete the tasks Eventuallywhen you get that steady incomeyou can own your own truck and make even MORE money You start off with a small garageand youll be able to upgrade it and hire drivers as you go Even yettake the shortcut way taking out a loan You pick on what to doand noyou hit a vehicle youll just hit each other and no physical damage would be done between the collision If anythingyoull just get a fine Speaking of finesthere are laws you have to follow Such as speedingRed Lights and Green Lights and so on The weather system is alright to my standards as you can change the settings of how often you want it to make it rain as youre on the road Gas and time is a big factor too Its important to keep track when you need to complete your delivery and keep your Fuel up at times Sleep is also neededbut will get rid of that Simulation Feelisuch as custom trucksmap modsGraphic Mods and moreyou would have to try to find these mods somewhere off a ETS2 Mod Pagedefinitely I have the G29 Steering WheelPedalH Shifter includedits so much better and very more immersivecombining it with the Wheel is awesomeI would very recommend pairing it up if you have VR or want to invest into it if your PC meets the requirementsbut half of them to me arent worth getting Most of them are for Paintjobs for your trucks iEven though the Steam Workshop Supplies Free Paintjobs Without even Payingiand only explored 6732 of the map iThats because I took my timeand didnt rushiI had rare crashes that happen here and there and stuttering problemsbut thats likely my CPU bottlenecking my performance The AI traffic can be brutal at timesmaking sudden stops ahead of youor cutting you off simply But this is a rare occurrence Although take care as you put Mods into your gamesome mods will crash your game at timesbut thats often rare in that caseperformance has been flawless ever sincethis is a musthave I never had interest in trucks until I played this The scenery all around you while driving is justbreathtaking Enough where you just want to stop and admire the scenery around you Theres a wonderful DayNight Transitionweather effectsgoing 90kmh in the UK is just greatI highly recommend this gameeven if you have no desires about trucksEuro Truck Simulator 2  the smash hit no one saw coming Buy and customise your own fully licenced and detailed truck from any of the seven truck manufacturers ScaniaVolvoMercedesBenzMANDAFIveco and Renault then haul good around Europes cities Earn moneylevel upbuy garages and more trucks then hire workers to drive them Build a trucking empire whilst traveling across beautiful scenery with realisticlooking sunrisessunsetsfog and rain Works with keyboardmousegame controllers and steering wheelsnot to mention TrackIR and Oculus Rift With great mod support and regular DLCthis game remains fun and enjoyable almost three years after release Just buy itthen youll understandDriving around in virtual Europe while listening to the radio or a good podcast is a surprisingly enjoyable and relaxing experience An acquired tasteperhapsbut still a good gameThis is easily one of the best games Ive got in 2013and will probably remain in my Steam Favorites list for a long time I never played a game like this before and now it has me hooked It keeps getting betterthe gameplay of driving the truckstaking different jobsand leveling up my XP so I could make more money and buy my own truck Volvo FH16 Globetrotter Now Im working to upgrade my truck and my business The business part is pretty addictive too You can take a loanexpand your first garagestart buying more trucksand hire drivers to work for you Im anxious to get enough money to buy another garage somewhere else and start another fleetyou can do the same with your drivers or choose to have their skills autobalancedfor some reason driving in the UK made me a little nervousmaybe its the little extra traffic maybe its just driving on the other side of the road or maybe I was expecting The Stig to cross my pathand even though as a fan of racing games I at first had doubts about this gameI gotta say if you have a wheel you really should try this game Everything about the game is pure pleasurebut the driving is not just enjoyable but challenging as well Things like parking your trailer traveling swiftly but balancing your trailers loads around all kinds of bendsinclines and declines driving at night dealing with other drivers watch out for the evil empire of busses and trying to overtake slow pokes who follow the speed limit traveling as fast as you can and watching for speeding cameras and changing speed limits make this one of the best driving games Ive ever played Oh yeahdont blow those red lightsall the tickets you could get for various things can really ad up on one tripIm trying to make my trips even faster So Im balancing my loads at top speedstaking the ever changing curves of the road as gracefully as possibleputting the pedal to the metal but watching for speed cameras and changing speed limits watch out for those road hazard areas and be careful in townand trying to overtake just like in a racing gamebut its more challenging with opposing traffic on busy highwayswhich has a great interface and features but is very low resourceand I am looking forward to American Truck SimulatorTheres nothing better than sitting in traffic for 2 hours when commuting home during rush hourthen sitting in virtual traffic for another 2 hoursIts very hard to hype this game up You get into a truck with some cargo to deliver and hit the road accross a scaled down version of Europe Over time you gain experience for thingslike longer distancesmore valuable cargoetc You can eventually buy your own truckshire other drivers and expand your trucking empire and stuffits about driving heavysluggish trucks I am having difficulties putting into words iwhyi any of this is fun Perhaps fun isnt the right word at allsatisfyingand sometimes tenseit rained for a whileor got really dark Or both The moment where you missed your exit somewhere in belgium The moment where you discovered you could listen to actual internet radio from within your truckfrom a station that matches the country youre gently passing throughbut if youre anything like meyoull keep coming back to itrunning a delivery once in a whilebecause its relaxingand the moments are tantalizingtheres a multiplayer mod Its all of this except once in a while you will pass another guy going in the opposite direction Youll both cheerfully honk your horns in greetingthen continue on your respective ways I guess thats also another momentbut my deepest secret about it is that I am ireally looking forward to playing ETS2 when the consumer version landsi Seriously Thats how much I enjoy this gameI hate my Job ATM  So I come home and Im my own Boss  I own my Truck and TrailerI even employ some crazy looking geezer who barely makes a profitbut I respect him and treat him better than Im treated IRLbut this game is amazingI love it  Highly recommend you to at least try itI like the game as it isalthough one thing irritates meand that is the fact that you cannot buy usedolder trucks So it would be nice to see a secondhand shop where you could buy older and used trucks from like early 2000s or maybe even older onesThis would affect the price and condition so it could make driving less easyand by doing so it would add more content to the game Thus you wouldnt have to buy a brand new truck every time if you want it to be your ownI like to get an audio bookput it in the right folderand listen to it while Im trucking Makes the experience a whole lot more satisfying Id advise everyone to at least try the sameThis is the best Driving Simulator that i have come across The details are greatthe drivingironing out the little bugs that come upWe recently had our first child and I was looking for a relaxing game to play during my limited downtime Well I found it Cruising around Europesoaking in the scenery while listening to some random french jazz radio station playing in my truck literally puts a smile on my face Its also very effective as an excuse for more playing time Im just 2 km from finishing my tomato delivery to Venice is a lot harder to argue with than I just need to kill these last few guys
1,I meanwhats there to say Its Dark Soulsbut not as godawfully hard as the internet likes to proclaim it as if you diejust get back up try again Use your head Be smarter than them Youve got infinite lives Bosses dont have that Its just a matter of time till you beat em So keep your sword readypride in checkand head held high Its a long journey friendbut its not impossible Praise the sunthe tutorial is a boss fightIts like all those anime with overpowered protagonistsA week ago I was diagnosed with a terminal illnes and the doctors have given me a year at best Im so glad I was able to play again this masterpiece before I go I dont know how many people will see this but I recomend to you to buy this game if you do see it Gameplayboss fightsongslorepvp everything is masterfully crafted Thank you Hidetaka Miyazaki and FromSoftware for yours game I wish I can play Elden Ring before I goI summoned a mad phantom with the intention of dueling himbut instead he sat down and offered to toast with me We continued on throughout Undead Settlement together despite my wariness of him and he helped me take out all the mobs in the surrounding area After a whileI became accustomed to fighting alongside my newfound friend and started turning my back to him knowing full well that he would protect me to his lastdying breathand nothing could stand in our way He may not have been a Warrior of Sunlightbut Solaires legacy thrived on within him Jolly cooperation resumed until we neared the CurseRotted Greatwood  And it was then that I decided to take yet another chance and summon a second MoundMaker to see if we could rally him to our sideand his interest in my backside became a significant concern My anxiety was proven justified when the phantom took a swing at me with his greatsword and missedbefore charging forward with fury the likes of which none in Lothric had seen He made it his personal duty to end the traitorous life of the one who would dare attempt to strike at meand before long the violent fool was fleeing from our jolly wrath He rushed up a ladder and leaped across rooftops before finally dropping a harmful distance to the groundgiving us an opening to attack My companion launched himself from the rafters and his flowing cape waved majestically in the air as he readied his sword and plunged towards the infidel who would dare spit on the tenets of cooperation and sunlightthe weapon grinding through bone and flesh and rendering him a lifeless husk I dropped down following thisand we waved and spun our capes at one another in excitement and victorious gleeGreat game aheadTough but fair Rewards slow and methodical gameplay And the boss battles are fantasticElden Ring waiting lobbythis game wouldnt exist without Kentaro Miura Rest in peace senseiI was in a very dark place in my lifefull of depression and anxiety Then i downloaded and started playing Dark Souls 3  My life totally changed and Im in a much darker place nowAfter putting these many hoursI must say that this is one of the bestif not THE best RPG Periodyes It has a steep learning curvealso yes But this game is a rare gem among the simplifiedstraightforwardlinear games that are currently in trend Rare indeed for a game that actually rewards you for patience and restraint and encourages players to slow down and observe the surroundings and the enemiesthe same can be said about Dark Souls 1 and 2 But Dark Souls 3 is really much more refined than those in a good way Relatively faster paced combat not only feels more fresh but I think is a necessary step forward in making the gameplay more interesting Alsothe enemies are much more aggressive to compensate for this faster paced combatwhich I personally believe to be the best in the Souls series But it is still well above Dark Souls 2which I personally didnt like all that wellbut for brevity I must say Everyone must try this at least oncehardest thing so far was holding back the tears after realizing you bought the game one day before a 75 saleFinally beat the first bossseams like a pretty cool game so farThis game is so addictive that it makes you buy itself on another platformsGive us Demon Souls Remastered and Bloodborne PCBest dating simulator everThere isnt any game that will make me feel as connected to my character as much as the Soulsborne Series has But specificallyDark souls 13ive easily played this 34x more than the playtime suggests I also own it on PS4it might not be the best game the bosses not as hard as some but i made a character and that character i have never had a better representation of my self in any game and ill explain whyI remember putting the game on my PC and dealing with the buggy Microsoft Windows Platform but i kept goingI made my character look like me like i always do after the back tingling sensation the opening cut scene gave me The witches of izalith with thier chaotic flameGwyn smiting the dragonsNito moving with his wrathful stanceWith his Dark Soul Sharing it with others HumanityBuggy controls or not i had funNot just playing the game but reading desciptions of items trying to scrounge up what the lore ment and filling in the gaps that i missed I wanted more and morethe story was great even if it wasnt offered up straight to you and you had to look for itand i think thats probably why it was greatGrowing up he had a lot of time alone and he spent it readingHe loved it but his favorite books were those about the knight who goes on daring quests to save a princess or slay a dragon and find treasureHowever these books were in english and so he didnt understand them completelya lot of the information was missing and he filled in the blanks with his day dreams of how HE wanted the story to go imagining the hardships the knight must have gone through to get to where he wasand he couldnt have done it in a better way than what he did with dark soulsHe made a community of people who feverishly try to fill in the blanks of the story even so complex that it makes your head spinMaking it a continuation of my characters story its my favorite ending and if i have the option its the one i always take so to me the story of drangleic was someone else managed to get through and continue the age of fire while i went off and disappeared for an undisclosed amount of time with a dope hat and a ton of soulsspoilerthe controls were more optimized so the game itself didnt seem as hard and the opening cutscene was greati got goosebumps when the old firekeeper said And like a moth to the flame your wings will burn in anguishTime and Time again and that was very true to the game we kept going for more even though you would get that angry sensation to just put it down and not pick it up but you always doa perfect continuation of the story from the firstprobably due to Miyazaki having more influence on this game and not being distracted with a different project Bloodborne if i recall and it continued the story for me perfectlyfrom beginning to end Dark Souls 3 has made me feel like a bad assI always ALWAYS start Deprived recommend it to everyone even if youre just starting because i enjoy the feeling of starting from scratch and tearing my way through challenges to distract me from my challenges in lifei enjoy the struggle and Dark souls 3 Gave me a good fight but like every challenge its there to be completed and with the release of The Ringed City and Dark Souls 3  The Fire Fades  Edition the series will sadly be put to rest and to me it will go down in my history as the game that pulled me through depression because even though its hard when i felt like i couldnt accomplish anything in my life the Dark Souls franchise showed me that if i kept trying eventually i could pull throughI just finished collecting everything from The Ringed CityI killed Dark Eater Midir After a struggle and i gave the Blood of the Dark Soul to the Painting Girl She is naming the Painted world after me in this burning chapel of forlorn souls the final road in my journey through Dark souls I have slain Demons and Dragons and Men I Conquered Gods and Giants And ive arisen from the ashes to Usurp the flame a final time And now it all burns away The age of Fire might fade But the age of men begins in a cold dark and gentle placespoilerFor the DLC For the adventures and the times i spent jolly cooperating For helping me pull through For the Fantasy of Struggle Thank youi also editted it a bit so the Spoilers wouldnt be visible unless you hovered over them im sorry to the people who read them before i decided to use my brain and format it properlyspoilerStep 1 Buy Dark Souls III never having played a Dark Souls game beforeSome people saythat Midir is the hardest bossbut the naked guy who invaded and killed me 20 times in a row thinks otherwiseIt finally clicked Now I get why the Dark Souls series has such an activeenthusiasticand iborderlinei bobsessedb community Although I was hesitant to start bDark Souls 3bI can now say that it is one of the greatest gaming experiences I have hadyou often get disoriented as you progress especially during the first playthrough At a certain pointyou come across unlockable doors or elevators that connects to a previous area and acts as a shortcut The sudden realization that you went around in one big circle or that youre directly abovebelow a previous area always left me baffled I really wonder how much time was put into the level designIve barely skimmed the surface when it comes to combat but it is enough for me to recognize how incredible it is There are so many weaponsmovesetsspellsinfusionsand more Plus the combinations you can put together are only limited by your imagination for the most part There is a reason why several people spend hours putting together the perfect PVP charactersthere are itemsNPCsand interesting rooms hidden everywhere Its gotten so bad that I feel paranoid when I reach a pointless dead end and find nothing  “there HAS to be something here” Finding a secret felt like finding candy on a scavenger hunt and was thrilling from beginning to end Keep a look out for fake wallssuspicious ledgespotential jumpsand chests iBeware of mimics thoughiand to include a safe hub Firelink Shrinewhere most of the important NPCsvendors can be found This made Dark Souls 3 more userfriendly especially for beginners than Dark Souls 1 Although this made Dark Souls 3 more linnearI found the clarity of knowing more or less what to do and where to go also being able to teleport back in case you went the “wrong” way more enjoyable than the uncertainty I felt when playing the first Dark Soulsinterplayer interactions play a large role in the Dark Souls series You can leave notes to either help or trick othersyou can summon other players for a coop experienceand you can invade other peoples worlds for PVP I think this is another reason why the Dark Souls community holds strong  despite being portrayed as a single player gameyou are rarely alone I found that the online features coop and PVP worked very well most of the time Naturallythere are some instances of lag or disconnectionbut it is very easy to set up again Initially I hated being invadedbut Ive learned to love it for two reasonsvictories are so damn sweetI knowbut it adds nearinfinite extra hours of excitement and replayability to Dark Souls 3I still find that Dark Souls 3 is not very beginner friendly More specificallyI had to look up some basic guides before starting the game to understand which stats do whatand what sort of build I should go for A lot of informationfor example stat softcapsis not particularly clear to begin with I find that this steep learning curvein addition to Dark Souls notoriety for being difficultpushes a lot of beginners away On the other handthe Dark Souls series has come a long way3 being the most userfriendly and clear game in my experience After playing itI realized that I could have easily learned how to build my character through a little trial and error Grantedmy character would not be perfectbut like many veterans say “no point in Vigor is wasted” Dark Souls is the kind of game that expects you to pour countless hours in to before you “git gud”such that a veteran with awful equipment will almost always beat a beginner with Godtier equipment It should be emphasized that bYOU ARE EXPECTED TO MAKE MISTAKESb the complexity of Dark Souls 3 is exactly what makes it so spectacularbut it has quickly become one of the greatest gaming experiences Ive ever had If you are on the fenceI urge you to give Dark Souls 3 a try Be patientlearn from your mistakesand dont give up  only then will you prosper and praise the sunI honestly believe that the deathlearnfromyourmistakes system is the number one selling point of the whole series

when we will have implants real lifethe entire world will be buggy and glitchy This game is just immersiveiand i would sayi am very happy i didnt give up on itas far as bugs goits pretty stable and i didnt really encounter anything that was majorpeople are different so this is purely my opinionbut i dont like how the car driving feels in this gameit feels too stiff and unnaturalit might be just me because i am used to oldschool car drivinglets say GTA 3NFS anything before NFS 5  Porscheits what i use most of the timesthe waypointing system is somewhat badthe routes you get arent the most efficient onesand often your objective isnt appearing on the floor it really isso you end up searching for something and then realize it might be in some hidden basement or somethingor maybe i am just getting oldbut i feel like theres no point in overcomplicating thingsbut its fine by methe game compensates with other stuffand this probably was my biggest oof about the game was that the assault rifles are pretty awfulbut the assault rifles are just bad and inefficient Even shotguns are decenttheyre the pillar of this gamethe ultimate moneyshotyou will feel so smallIts quite an interesting feeling that i could never get from any game beforefor me this thing made the game so much more immersiveamazing world details and suchbut the size of it alltooalleysnot to mention if you go climbing like a goat on all the buildingsif youre into walking simulatorsthis alone could be worth your eddies ie moneyit avoids some of the most boring clichesalthoughits not anything mindblowingdepending on how you make your decisionsi think its pretty rare to actually feel like your decisions really affect people in games To feel like youre actually influence someone realcmonthis dude is a decent fellai shouldnt be a dick to himand welli usually dont overthink that kind of stuff in a gamelolthe internet is full of tutorials and contentthey arent very finicky to installhoweverupdates usually tend to mess with thembut also random events happening around as you walksuch as groups of gang members commiting dumb stuff Obviously you can go past thembut would you After this game will suck you inyou wont be able to stop sinking hours in itmy advice would be to not rush into the story I kinda did and i am not very happy about itand enjoy some of these side stuff firstbesides leveling up and getting cool stuff which will aid you in the main missions laterits also the best way to get to know the gamesome subtlesome not so subtleespecially if youre from Eastern Europenonlethal and stealthyor you can go in guns blazingand not leave one single cell in an enemys body alive Of coursea combination between all of these options is also a possibilitybut i like to keep it simplei can and do appreciate a game with good stealth CP277 doesnt have a good nor bad stealthits just averagei guessi mean purely by how it feels for me to play it in stealth You do get to be very creative in stealthyou have interesting ways to mess with the enemies and distract thembut the satisfaction just isnt there for meits a game that will suck you inyou will have fun for hoursthe world is purely amazingyoull feel like Woah all the timei was angry about the delaysbefore i got the chance to play it at the releasemy PC died Now after 1 year i finally get to play it I know its better that i didnt play it at launchbut its about the principleand for the price i paid one night out in the city spoilerI might have an alcohol problem thoughspoileri had and still have a lot of funeven if i already saw 2 endingsi am not letting my grip of iti dont even remember when i was so caught in a game that i played it without a break until the sun was risingand theres still plenty of juice in this babybut theyre people and they make mistakesand they werent lazy I would say things went wrong because of the team leadingresource managementbut thats another subject and quite irrelevantand they fixed a majority of issuesand they still are working on the gamebut it is what it isi cant say i am not disappointed because its not how i expected the game to be after how it was marketed prereleasebut i also like to believe i have some common sense and ability to make the best out of situationsfor Vigilantismfor Vanityfor spoilerVirilityspoiler It stands for anything your heart VVantsbiEveryone complained about the bugs and glitches but the real problems are that the games systems are terribly outdated People were promised a nextgen experience Ive played games from a decade ago that have better open worlds then thistheyll just stop and sit there for eternityor sit and enjoy a virtual drink unless its a talkingscene tied to a questNomadCorpo have little to no affect beyond the first 2 minutes of the game and simple dialogue changesshapeor formliveriesor bodypiecesshootingrangeboxingand car racing There are only two shootingrange questsonly 6 boxing matchesand only 4 races Thats it as far as minigames goI cant recommend this game to anyoneh1DOWNLOAD THE NVIDIA GAME READY DRIVERS FOR THE LOVE OF GODh1update your nvidia driverswhile I have not finished it I feel I have experienced enough of the core mechanics to formulate an accurate opinion at least on the gameplayconsidering that Witcher 3 was amazing and I still have yet to get through it entirely it does translate Narratively this game excelsthe dialogue is well written and acted and the characters are hard to not fall in love with Walking around the world is exhilarating although unengagingit is lacking interactivity That being said the gameplay itself is a lot of fun The guns pack a huge punchvery satisfying to use The melee with katanas specifically is fun but brokenI did a body and reflex melee build and was able to behead TONS of foes before they even had time to react The game is unfortunately plagued with bugsless severe bugs especially after the recent hotfix but there are a myriad of small immersion raping bugs that pop up here and there Bethesda stylethe graphics are important but less so The decisionmaking of Witcher is here and thats really what I like the most HOWEVER this game was clearly not ready and considering recent events with the dev I will be hard pressed to trust them again This is an incredibly bad launchif youre the type that is a fan of Deus ExDishonoredor Fallout New Vegas you will love this game warts and all just for the godlike quest design those and this game offer Plenty of skill check dialogue to be found Suffice to say that I have had a good amount of That actually worked moments so far which is a really hard feeling to nail down with games like thisyou usually only get that out of CRPGs like Age of Decadence or Divinityetc At the same time I do not judge anyone that refunds this game or waits for a more stable version to come out because CD PROJEKT RED really dropped the ball and should not have released the game in this statethis game is mostly what I expected it to be and it is a shame that people expected this game to be the second coming of Jesus I was banking on the decision making and quest design and this game delivers on those fronts Everything else thoughit does fail here and there butin my opinionnot enough to make the game genuinely bad If I had to give it a score out of ten it would be a solid 81 Hopefully CD PROJEKT RED can iron out all of these problems in a timely manner and elevate its standingit depends on what youre driving but in my opinion it should just be the same for whatever youre driving but Im just talking out of my ass at this pointAlthough its buggy and feels poorly optimizedI still sunk 4 hours into the game just doing side missions without even trying The game has its issues surebut the game itself certainly is something special worth at the bare minimum open mindedness that CDPR will address the issues in a timely manneras they did for The Witcher 3 on release as well Remember Roach the roof horseSo I am over 6 years old and fairly new to gaming in general Jumping from World of Warships fairly new at that also to this gives you an idea Before this it had been many years since playing ANY games SoI am floored by this game To me its amazing Now I set the combat at an easy level and I bumble around in here and am in no hurry I explore around sometimes doing nothing but looking around I have gone through a fair amount of the story line  again  its all amazing to me In short I love it I now am branching to more gamesas I find I enjoy playing more then one game at a time I love the characters of this gamethe visuals of itand have no complaints Occasionally I run across a very minor glitch of getting stuck or somethingbut this does not bother me I do not expect perfection But I want to emphasize this is very rare Well done to the developers of this gameif you have an RTX card turn on DLSS helps out performance a lot I love this game but games needs to be optimized and fix glitchesh1 Great game but it needs polishingh1for everyone who are still willing to buy it I will definitely advise to wait a bit Trust meI am not the one who scares everyone awayon the contrarythe ugame is greatu and worth buying it uBUTu everyone who knows the situation will agree that uit needs polishingu Its sadthat thanks to some peopledevelopers had to publish this game earlier I wouldnt be offended if they took more timelike VALVE did with Halflife Alyxh1Just rememberh1Spoiler freeive done a 1 corpo playthrough on very hard as well as a melee run on normal sprinting thru to obtain the secret endingmultiple friends and I have had majorly different outcomes playing the same class in the same stylebuild as well as found tertiary outcomes in subsequent playthroughs Cant stress how good this aspect is enoughthe side content is easily double if not triple that Between cyberpsychosgigspoliceside kick story questsflavor text quests it can actually be quite overwhelming when you begin the game For the full experience I highly recommend completing all of the sidekick story quests as they give the opportunity to experience the most endings as well as inject the most girth into the primary story Easily the highlight of the game This is obvious when comparing my two playthroughsin the 1 one I had a complete feeling of understanding the directions things were going were carried by these side questsall of the motivations and history are there In my rushed playthroughit simply felt like a series of conversations with johnny silverhand and taking turns swapping bodies completely different experiences I just felt like I was rushing around doing errands for johnny by pushing only the main storydespite the crowd AI not being amazing Yesdespite there not being 1k routines YesI played RDR2 and GTAV and yada yada yada Night City is alive and you can hear it breathing This is amplified 1x when you acquire the double jump or rocket jump legs The verticality they promised was delivered in spades EVERYTHING is climbable Give it a shot Look aroundits the same song and dance Massive amounts of useless scaled loot where everywhere you look you see slight 1 dps upgrades to already existing items Add onto that you have a weightstash system and it just becomes a chore by the end game If you are a packrat like meinvest into the body perk for 6 extra carrying capacity for peace of mind The exception to this con are the iconic weapons that are unlocked after completing certain criteria Unique and usefulI found skippy to be the best weapon in the entire game Look out for him and the other icons rushed Sad One of my most anticipated featuresmelee is in a rough spot Dont take this to mean that melee is more difficultit simply means that the AI is so bad that they clump up and spin in circles or glitch through walls to 1 shot you with a shotgun and you will end up getting gangbanged every time Cop AI ismissing If you commit a crime and get 4 stars just let them kill you or drive away far enoughthey will simply give up There are no correction routines for driving AI Simply park your car on the road to create an infinite traffic jamNo crash reactions No crash animations You can hit a wall at 2 mph and be fine They make no attempts to course correct or avoid collisionsame with the crowd AI If you double jump in public people will justhuddle near youscared for their life AgainAI feels missingbased on the gender you chose at the beginning of the game So if you went in with ideas of who you wanted to fuckyou may be very dissapointed if you care at allthis is one of the most enjoyable RPGs ive played in my life The amount of variables you have to play with in the beautiful world of night city is actually crazy When I read reviewers saying that they hated johnny silverhand because he was an asshole or that they didnt really understand the story and that it all felt rushedI feel bad Or I read on reddit that the game was too buggy to enjoy and there were too many droppedcut features to be a good gameI feel bad We played different games I got an 81 hour open world RPG set in a cyberpunk universe with characters that had personalitya story that had me wondering about the possibilities so much that I immediately started a second playthrough A city that was handcrafted top to bottom with views so nice I was constantly snapshotting and posting them on discord A soundtrack that had me wanting to sit in cars to finish tracks I got a game that I am disappointed having finishedChoomNO SPOILERSI have been holding off reviewing it for a whilenor the deceitful behavior from CDPR throughout the development and release Just the game itselfthe gameplay and  the mechanicsI was never part of any hype train and only paid attention to what CDPR specifically said the game would bewhy that “header” bthe point still persistbut they still got it wrongand not like this”“It would have been better if…”“It would have made a lot more sense if”what’s good about this game bit IS visually very impressive It looks amazing Stunningthe look of the citythe open world in generalthe loremost of the storythe battlegun systemthe great side quests that often more than rivals a lot of what the main story have to offerthe perk system and the ability to equip Cyberwareand mostly subjective of coursethe game has been cut to piecesheavily watered down from the original visionmarketingday and night cyclesthe metroweather impacting the gameimportant life path selection it doesn’t matter at allcrowd community systemthird person cutscenesthe AI etc etcbut instead it is groundbreakingly badno interactionsno heartno factions you can play into for depthno nothingthey were supposed to feel alive and part of the gameno real wanted system You see them from time to time on street cornersalmost Tposingthey just always annoy you if you aim your gun in public or hit a pedestrian etc and they then almost always WILL become aggro to you If you did the deed on the top of a mountaina cop probably saw it somehowthey ignore you beforeduring and after the factthey only just recently patched that cops would spawn right behind you no matter where you were at the time in the weeds or on top of a buildingfeels very unreal as I’ve been saying There is a lot to dobut it has absolutely NO effect on anything at all It doesn’t impact youthe game or the AI“Crimes” etc are just random no effect happenings  plus lootagainst the virtual world in which you are imprisoned And with that I mean that it feels like you are in a virtual world  in gameby any means Just really disappointingis that it’s finite It’s closed off Either you finish the gameor you don’tand it shows if you look at how fast people stop playing it on Steam alonebuilding my characterdoing side queststie up loose ends  until new content came out Becauseyou knowit’s supposed to be a next gen open world RPGwhat’s up with the GTA thing bAIcity stuffinteractionsreactionsphysics and mechanics And then making them even better for this genand that CDPR wants to take Cyberpunk Online at some pointI actually enjoyed playing I mean I have 1 hours in it Rightit’s complicatedimproved on etc so the gameplay would be better I wanted to save the main story for that SoI spent my time hunting lootgrinding etcthe main story can still endcredits and allwithout it forcing you to stop playing or only being able to go back to before the endbut you will feel hollow and regretful latergameplay mechanics etc will probably not see any action before a good while if everim a clown for pre ordering thisEveryone is focusing on the code bugs and graphical glitchesand there are so many of those for every platform  But even if we strip away all those technical issuesthis game is just plain incompletebut actually loses you your knife after a single throwwhich totally destroys any point to having such a perkstrategy  In the endit makes every battle feel pretty much the samedespite intense attempt to build a character that goes counter to itbut is that what perks should be doing in a game  Fix the chore itselfinstead of making it a reward to not have to do it  Interestinglythere are paradoxes to getting rid of this tediumsince scrapping certain junk actually removes economic opportunities for the player too some junk is worth way more than the scrap it createstheyre just pretty environment geometry  Most of the game is like thisdespite such a beautiful citythere really isnt much to do in the city besides travel through it and shoot things  No sportsno bar gamesnothingwhich is both unrealistic and cheap  But even thenon Very Hardyou can easily escape any wanted level by sprinting down the road in a straight line  The cops cant keep up and they wont put any backup in front of you  Alsojumping in any body of water will confuse the police enough to lose all levels  For a game that came out seven years after GTA V and thirteen years after GTA SAthis is comically unacceptable  I hate when people blame QA for game issuesbut the AI honestly makes me wonder if CDPR even tried playing this game naturallyor perhaps if their warnings about the gameplay were ignored altogetherbut thats about the only compliment I can give this game and it just further exposes the fact that the city is pretty void of things to do  And when looking at all the tall buildings seemingly connected by a network of high rise tunnels and bridgesit only serves as a tease since the game has no real vertical element  No flyingno climbingno parachuting or repellingits just not good  It has a lot of sizzlebut no steak  I love the setting of this gameand I love The Witcherand I loved the way this company operated in general  I had expected this game to revolutionize the open world RPGbut instead we got a mess so badI cant even understand how it got released with a straight face even putting code bugs aside   It doesnt justify the 6 purchase price for meand it doesnt hold a candle to many open world games that came out ten to fifteen years ago  This may not be the worst game in historybut its easily the most disappointing game Ive ever played  I hope CDPR gets its act togetherbecause this game is not goodI have been thinking of writing a review for this game for a long time I love Cyberpunk 277I still play it and will continue to play it as new content comes outbut as of writing this review June 17th221v122 I cannot recommend it as a whole experience with clear conscience I will update the review once something changesbut they did not address the issues I mentionI love the gameand I do love it for a lot of thingsbut the most important one is ipotentiali The game has potential to be greatone of the greatest games in the genrebut its not fulfilling it at the moment For nowI see it as a skeleton of a game that it can bebut the core elements that are there are very strong These elements are the main story and side storylinesworld building and auxiliary storytellingcharacterssettingthe aesthetic and visual designgameplaymusic both inradio and ambient soundtrackthe list could go onsure enough they arent goodbut 1 I believe the game has much bigger problemsand 2 I believe those will get ironed out with timewith each new updateand that term encompasses a large area of the gameso Im going to point some of them out and what I think would be a better alternativethe character creator is quite expansivebut customization extends to more things than just Vs physical appearance We are talking gunscars and bikesapartmentshaircuts and tattooscyberwareetcthey have no purposeno routinesjust occupying screen space They spawn and despawn as you turn aroundturn around and start walking in opposite direction when theres something in their wayreact unrealistically to traffic or gunfire Traffic NPC AI is even worsethey wont go around any obstacleno matter how slightsometimes just plain stop in the middle of the road for no reasonswerve around lanesnot react properly to traffic lightsit goes onbut there should be people you can talk to that arent part of a quest in some wayand these corporations produce things Mostly arms And if you look around the cityyou can see they have their branded stores I think that it would be great for immersion if these stores were functional and stocked with weaponry manufactured by that corporation for example corp A produces power rifles and body armorcorp B has flamethrowerslight machine gunsand grenade launcherscorp C specializes in bladeshas all the katanaskukrisknivesaxesetc and you need to visit a specific manufacturers store to pick up a specific weapon type You should be able to customize your gun when purchasinglike changing the skin and getting attachments And on the counter side of the corpo stores would be street markets where you can buy preowned ironmaybe it already has a scope on itor some paint and stickers Its probably not as a good as a brand new toybut at least its not sold at a 3 markupalongside the price and street cred requirement It was implied that different implants have different humanity coststhe greater the modificationthe greater the cost for examplea lowkey Kiroshi eyeball implant would have a significantly lower humanity cost than a Maelstromlike visor replacing half of your facebut would also not offer as much utility We dont know how having high and low humanity cost would affect the gamebut I pictured it to be a nuanced and interesting systemits that they barely change your appearance The only mods that change your look are arms and hands mods We should be given a lot more options of heavy body modificationsyou just open the shopping windowbuy the implant and youre good to go There should be an animation every time you get an implant installedsimilar to the first scene at Viksthe corporate stores dont make that much sense here like they do with the guns Since ripperdocs are running their independent clinicsthey can stock with whatever they want or whatever they can get There should be topoftheline clinics with bestbrandnew implantsand scroungier chopshops where maybe its a bit more mixandmatch like a cyber arm put together from different parts but itll get the job donethere was a lot of teasing going on One of the teasers were snaps of Night City fashion and the 4 main dressing styles prevalent in the citywhich indicated that your choice of clothes is important in the city of dreams Meanwhileclothing selection is pretty limitedand clothes serve simply as armor I would have much rather have armor stat be boosted only by either wearing actual body armor or by installing implants like subdermal armor and shock absorbersand have clothing be purely cosmeticbarsrestaurants and food standsracesfistfightsBDsside questsgigsand hustles Action 1 of the time There need to be activities to do in down time You should be able to go to a bargrab a seat and have a drinkgo to a club and dance the night awayvisit a restaurant and have a nice meal at a table or go to food stand to grab a bite on the go Its the little things that add up to a greater whole When playing for the first timeI remember reading all the websites on the Netand being impressed with how complex the city isand wondering which of the coveted clubs Ill visit first when I get the chancemostly inconsequentialdialogue options throughout the gameas well as the life path intro part should be longer to really get a feel for what life was like for V before becoming a mercenary at least a few missions Alsothere should be more gigs with Jackie before we do the Heistto bond with the character moreonce the thread is over you can barely interact with your SOmaybe youll get some texts from thembut thats about it There should be something more you can do with them after youve done their questsbecause it doesnt feel like theres anything to discover  the city is reminiscent of its citizenslooks goodbut is empty on the insideas of right nowevery event in the game world is prescriptedmy review of Cyberpunk 277 Like I saidI was thinking about it for a while so theres a good chance Im forgetting something else I wanted to mentionI said all I had to say so you can judge for yourselfbut if I were youId wait for the first drop of new content before decidingI bought this game on sale for 7 AUDand I had bought in to any hype or watched any trailers I watched a couple reviewsand bought this at a sale price to see what the fuss was aboutbut I wont be playing it again Please let me explain why I still recommend thiscorpo infested city that is alive with things to do The montage of you and Jackie plays out in hot spots around Night Citydancingdrinkinghaving a sick time You fly in an AVyou take on the biggest Corporation in night city with the hopes of becoming legendsget drunk and stumble aroundfuck around with the Privatisedcorrupt NCPD more on that laterwatch brain dancesgo to clubs and danceits just a map that exists for you to drive throughthey dont respond to anything Patch 122123 The traffic is still useless and have no mind of their own I parked my car on the road and it just caused a massive line up of cars just sitting there waitingwhen I can just steal a car to do that for me Or just fast traveladvertised as corruptnasty power abusing thugs do NOTHING And if you do run into themthey will spawn IN FRONT OF YOU and blast you to pieces Theres no bribingno arrestsno dirty cops asking you to do jobs for them They dont even drive around Its a SERIOUSLY missed opportunity considering the amount of NPCD side gigs you can doget a warranta cop tries to arrest you You could either pay your way out or do a job for him This could be linked to any of the NPCD gigs in the city But theyre not The cops do not play a massive part in the world and its seriously best if you ignore them completely Because they always ignore you When they dont ignore youits a broken mess that is pointless and adds nothing to the gameplayand youre right But this game sets the expectation that Night City is your playgroundand its a city that is alive and can be lived in Its not Its just a map to do shit inbut for others the beauty of the cyberpunk city may be enough to keep them interested HoweverI really doubt itfirearmshackingand stealth I found myself using stealth and quick hacks a lotand relying heavily of Tech weapons to do serious damage to peoplebreaking peoples necksdumping the bodieshacking security cameras and turrets to work in your favour were some of the best times in combatthe AI were either super smart or super dumb dumband once I found a Power Rifle all encounters were so damn easy it was a cakewalk from then on out I played on the hard difficulty for referenceand the combat for me was overall acceptablebut you dont see your character enough anyway so dont worry too much about itnamely the clothingall look fuckin absurd By the end of the game you will be wearing so much mismatched nonsense for the sake of armour and clothing modsREALLY stupidall of it is for saving your life No one wants to help you unless you can do something for them Kill some other gang membersteal some shitkill some other dude Find out that the person you did all this for cant help youor they just die anyway Your character becomes desperate and by the end of the main story youre either making a deal with a corpo devilor going out in a blaze of gloryand Ill explain belowhe seems pretty reasonableand you go to investigate a break in of their homeantennas and cables leading to the roofand then you spot a van outside the buildingyou end up a huge firefight Once you waste themyou hack the van and find out that these group of hackers are literally changing Peralezs mindhis personalitythey are changing him completely so when he gets elected mayor his decisions will favour these hackers intentions A crazydystopian nightmare of mind altering controlElizabeth was aware of it She had no choice but to go on with itto not tell him what was going onto either explain to him to situation or give him no cluesyou are contacted by the hackers They blacken your visionand warn you to stay out of itthe rebellious anti corpo blaze of glory bad ass warns you to stay out of this one Its too risky I wanted to find these guys These hackers who are controlling a politicians brainsome crazy cyberpunk shit that made my skin crawlyou receive a few text messagesand thats it Mission over You never hear from them againso damn close to being a fantastic missionbut they all just scrape the surface of something with the potential to be MUCH biggerbut it never happensIm disappointed that this was ALL it had to offerthe lack of world developmentThe main missions that end SUPER quicklyor the side missions that burn out right before they get really goodglittered in a cyberpunk aestheticBest Early Access game ever cant wait for the final buildEDIT Completed the game after 65 hoursnot nearly as packed as Witcher 3 but every minute just as enjoyable The main quest gave me the point of no return pretty quicklyso I avoided that and completed just about everything else on offer firstaside from boxingcollectablesout of the way gigsand police shootoutswhich felt like filler Most of the main content is very well done and found only a few instances of mediumstrength bugs that lessened the experience Some of it is nearly brilliantso I cant tell if some of the anger over this game came from broken promisesbut this is exactly the game I hoped it would be and it exceeded my expectations Played on a modest system at lower settings to keep a decent framerate and the graphics are incredibleworld is amazingcity is layered and complexand detail shows in every dark corner It doesnt have the interactivity of a GTA title you cant take your fake girlfriend bowling or get a haircutbut I never cared for that stuff anyway The mission designsettingand writing matter to meand Cyberpunk delivers through nearly the whole running timeand that it gets fixed up quickly for anyone unable to give this a try I can easily see that the game isnt for everyone but you if you ever liked a Deus Ex then give this a shotwhich are medium Even with these low settings the graphic quality is really good and keeps framerate ranges in 56with a few drops in some outdoors sections This is very playable No crashes or gamebreaking glitches for me so farthough there have been oddities that required a game restartand hits exactly what I was hoping for The shooting is well above averagecar handling not so good hopefully these get some changesRPG systems seem plenty deep enoughand the conversation trees are mostly great Dont feel like Im far enough in yet to judge 
1,I held off on reviewing until I got much further into the game since most other reviewers only have a few hours I had 50 hours in beta but the game has changed a lot sincetruly a massive game Can expect 00 hours of content on a single playthroughmoreso than any other cRPG You can spend hours here because of how many options you haveso if character creation  build crafting is your thing then youll get your moneys worthwhile an Aeon will rewrite historyetcso similar to DnD 35 Turnbased and realtime are both options depending on preference and you can finetune difficulty settings as neededso the writers had a great foundation to build off of The writing thankfully never feels longwinded like many fantasy RPGs tend to do and I genuinely enjoyed talking to NPCs and getting to know the companions I also appreciate that you can mouse over keywords in dialogue if you want background info on a topicsome felt a little forced overactingso if you jump in and this applies to you then make sure you go through character creation and see if you can load into the intro cutscenes There is currently  gamebreaking bug in Act 3 so half way through the game related to the Crusade mechanic that Owlcat is aware of  Otherwise the game is stable with minor bugs that should be fixed quicklybut you may run into a quirk here and there particularly with the turnbased combatthat works tooKingmaker was the darkhorse of the recent cRPG crop It came out of relatively nowhere and impressed with its scope and soul Rough around the edgesbut an absolute diamond of a game Having played thatit would be a massive understatement to say I was excited to see what Owlcat would do next In factI was totally hyped I followed the development of their next Pathfinder gamethis time based on the Wrath of the Righteous adventure modulewith undiminished interest throughout Now it is here Time to see if it meets my extraordinarily high expectationsthe setup For a century the demons of the Worldwound have plagued the kingdom of Mendev and all Golarion A mighty portal that allows the denizens of the Abyss free access to the Material Plane remains open there The mortal races have tried repeatedly to push the demons out of their world and shut down their gateway Four great crusades they have fought and four times they have failed Nowled by the Demon Lord Deskarithe abyssal hordes are stirring againlaying waste to the great citadel of Kanabres This time though something has changed A new champion has appearedgifted with great power the hero takes charge of the crumbling crusader forces and leads a counterattack The fifth crusade is about to begin The powers that be are beginning to move again and Areelu Vorleshthe infamous architect of the Worldwoundis watching from the shadowsthe combat generally engagingthe experience endearingly familiar Baldurs Gate veterans will feel right at home from the get go Instead of showering the game with more contrived praise though I will be focusing on what did change and there are several alterations Some fairly significant The problem is many of them left me with mixed feelings I will discuss in more detail some of thosenamely the expanded classesraces and the inclusion of mythic levelsthe effect this has on difficultythe army management mode which replaces the old kingdom management mode and finally the shift in tone of the story and characterizationshowever beautifuldid not appear to be as clearly designed as it could have been The many abilities offering similar skills made it needlessly obtuse Feats that act as other featsspells you can waste spell picks on when you would get them thanks to some class feature anyway and of course bugs Because complexity always leads to bugs Wrath expands on the number of classes and races In principle thats a good thing But it does little to actually streamline this already fairly overwhelmed system It doesnt quite push it over the edgebut gets it that much closer to the brinkthey form an additional leveling system and provide extraordinary powers A very interesting ideathat burdens with more complexity a system at its limit The result is rather messy In particular features like additional bloodlines or domains are very poorly handled An overhaul of this system is quite necessary Mythic levels also have a story component They offer players a series of paths they can followto narratively transform into a mythical being Such as an angela demon or a lich In principlea welcome feature But not all mythic paths are built equal The evil ones in particular dont seem very fleshed out Furthermorethere are advanced mythic paths which you can only switch to near the end of the game Those simply dont have enough screentime to matterbut the power bloat in Wrath is exasperated further by mythic levels Owlcat again follows the flawed approach of inflating enemy stats to increase difficulty Enemies with unreasonably high armor classes and saves are pretty much the norm But that doesnt really make the game properly harderit simply restricts the player and promotes more specific exploits Add the mythic abilities that some bosses in particular get and combat can quickly get very frustrating Combat is a big part of the game and having to repeatedly reload in hopes of getting better rolls is hardly ideal Thankfully the game does offer a highly modular difficulty systemI just wish the defaults were better balancedWrath combines classic party based adventuring with a more strategic aspect In Kingmaker that was kingdom managementhere it is Crusade management This mode combines a greatly simplified version of the old kingdom management with a new army management system The army part is a simplified take on the Heroes of Might and Magic formula You guide your armies on the overmap and fight enemy armies in a small gridbased battlefield It is no accident I used the word simplified twice Kingdom management in Kingmaker was already not very fleshed outbut it worked and was interesting Rather than expanding it so it could realise its potentialOwlcat cut the number of buildings and synergies and diminished the importance of towns Army management simply fails to make up for that loss This modethough not badultimately feels unfocused and spread thinhere we have irredeemably evil companions Here you cant always force a happy ending The world is bleaker Howeverthere is an important problem with that The game kinda sucks at being evil Im going to ignore the laughably bad omnicidal reactions the game sometimes offers Just ugh Even in more nuanced situations thoughthe game underdelivers The plot feels like it was written expecting you to play the good guy A lot of things simply work better when you are on the side of the angels A lot of evil options seem like afterthoughts in comparison No matter whatyou are the hero that will drive out the demons anyway That betrays a lack of coherent direction Thankfullyevil companions have more depth Showcasing the writers can do evil well when they want to One of the brightest examples perhaps is Camellias romanceit really shines on an evil routethere is lots of unforced errors The addition of map rotation for instance Great featureuntil you realize that in a certain city later onits used to determines what the map will look like Cue in confusion and bewilderment Alsothe various puzzles present Nice additionsI love a good puzzle They are interesting and difficult Thats good They are also obtuse and intrusive Thats bad Im all for solving a clearly defined hard puzzleguesswork is less fun Puzzles that block my progress Even less Then we have bugs Kingmaker had launched in a sorry state and I really hoped Owlcat would have learnt their lesson They didnt Granted the game is consistently being patched and I have no doubt it will end up in good shape So why not go early access for a few months insteadWrath had lots of ideas to tweak the recipe and great potentialbut Owlcat somehow managed to consistently be their own worst enemysabotaging their effort to improve on their previous game The end result is a step back from Kingmaker Of course a step back from one of the great cRPGs of our timeeven two or three steps backis still in the realm of pretty damn good Despite the shortcomingsI enjoyed this game After it is properly patched I intend to replay it again Do I recommend it To cRPG fansyes Lets keep in mind there arent many people out there doing what Owlcat doesThis game is easily one of the best games I have played this year It is a huge step up from Kingmaker and shows that Owlcat is really trying to broaden its horizons in terms of mechanics And my recommendation is that you dont touch this game for at least 6 monthsa year at mostbut for the love of God dont play it for a while Owlcat has dropped the ball with its QA department yet again and combine that with some bad decisions during the beta has led to some unfortunate issues with the 4th and 5th act of the game Mystic paths are clearly not working as intended since testers didnt have access to these final actswriting and balance take a drastic nosedive from start to finish by act and bugs can range from slightly annoying to game breaking I dont think the game needs more time to be developedlike a Cyberpunkmore that the game clearly needed proper beta testing for the final actsto give proper criticism for what clearly has flaws Bugs arent even my biggest complaintit’s the clear balance issues that exist in the game right now in the later sections If you arent minmaxing your party to an insane degreeyou will be forced to turn down the difficulty as fights progressively get more and more untenable It is insane that anyone thought it was a good idea to have mob enemies with 80 AC on a core difficultyand thats not even getting into the base stat inflation of enemiesand ludicrous amounts of attacks per turn that most enemies will have by the end of the game When the last two bossesthat have been hyped up for most of the gamearent nearly as hard as one of the mob trash in the last actyou have clearly made a mistake somewhere along the waythose previously mentioned innovative mechanics are somewhat broken as of this moment and will actively hinder your experience if you try them The crusade mechanics dont work properly a decent part of the timewith some event cards and decrees being stuck on my list since act 3stat bonuses are sometimes incorrectsometimes straight up game breaking It’s not just buggybut a slog from a gameplay perspective If you arent extremely lucky and manage to hire a mage general out the gateyou will be in for a rough timeas troops will have to fight enemies for hundreds of turns due to a weird balance as of this moment You could just enable autocrusade if you really want to skip itbut somehow in doing so you will skip some of the more interesting paths in the gamethat are still very buggy mind youas the game relies on certain events to happen within the crusade for mythic path events to fire Even the rewards you get from these crusadesancient relics that have either been protected by the godsor corrupted beyond redemption that might help you out in your battlesare brokensince sometimes the game just kind of forgets to give them to you or to give you the option to actually use thembut not enough to necessarily hinder your experience that muchand what’s there up to act 5 is very goodthe story is interesting and the worlds reactivity to your decisions is astounding And then act 5 happens Act 5 somehow manages to destroy a decent part of the build up to the games climaxand act 5 is where most of the bugs I encountered managed to show up on mass The NPCs stop feeling as reactive as before aswithout spoiling itcritical events occur in a brief periodyet it seems like nobody really cares Characters stop feeling like characters and become objects in the world spaceand its honestly so disappointing to see a great build up to such a massive let down I can only hope that they might see the complaints that have arisen with the final act and do some big story patch that adds in dialogue to examine more closely what happens in act 5 and give these characters they have been introducing a better send off in its closingbut I wont hold my breaththere is clearly a fantastic CRPGbeyond all these issues The story is interesting and takes some pretty big changes from the tabletop module that I think are for the best and depending on your mythic path the story could go in a vastly different direction from another The companions are way more interestingat least to mecompared to Kingmakerwith a lot more reactivity to the events around themchiming in more frequently and putting their personality in the fore front Theres a lot of side details as well that impressed mereactivity to race selection that Im certain wasnt in Kingmakeralong with dialogue specifically for those following certain deitiesmaking your choice of faith matter far more than just being a minor stat improvementmaking your selections in the character creator count significantly The voice acting is also very impressivethroughout the entire gameit is very clear that the VAs are giving it their bestfrom Anevia to Deskari everyone sounds greatand it really helps to flesh out the NPCsand it is a crying shame that it really doesnt lead to much in act 5 destroys a part of that personality to NPCsand having finished the game I would say it was worth itbut being a good game at a fundamental level doesnt excuse a vast amount of bugs that litter the gamebalance issues that plague the late gameand what feels like an unfinished 5th act There will come a day when many of the bugs have been patched out and we have Wrath of the Righteous Enhanced Edition Plusbut the core issues with act 5 will always be thereand I would keep that in mind should you decide to play the game I can only hope that Owlcat sees the community feedback and takes the necessary changesbut if the response to the beta is any indicationwhat we have here is what we getI think this is my favorite cRPG ThereI said ityesmost of them technical I reported no less than two dozen bugs through the ingame Alt  B report system I also think its fair to say that the incredible ambition of this project went a bit beyond Owlcats capabilities as a studio HoweverI appreciate what theyve done I respect the audacity to go a bit beyondinstead of being completely safe and thus doing nothing new They got enough of it rightmore than enough reallyfor this to have been an incredible experiencei was very doubtfull about the next Pathfinder crpgthe issue was rather the added in citybuilding mechanic and the heavy dependancy on time gated events or time limitsenviroments and even item 3D models have been done with quite some attention to detailed and the lightingengine does wonders to breath live in a topdown world what is especialy remarkable are all the little animations your characters got their unqiue idleanimations a monk npc doing some katasa palading prayingetc to enviromental animations like water in one of the first dungeonsto random clutter beeing animatedbut most important dialogue isso are spellcastconfirmations and shouts during combataswell as very well done ingame cutscene which reminds me even more of the good ol Infinite Engine times was voice acting is there is toplevel ive yet to find an actor that makes my ears bleedwhich is already greatspell effectsetc are on pointbut got improved pretty much every detail during gameplay can be referencedso that even newcomers to Pathinder can get an overview of statisticslore and most important enemy resistancesimmunitieswhile still beeing visualy appealing there are stats over statsfeats and skillsclassessub classes even some realy outthere ones and sub races and and andtheres a metric ton of optional side contentheck even optional minibossesmore potential partymembers that you will be able to recrute in your 6 slot partybut from the very beginning the plot is presentgoals are clearly communicatedwhich might be partly due to how the plot is structuredIcewind Dale and co where once the pinnacle of crpgsBeen stuck in character creation for 2 hours  so many choices that I chose to go to bed insteadBe warnedthe game couldve been in development for another 6 months just for bugfixing Some are gamebreaking and some are blocking progressloremusic and general atmosphere are amazingHaving finished the gamethe short version is amazingly complexepic RPG when it comes to character building This could be one of the best games of this type out therebut it has problems Some of these will be related to it being made by a still small company in a comparatively short periodothers with the desire to remain true to the pnpwhich imo doesnt always translate that wellbut the azata path is perfect for misfits as its all about inclusivenessfreedom and cuteness really As silly as this soundsI was so fond of my character by the end of the gameits hard for me to envisage trying another playthrough The complexity the mythic paths offer and the number of class choices there are along with how this changes the story are really mindblowing I also really liked to liked most of the companions The two I wasnt too keen on have the pros that in one case you only need to take her along three times and the other one sticks around even if you end up not helping her Alsounless you build a character that can pass a lot of skill checks themselvesyou will likely end up with a stable partyas switching out characters can leave you crippled as regards skill checks otherwise All in allthis is a massively ambitious game which imo has been pretty well implementedesp considering the restraints mentioned above and the scope of the audience that needs to be catered tobuggy gamesI highly recommend waiting to playboringbadly implemented and dreadfully explained Dealing with it as well as questing and the crusade management aspect involves hella micromanagementtedious loading screens and   as I discovered too lateday skipping In my caseId slogged through the map with a subpar army so I could quest in peaceonly to find myself amassing vast amounts of now useless troops that were much better than the ones Id used and both the morale and the conquest banner flipping to yellow In other wordsif you want to max all your crusade statsyou will probably want to leave some forts to be conquered and spend some time in between questing and fighting armies in crusade modejust hanging around in your headquarters skipping days to move stuff along Also dont be afraid to wait until you can recruit a lot of decent units unless you want to reload some battles a lot of timessometimes aggroing the next fight To spice it up even morethe game starts lagging horrendously at this pointfor instance Theres a super useful item you get early on that the game deactivates constantlymeaning you have to check literally every time you do anything  restpass a loading screenwhatever I could go onbut it would be boring Turnbased mode is also inherently buggy atm Thats not to say the games unplayable   if I managed it most reasonably capable gamers should and the difficulty sliders use them mean you can tune it to your preference I really didnt feel very special at the end of the game due to the way the difficulty increases faster than your power does at this point in the gamein particular lawful evilis just uptight kill  imprison everyone who doesnt do as toldwhereas good is some kind of super naive forgive everyone no matter what atrocities they have committed and even if they dont even pretend they regret anything an attitude thats also held by one of the companions I expect its least irritating if you play some kind of neutralas then you wont feel like you ought to be picking the good or evil options even when you think they are ridiculous Having said thatI kept my chaotic good alignment pretty much dead centre in spite of frequently not picking the good or chaotic options  its just better to pick the option with no alignment descriptor most of the time if you dont want to end up changing it Howeverthere are scrolls of atonement allowing you to get your alignment backor you can respec your character which allows you to pick alignment again and resets it BUT its bugged atmslow movement on the mapmechanics that are there to basically force you to spend more time moving around the map slowly and ploughing through loading screens Missing 9 times out of 0 even with a level 20 myth 9 party on nerfed normalrngbased checks that can be circumvented by reloadspamming During restingcompanions talk which is the only probut this imo is much better in Dragon Agewhere your party talks while you walk around and even build up relationships with one another so without forcing you to sit there staring at an ugly resting interfacebut in short flawed masterpiece which will get a lot better with bug fixing and other improvementsbut itll stay micromanagement and loading screen intenseas well as laggy and probably difficultyspikish and hence a slog in parts Oh and the puzzles are terrible Ohand finallygetting the ideal playthrough andor the secret ending will require either a lot of playthroughs and and epic memorynote taking effort or extensive metagamingThis game made me feel like Im back in my childhoodplaying Baldurs Gate 2which made a big impression on me and developed my love of RPGs as well as DD pen and paper included I was under the erroneous impression Pathfinder was but a different variation of DDeven iffor all intents and purposesto meit still remains as suchamazing experience so farabout 4 hours in and I feel like Im barely scratching the surfacewhich gives plenty of tutorials for the newer player to explain some of the basics and tipsyet still offers a lot to someone knowledgeable about the mechanics and tactics Having said thisI do have to berate the game for giving me the impression my exploiter wizard a class I had never heard of before required INT and CHAnot the usual INT and DEX As it turns outhaving little DEX does affect your ability for all kinds of touch attacksmaking your character rather ahem useless in most cases Who wouldve thought the mechanics are all therethere are PLENTY of classes and even more spellsabilitiesitems and enemies Combat is fun and feels satisfyingespecially when your tactics go right and exploit the enemys weakness or reduce their advantages The actual animations might not be quite as polished assayDivinity Original Sin 2 or Baldurs Gate 3but thats a minor complaintthe characters themselves a lot of funbringing intrigue and a wish to learn more about them There is voice actingwhich is pretty darn good most of the timealthough not all of the text of which there is a lot is voiced Prepare to readsometimes they will define your character or decide what companion you might gain or lose So farIve felt like my choices actually mattered and werent simply superficialwhich is saying a lot these daysbut theyre at the very beginningbut they seem to be bringing some seriously epic changes to your character spoilerfancy turning into a demon A dragon A lichspoilerespecially epic onesand this game delivers on a scale I havent heard of in a while Veryvery enjoyablehere is a videoedit edit edit one last update Beat the game The last two acts felt SUPER rushed writing and timing wisethe enemyboss difficulty is all sorts of wacky way too easy and way too hardinconsistent andetc etc Overall Im not too dissatisfied because I love the genre  the number of people extolling their love for the genreand thus willingness to suffer bugsshould tell you a loteverI guess They sleep standing upflying around Why does that not work Its a mindaffecting ability that makes them lie down of their own volition Are they physically unable to be proneeverno matter what Theres a crossbow that pushes enemies back Sounds neat Well it triggers AOOs on YOUR units when the enemy is pushed away from them That sure makes sensehuh Also you lose your full attack if the enemy is pushed back on the first shoteven if there are other enemies in range Also the knockback is supposed to be 5ft but its unlimited until they hit an obstacle This is the FIRST heavy crossbow in the game thats magicuntested and broke Owlcat must have an ungodly long list of ridiculously straightforward bugs to fix becausefranklymany of these are so obviously shortsighted oversights and niche situations but its these precise situations that youre supposed to seek out in this sort of game with so many options When it doesnt work at all how its supposed to it becomes frustrating and sillywhich I felt far too often during my playthroughNPCs allegedly trained to fight demons and they do nothing but spam frost cantrips against demons with 0 cold resist They will literally never deal damage Their crusader training consisted of spam spells that will never hurt the demons I guess No wonder theyre having a hard time dealing with the worldwound How utterly stupid And its this sort of thing that rears up over and over again and every time it reminds you that its a hot mess and totally wrecks immersionthough Is just how much is brokenOver and over Feats that dont workitems that are brokeneffects that do the wrong damage amountsenemies that ignore effects you manage to land on themetc etc First act stuffearly gamebroken 00 Untested Weakening Wound to lower DR Doesnt workat allperiod No effect Cool Love wasting featsIm sad to say Act 6climatic moments and its just a hot mess NPCs you have grown to know through the game valiantly rush in to join your cause  and die in one hit Or better yetstand behind your party and spam AE Greater Shouts that stun and damage your entire partymaking the fights WAY HARDER for absolutely no reason I would prefer they not be there at allits just horrid design that they have no concern for friendly fire whatsoever A bunch of quests are broken and cant be completed One in particular involved literal hours of puzzlingonly for the last partthe get a rewardto be broke Neat The Trickster is just a drunken jackoff that is more Youtube pranks and LOLRANDOM than anything clever or tricky at allIm super disappointed in how it was writtenbut thats at least a matter of personal taste Ive continued to find item after item that simply doesnt work whatsoever I wish I could love everything this game is but it needs so much bug fixing still to be a remotely smooth experience Characters you retrain get basically totally broken my mercenary hasnt had toggleable abilities that work for several actsAct 4and sadly my feelings stand Overallbroad strokes  I love it But do I recommend it as is Not quiteunless youre WAY into the genre So many bugs Tons of magic items that just do not work at all Frequent issues with getting physicallypermanently stuck especially in act 4  neat ideamechanicwonky implementation The aforementioned NPC companion is just gone foreverso I just lost out on that from a bug With some patches this will probably be a stellar example of the genre  but thats an IFnot a do you recommend it right nowas isso no it is ThanksSteamI love the game because of what it should be and what its based on As it ishoweverthe bugginess is kindve maddening Its one thing to have a random  bonus not stack right or not applysure finetheres a lot of complexity going onbut its a whole nother thing torezdhealedor otherwise recovered Neatfor examplehas no vampiric toggle It just isnt thereto not get the right number of attacksto lose your turn randomly when you use a swift action and not get to make a movestandardetcsuffer against DRetcthis doesnt even touch on balance issues  full BAB characters need 20s to hit in half the fights Meanwhile foes get 46 attackshit on a 2and oneround your heaviest of tanks  only mirror image can save you unless you do the cheesy stacking monk tank or some other hacky build 80 of the enemies are immune lightning and have 2030SR0 firecoldacid resistetcyour casters will be sad You can turn the difficulty down to a degreebut I feel like normal difficulty shouldnt mean you have a 5 chance to hit oh just use touch spells for high AC Oh you mean the ones they get opportunity attacks againstSR againstand arent available for many circlesdamage typesand casters Great plan The tragedy is that rather than become difficult and strategic it becomes reload until you sleeptripetcthen wail with AOOs Thats bad design Maybe if youre running a full munchkin party its finebut if youre not its just sillystat losslevel drain is FAR too rampant in the early game when you have no way to deal with it Have a character that can cast restoration Well they wont do it when resting in the safety of town you have to put them in your partygo somewherecast itthen walk back to town and swap your party back around Tedious and sillyI can and will endure it because this genre is my absolute favorite If its not your absolute favorite you should probably wait a while So much of this is imminently fixable and obviously buggedits not even obscure or subtle Much of it has been reported already in betathoughand some of it is as basic as class doesnt get ability button at level Xwhich is like The most basic of QA you could do for each class Nevermind if it works or notyou dont even get a button to try to use ityou can probably deal with the bugs If you dontjust wait and hope they fix a lot of whats wrongbecause there is a LOT of bugginess that just isnt excusable It gets worse and worse the further you get  at present a playable and mostlypolished act  becomes a slightly funky act 2 becomes a hot mess of act 3 becomes a slog of act 4etc Funinteresting combatalthough poorly integrated into the narrative and dialoguereally lets you go wildbig battlesand convosfun charactersinconsistent writing with shallow exploration of its ideasbut they are too campy about it so it ends up seeming like cartoony ultrahigh fantasy Compare Diablo 3 to Diablo   the latter had a much more maturesinister take on hell and demonswhile the former made them seem like zany cartoon villainscacklingmockingbadmovie evil Lots of Muahaha to be heard with little in the way of believable motivations  and not just from the demonswho might be excused if the writing explored the nature of being a demon better But theres no complexityThat monster seems so monsteryyoud usually have no idea because theyre so poorly thought through The choices are often something like Youll never win Good vs Well defeat youdemon Evil Strong emphasis on the mechanic of shifting alignment over the content of whats being saiddone Just pick the options that youre supposed to pick for your builds alignment and mythic path Strong emphasis in this game of MECHANICS over story or roleplayingeven though you would never have decided to do that Paradoxicallyyou often feel like you have no agency Example You run at the demon What NoI would never do thatthere are few roleplaying opportunities The range of personalities represented in the dialogue is too narrow and the thought behind them too shallowcombat is really funI recommend to fans of crunchymechanical RPGsbut not to fans of story games This is a dungeoncrawler It has amazing build diversity Awesome fights Great builds Immaturechildish writingand some of the corniest implementation of choice  consequence Ive ever seenalthough the choices are significant Expect a bubblegumpop fantasy story that is highflying and grandbut ultimately just shallow escapismOne of the best isometric RPGs I have ever played A huge improvement over Kingmaker in nearly every aspectbe it in character creation and customizationor in dialogue options that push the story forwardoverlapping and branching based on your actionsa good middle ground between serious and tongueincheekso that it perfectly emulates the feel of playing DD

1,Good lordthis is a game that makes me excited about what games are becomingit just looks like prettier Factorio But it has defined itself by emphasizing gameplay elements which Factorio marginalized in order to do what Factorio is super good at logistics Factorio was defined by elaborate resource chains feeding intricately into complicated recipeswrapped in a giant logistical metagamebut the game has taken the emphasis off laying belts and later railroads and put it on exploring the map on foot while fighting packs of monsters in action sequences clearly inspired by the best ARPGs Fighting the monsters is insanely satisfying in a way I havent experienced since a bone sliver build playing Diablo III Its so smooth and satisfying Youre scouting for resource patchesbut also there are sites where you can get a lump of resourcesmods for your weaponsor find bosses which unlock unique research options Slaying enough monsters of a given type also unlocks research options and it feels weirdly but satisfyingly like level upsand suddenly youre playing Dungeon Defenders in front of a wall out of They Are Billions Ive played 40 days on Hard and these packs are getting monstrous I see the blob on radar and gowat You fall back to your turrets and praythe campaign is similar to the overworld of Anno 2205 or a set of Terraria world saves You ultimately get the option to teleport between a bunch of maps with different biomesbuilding bases on all of them and contributing to your shared pool while picking and choosing questsor its dumbed down or some nonsense because the emphasis Factorio placed on base logisticsRiftbreaker moved to arcadeesque ARPG goodness and tower defense Those people think they need to prove something LookI love to play Zachtronics games like the other nerds but the day I say no to beer and Mario Kart I need somebody to shoot me because Im already dead inside Riftbreaker absolutely stands on its own by virtue of the only criteria that truly mattersA great combination of tower defensefactoriosupreme commander 2and MOBAYou want Factorio with more aliens and less automationIve been waiting for this game for a long time and so far the expectations were meetwith familyjobother hobbiesetc our time to play is almost nonexistentand with the litle time that we can spare to play it seems that most games arent that fun anymorethose games may be buggyclunkywith outaded graphicsetc but oh boyhow fun it is to play themUPDATE I beat the campaign on Normal after 33 hours Wow This was so much more than expectedbut so is upgrading your character Theres also a MASSIVE set of tech treesbut I definitely found that I had my favoritesbut bare bones Thats not necessarily a bad thing thoughand some pretty rough frame chugging when things got busy toward the end max settings on a 2080ti 1440p 144fps No crashes though Just a couple little quirks here and thereI highly recommend this game if you like city builderstower defenseandor RPG gamesbut wowwondering how deep theyll be Thenits 6AM and you should have gone to bed many hours ago No crashesno need to look anything up yet It just feels great to playbut I really just wanna get back to playing the gameADD MULTIPLAYER PLEASEOpens Riftbreaker suddenly realize  hours has passedA great game made by people who actually thought and care about the user experienceupgradingresearching and because of this when you expand your base its not a pain in a and feels more like progress Good mix of tower defensefactorioand supreme commander Good performance too when blastin down the alien hordes Voice acting doesnt really grab mebut didnt buy the game for it anywaysThis game is like if factoriostarcraft and a tower defence game had a kida very smart kid who is also a big scifi nerd and respects your timevery well maderuns well on most computers and overall fun no need to worry about item conveyors and super mega optimized efficiencya nice break from the culture of making you need to be a masterclass german engineer man to just play a base management gameIf youve watched Avatar and thought the guys with mechs and bullets shouldve wonthen this game is for youAlien shooter  checkImagine if this masterpiece had a multiplayer or coopFactorio  Tower Defence  Crazy fun gameThis game shouldnt be legal because its so freaking fun Easy GOTY 2021 Its combines the best things about a lot of game genres like hack n slashtop down shootersautomationtowerhorde defense and the mechanics are very straightforward so you can get right into the action This is really a dream come true because its like taking Factoriomaking automation simpler and moving the main focus to combatchanging the graphics so it looks like a triple A 2021 game and mixing all that with the hero missions of Starcraft 2 and that episode of LoveDeath  Robots with the big mechs vs alienssuch a good combothey are using their own engine that looks insane and performs smooth like butter It supports RTX and other techs The particlesgorephysics everything is eye candyeven destroying vegetation is fun afa stupidly high amount of weaponsturretsenemies and resourcesbiomes that really feel different with many environmental hazards and unique handicapsvery polished campaign with many hours of content and awesome features like procedural maps where you can establish a network of bases The list doesnt end and it will also get coop in the futureits so cheap for the quality it offers Indie games are just the bestA surprisingly well polished game with lots of fun and outstanding visuals It is no exaggeration to say this game is one of the best tower defense games Ive played throughout this year If you are someone who like basebuilding and tower defense genresand also love to destroy beautiful nature of an alien planetwelljust buy it with no hesitation상당한 즐거움으로 무장한 매우 완성도 높은 작품 과장 하나 안 보태고 말해서개인적으로 올해 통틀어 플레이 한 타워디펜스류 게임 중에서 단연코 최고라고 생각할 정도 공장 시뮬레이션과 타워 디펜스 장르를 좋아하고외계 행성의 아름다운 자연 생태계를 무자비하게 파괴하고 싶은 욕망에 사로잡힌 인간이라면 주저없이 구매하시길I was excited to hear about this gameand now that its out I havent been disappointed which is increasingly rare these days with all the endless early alphas and buggyreleasesRiftbreaker is a lighter than most automation gamesbut it also has a solid combat system thats fun and satisfying to play  There are games with better actiongames with better tower defenseand games with better basebuildingautomation  But Riftbreaker manages to straddle all these genres beautifullytaking some core gameplay from each while ignoring the parts that would drag down the hybrid approachthe error box helpfully suggested I could disable raytracing in the options menu  The game looked eversoslightly not as goodbut also jumped up a few dozen fps from 60 to solid 100 and stopped crashing completely  I know some of the recent patches were intended to address the crashes I hadbut I havent bothered to flip the settings back on to check and seebut I rarely have the time and attention to actually play them properly  Riftbreaker turned out to be exactly the right balance for me to really enjoy  A lot of the qualityoflife features like ammo getting put where it needs to beresources being shifted around the mapsetc are all automatic and default  I didnt have to play 20 hours of the game before my ammo production would be brought to meonce I plunked down an ammo factory your weapons will be reloaded over time while you explore and fightRiftbreakers base building is so painless compared to most automation games  Since theres no conveyor systems to worry about except for liquid resourcesyou dont find yourself punished whensome countless hours into the game you research a new type of factory that requires a different arrangement to use  This meant that iI could just play the gameresearch as I wentand never hit a point where I unlocked something new and had to spend the next several hours rebuilding large chunks of my infrastructurei  I didnt need to already know what the tech tree was going to give me later on before doing my base layout  This has killed my interest in more than one basebuildingautomation gameso I was really happy that I never hit that wall in Riftbreakerall in all i give it a 810I have finished the game’s campaign mode Here is my thought so far I absolutely love the idea and concept of this game It is however lacking two major elements in my opinionsand it seems that it is going to take them about 6 to 12 months It makes me feels like that I have something I really really want to share and enjoy with my friendsbut I cloud not I have to wait for a year or half I can’t promise that it will still have my attentions after that much time This game would sell much more with coop on launch I myself would buy few extra copies just so that my friends could join mebut what I want is infinite survival not a few hour quick rush I want to play this game in a Factorio kind of waybut I am not fully satisfied I would say that this game is overpriced without coop and endless mode at 2This game deserves a positive reviewas its mindblowingly innovativewith fun gameplay elementsamazing graphicsdeep progressionif you like anything related in the genre and this is a mix of tower defense  rts gameswith some hack and slash and rpg progressiontry the free demothe demo itselfand a prologue one Probably the sameidkbut it shows how confident they have been with their game Im gonna play this for hundreds of hours during yearshoping the content keeps growing Devs seem to be greatbtw
1,After my main characterEmperor Illiya of Italya drunken fornicator and hereticwas assassinated while attending a ceremonyI switched to his grandsonEmperor Astore of Italywho took to the throne at the age of 25 Astore was born of two white parentsyet suspiciously looked to be of partial African descent Despite looking nothing like his fatherhe still managed the Empire much better than his predecessor His sisterAgostinawho also looked to be halfblackruled the neighboring Empire of Francia Because the realm split when Iliya diedthey both had a strong claim on their respective empiresthey both considered each other great friends And the comfort of this friendship helped Astore greatly after his firstborn son was mysteriously murdered As an emperorhe was known to be extremely generous and kind He helped put down many rebellions caused by his grandfatherand restored much of the land which had previously been lost By the time Astore was 75 years oldhe had lived a long and content lifehoweverwhen an extremely old man offered to give Astore a secret in exchange for a favor Expecting the secret to be some mundane thingsuch as some man from India having slept with one of his courtiersAstore reluctantly accepted the offer Howeverthe secret was nothing less than the true murderer of Astores son Agostinahis only sisterbest friendand faithful allyAstore declared war on the 8 year old Agostinashattering the alliance The war waged for 4 years until she was eventually captured and executedand earns this games acclaimComing into CK3 as a longtime CK2 and EUIV playerI was slightly concerned about the content and playability of CK3 After allCK2 in its initial stage was very limitedand it was through the course of very many DLCs that fleshed out CK2 to what it is today CK3being brand newand rightfully with no expansionsfelt like it would be in danger of being a pale imitation of its predecessornow with over 4 hours in CK3I can safely say this game lives up to everything that CK2 brought to the field and more The UI is muchmuch more intuitive and new playerfriendly Furthermorecontent that was added over a long period of time through expansionsDLCs like India and Tibet are in the game right off the bat and immediately playable There are also many newwelcome mechanicsat least for people like me who like to roleplay their dynastic legacies or jump ship so as to speak Let me explainI decided to go with an old favouritethe Magyars Leading the fore as AlmosI led the Magyars to migrate into the Carpathian Basinsnatching it from Bulgaria Following thisI attempted to conquer enough lands to reform the Taltoist faithbut combined pressure from the Carolingian Kingdoms and the Byzantine Empire led to the death of Almos and poured cold water over my dreams of reformed Taltoism As Almoss sonArpadI turned Catholicand used holy war as an excuse to conquer all my heathen neighbours despite being pagan just years ago With Hungary formed and its borders secureArpad finally passes on As the 3rdgeneration King SzonukI noticed Bavaria was no longer in the hands of the Karlingsthereby breaking their tripartite alliance I bide my timebuilding

England and Scandinavia as well As I look at the sea of Arpadys covering the mapI vaguely realize Ive recreated the Western and Eastern Roman EmpiresA lot of things have been streamlined for the betterit seems A decent amount of content from CK2 DLC was put into this base game but not all of it I like how they were integrated so they didnt feel as bolted on Thanks for reading my reviewfriendThis is game is great Why Because it will bring out the absolute worst in youI promisenoble and just ruler God knows I triedbut it aint easywho is likely to loose mostguess what happensall the while plotting to kill you something had to changelying and vengeful place Being niceis not gonna cut it Youll learn that quicklyfuckedblackmailed and murdered my way to powerit did uieverythingiu to keep itkind of the norm reallybe so kind to have your own go at it bCheckbto setup the child for a longer rulebCheckb  and kinda smartsanctified Emperor over most of the known world My Dynasty rules the rest And there is peaceafter trying for years to get into PDX gamesbuying expansion packs i never played with the knowledge that i would LOVE these games if i could just figure them outcrusader kings III came along and kicked me down the rabbit hole with its intuitive user interfaceextremely helpful tooltipsand actually functional tutorial now i cant get enoughIn the year 931my sister and lover was murdered by my friend and brotherinlaw He burnt her at the stake with my babe in her belly He was a powerful manmy sister married wellhis family spread far across Europe with many of his kin in the most influential houses of the developed worldstarting with my niece and nephews By the time I was donehis family was erased from historylost to obscurity and time All my focus and hatred had left my own family nothing more than a poor Dukeso heavily consumed by a hate he didnt understand that by the time it was all over he took his own life before he fathered an heir ThusI lost my own family to obscurity and timeI would get it rightnoble and strong The world will tremble as 35 years of tyrannical darkness descends unto themThey actually made it good Imperator had me worriedbut its actually fucking good Paradox finally did itIts a natural evolution to and a significant enhancement of Crusader Kings 2in pretty much every waysecrets and scheming system is simply outstanding and adds so many layers to the interactionsespecially with friends in multiplayerdoctrineswith faiths having interlocking interactions is the most complex implementation of religion in a Paradox game and allows for some truly unique playstyles some things are not very realistic at game startbut theyll improve with patchesthe technology system is so incredibly improved over Crusader Kings 2that it might be my favorite new feature in this game The way it interacts with realm lawswarfareeconomyand with cultural  regional ideasmakes learning a viable path to specialize your family in through the midgameA great release by Paradox standardsand feels complete and polished from day one The improved graphics add a ton to the immersionand the new mechanics add needed depth to gameplay systems The writing is improved over CK2 and there seems to be way more eventsboth small and largeand everything is absurd as ever Combat systems were redone and play much better in this game The UI also feels much cleaner Its as complex as it always has beenbut thats what makes it great This game is an improvement in pretty much every wayand I am not at all disappointed A worthy heirit will only get better with timetry CK2 for free first If you like CK2this is an easy buyLook up at the clock Ten hours have passed That kind of gamei had a bastard son but didnt tell him he was my son but raised him as my son then married him off to a girl then seduced the girl and cucked my son then had a bastard son with my sons girl and didnt reveal he was my son so my son thinks my son is his son but really my sons son is my son 11My son has slept with his mother who got pregnant and then both decided to create a faction against me including a successful rebellion which costs me half of my territory Good gameIm about 2 hours into this gameso I wanted to drop a quick First ImpressionCK3 is a more of a hybrid wargamemanagement system  Like many of the CIV gamesyou have opportunities to build and improve provinces and you can certainly raise military forces I think strictly landbased naval seems to be abstracted or nonexistent so farand I estimate that liberally  All of these things are tightly wrapped up in a decisionbased management system that produces causes and effects with some of the effects being farreachingso he accuses you of having an incestuous relationship  You decide to Deny it  He gets even madder  One of your courtiers hears a rumor that the clergyman is plotting to kill your daughter  So you secretly arrange for him to be murdered  The neighboring Lord finds out through spies that youre responsibleso he blackmails you  Even though you pay him offhis cousinthe Lord in the OTHER neighboring county decides youre weak and decides to lay claim to YOUR title armies marchwars get foughtetcthis gets THAT complicated  And the levels of all of these interactions get very deep and very complicatedlike a spider webIm loving it although to be frankthe new hasnt quite worn off yet  The biggest advice I can give anyone thinking about buying CK3 is what I said up front  Make Sure You Know What Youre buyingyoull be disappointed  If you buy it only looking for an empire builder like CIVyoull be disappointedI sucked at CK2This game is easier to learn than CK2 They practically hold your hand while you are playing Learning curve is not as steep as CK2 or EU4 Very Enjoyable experience Recommend for sure I have enjoyed these games for 1s of hours and will continue to do so and hopefully teach my son when hes olderShould you get this game Read my struggle2x larger army than the islamic caliphate and a ruler with 28 diplomacy 37 intelligence and 5 prestigeand 5 prestige croaked at a healthy 79 years of age11 combat skill17 stewardship1 intrigue16 intelligence  62 prestigedeclared their own liberty warmy initial treasury of 2 43 a month ducats pre war was reduced to 4 ducats 51 a month couldnt get worse rightand in the hindustani culture in this gameyoure not able to grant titltes give away providence lands to your sons and daughtersthe culture ditcates that you must share your land with your brothers and sisters no matter what unless you try and murder themgod tier papa with the 5 presitge and 37 intelligence died and had nearly 9 kids that had to each inherit one of my titleswhich resulted in the heir my next character getting the capital when papa died the capital was the hotspot of the buboinic plague so literally every single one of my sonsdaughtersbrotherssisters fking died either on the battlefield or due to the bubonic plague outbreak in my capital my only county of residenceall my children and siblings died except for one soul surviving heir my grandson who got the beubonic plague but recovered after finding myself a physician and plunging my tresury deeper into the hole at 1 but sure fking enoughhe died about a few minutes after I recieved the notification that the beubonic outbreak has ceased to exist in my empirethis game is something else this is easily one of the best modern paradox games that theyve produced apart from all other paradox gamesthere is no late game superority where youre so strong that nothing can defeat you or destroy you the game does not get easier just because you are the world super power regarding tech advantagesprestigetreasury ectyou simply have much more microing to do to ensure your longevity and your spot on the top in this gameironicallythe bigger and stronger you becomethe more vunerable you becomeI covered up my daughter murdering my son because her stats were great and I wanted her as my heirthis game is amazing for itI started off as Jarl Danny of Aarhus  an intriguing and manipulative manthat used and abused all his subjects to get ahead in lifewhile keeping it all a secret When he finally died his son Danny Dannysonbecame a marvelous tradesman and steward who gained enough land to finally create The Kingdom of Denmark After spending his life spreading the influence of Denmark and gaining immense wealthhe would retire to his bed a die a succesful manwho it turned out was a complete psychopath As every subject of the kingdom realised thisthey started riots in the streetsmeanwhile every neighboring ruler started mobilising forces and declared war on my landspreading my forces thin and eventually capturing FreyiaFirst Queen of Denmark and executed her by way of Blood Eaglethus being left with no moneyno land and no heirs I had become but a speck of dustlost to historyand now having nothing to show for it apart from this taleI can wholeheartedly recommend this gameToday in Crusader Kings 3I murdered a man with a poisonous spider to widow his wife and end the marriagebased military alliance that had been blocking my endlessbloodthirsty pursuit of ultimate power over a united Ireland and so far my review is lot of combat and insanely complicated mechanics getting in the way of this marriage simulatorFirst a word of praise for CK2which was by far the most unique strategy game Ive ever played Nothing else comes close to the intricate blend of strategyRPand feudal shenanigans But its unique nature unfortunately concealed some major issues By the end of its runthe game was seriously weighed down by a clunky interfacespammy eventsand all kinds of unintuitive legacy systemsmore coherent and interrelated eventsand mechanics that lean into the RP aspects have all given the series a new sense of vitality If Paradox releases worthy expansions that deepen and expand some of the RP aspects and government mechanicsthen this has the potentialin my opinionto be the best strategy game of all time Highly recommendedA huge improvement over CK2 in almost every way Even the incest got upgraded Im glad it didnt end up being an Imperator Rome 2 and Im loving it so far Cant wait to play Elder Kings mod on this one

0,Im Chinese and I played these games since the early 2sthey were never technically great even back thenIve always treated them as more like visual novelsinteractive moviesthat kind of thing Only later I realized these are basically Chinese Final Fantasy since foreign console games were not accessible in China back thenyou shouldnt expect AAA quality hereits more of an indi gamewhich I think is fair for the half price its askingbut smaller in budget even compared to older FF games like 13 Animations look stifftheres no interactivity with the environmentRPGcombat elements are pretty generic The game runs oknot great but since its UE4 it cant be too bad either Currently the issue with performance I believe has to do with asset fetchingwhenever theres a big change in camera angle the game stuttersand Im running 2 97PRO NVME in RAIDI can only imagine running this game from an HDD would be a nightmarewith RTX on very high you even get RT caustics in the ponds which is quite impressivedont think Ive seen this in any other gamealthough this is obviously just a dropin effect they could enable in any UE game I mean its a pleasant visual novel to sit throughjust dont expect Horizon Zero Dawn or Last of Us In fact its quite similar to other JRPGs like Tales of Arisebut its not asking full price for early 2s game designhere are some of the bad designs you wont see from an AAA game even from a couple years agotheyre just there to waste your time to look for themthe locations look rather impressive and unique from afar but if you walk around you find things like placement of everything make no sense for people who might actually live thereno washrooms for exampleeverybody just teleports everywhere So for example instead of a door with a staircase to get in a towerthey just teleport up I could accept if only the most prestigious locations had these teleport magicbut no theyre practically common place in all but regular citieswhich makes sense in the storybut for gameplay reasons they are in fact trash and you can just buy better weapons at the next small village you visiteveryones wearing clothing fresh from the drywasherbut they all look like endgame weapons in a fantasy game none of them look any simpler or weaker than others again the gameplay is entirely divorced from the narrativeand not based on the story Youd think a magic academy might sell better weapons than a normal citybut nobecause you go there firstthey sell worse weaponsits like an NES game where the items you can have are fixedand you can have 99 of each of themonly to watch a custsceneand then travel to B for another cutsceneand then to A againfor yet another cutscenegiven character controlso you can literally walk 2 meters for the next cutscene It feels like the devs really wanted to make a visual novel and not an actual video gamethe game is completely linear except you can do some option fetch quests inbetweenlike you just bought new weaponsyou dont even get to use them before theyre outdatedand you always have only ONE best weapon at any moment In other wordsusing a new weapon is no different from just having a few more attack power in your character So why not just NOT HAVE ANY OF THESE WEAPONS Youd remove some conflicts with the story and make that more immersiveand cut down on some production costsyour team mates will safely kill the boss for youThe game is surprisingly fun and I really feel bad for the developer that The full game was cracked 1 week before its official launch on steam I bought it the first minute it was live because I wanted to support themcool skill effectsits even more detailed than many AAA gamesThis is a bilingual review in general especially for English Readerthe enemy does not feel being hit most of the time especially for the boss fightsuch than its enjoyable even if I need to pause to do something else where the music is very comfortable as usual work or sleep in most casesand it will lower your FPS significantly take up too much from GPU  PS I have 36no facial expression was properly designed This is part I believe that developer will gradually improve their designand it is more like a sword and magic world with storytelling focussure its not perfectbut compared to some recent tripleA games and new releases this yearSF 7 turned out great with its outstanding graphicsrtx on the entire timestorytellinglovely charactersand beautiful soundtrack for half the pricethis has no competitorexcept for a onetime black screen upon fast travelwhere people describe unplayable situations and how therere constant crashes on every corneri havent encountered any of thatlooking forward to starting the game over again in the futureBought this based off the digital Foundry review of it and i was NOT disappointedHaving been a longtime Sword and Fairy fan also known as Chinese Paladin in previous titles7 really outshines the previous installments and does a lot to revitalize this now nearly 2 decade old franchiseas is the removal of some of the more cliche dialogue Highly impressed by the 2 hours  demo Ive played so far and looking forward to the storythey even have marked viewpointstwo ledges that look like the same drop will have 1 be jumpable and 1 not for whatever reasonwould not recommend this game if youre not interested in the story as there are better arpgs out therethankfullly a minoritymaking autos feel clunky at timescaveat being you have to be into the Xianxia aesthetic 81Just my few short comments on the translation and some of the technical aspects So farI have liked what I’ve played and I will play more and I do recommend this gamewhich entries are called as “lives” instead of “entries”or changing fonts and spacings in the words in said codex The dialogue also shows varying translation quality with very peculiar sentence structuresyou don’t need to speak Chinese to understand what is going on and the translation is generally ok to good from my short experiencethe game is gorgeousespecially with raytracing AMD userswill have to wait ‘til future date for raytracing features at the time of writing this The unfortunate sideeffect of RT isof coursethat the game is very heavy to run with all bells and whistles on Expect to either turn on DLSS if on nVidia cards or lower other settings if you want raytracing onthe game’s settings are bit unique The game offers full screenwindowed and borderless windowed for running the game The full screen option only allows you to choose your current desktop resolution and it can be affected by any display scaling you use causing blurriness or other issues The graphical settings are your standard lowmediumhigh The raytracing options range from off to super high without ability to set specific options used DLSS ranges from super performance to qualityBUT the game only allows you to set it on or off and set the sharpness used for the DLSS DLSS is also turned on automatically if you turn on the raytracing A workaround is to set the DLSS levels either via inifile or via Geforce Experience Changing some of the settings ingame will require a restartespecially raytracing related oneswhich can be annoying The sound and music is greatbut sometimes the loudness of sounds can change A surround sound is providedgranted one has the audio system for it I experienced some clicking noise which I’m not sure if it’s a glitch or intentionalbut it was bit annoying I did not experience any crashes in the game during my short time of playing There is also object popinculling that can be very immersion breaking depending on your personal preferencesso if one wants to play especially on higher resolutionsmake sure you have more than 8gb of VRAMotherwise with memory flushing there might be short freezes The game also warns about thisif it detects the VRAM is less than 1gb on 4k resolutionnor is nVidias Ansel seemingly built inwhich is a shame because this game with its set pieces is extraordinary prettyI have played Tale of Arise and Gujian 3 which is similar genre so Im gonna make a review comparing to those 2 gamesyou rely mostly on skills for damage which is one press wonder Despite the fancy cut scenesthe actual combat is sluggish No air combono air dashdashing stuck between rocksbushes Calling itself an ARPG with this type of gameplay is really disappointingsome was bad Most main towns and sects are beautiful and packedwhile others are just empty plain and corridorsthe NPCs move on with their livesit makes you pay attention to their tidbits Kudos to thisthis is better than both ToA and Goujiana little worse than G3 The 4 main characters is a little generic with no real distinct personality or appearance I swear they look like preset chinese mmorpg characters But stillno anime cringe worthy conversation which is a blessing Slight spoiler aheadThough the ending changed little to nothing to the structure of the worldwhich renders whatever you did kinda useless Deities still stuck in their heavenly arses The pacing at the end felt kinda rushed Shotgun romanceI understand Moquing and Yo affection since then knew each other from childhoodbut what the hell is even going on between Wu Xiu and Yue their banter is cute dont get me wrongbut I dont understand where their affection came fromlike zero A huge boss fell into the waterand you hear nothing Boss stomps on the groundyou feel nothingfalling through the ground that sort of thingsI dont even understand half of what they saying lol Wrong pronoun here and there I get it Chinese language has gender neutral pronouns which can be hard for translatorsbut it looks like nobody actually played through the game and make the corrections Our girl Yue is called a dude half of the timeRamp up the combat Slow down the pacing Improve the translationAbout 12 hours into the gameIm totally into it and loving the storyand battles average difficulty are quick and numerous to keep you moving fast through different maps The story and characters are very well developed and the voice acting is excellent The world is beautiful and extremely detailed fengshui itemshistorical layout of buildingseven down to the medicine props in some citiesI sometimes forget that its a game and Im not a passive viewer These are movielike quality scenes that are superbly choreographedthe cutscenes are quite heavy in the gameof which the story is quite linear for most part and not truly an openworld RPGbut that is ok by me This is the kind of game youll probably want to play an hour or two and take a breakrushing it would ruin your experiencedown to the casual interactions with townsfolkbut then the cost of the game would have been much much higherso Im not sure if the English translations are inaccurateUp to chapter 2 so farcompleted every single side questjumping puzzle  card game the game has offered me so farstory is decent but combat is where this game shines Its so much fun and so flashyespecially the spellsthough can be a little hard to runthis is a must playI like this game Its not the best in the series but definitely above averageThis is an absolutely beautiful gameand I am very happy that we have a chance to play it with English subtitles If the dev team sees thisTHANK YOU for giving us the opportunity to experience your game I am running at 18P using a GTX 27 Super video cardand Ive had no issues so far Everything is set to High with DLSS set to Qualityand ray tracing is off I tested ray tracing and I could even run the game okay and it looked fantastic but Im leaving it off to get the smoothest gameplaywhich is right up my alley The translation is rough in a few spots but generally very goodand even quite charming at times The world design is just stunningand the music is excellent as well You will have a party of charactersI only have three at the moment and you can switch between them at will The combat is very smooth In village areas there are many items to find and pick upalong with easy side quests Theres a cooking system where you can create buff foodstheres a blacksmith system for upgrading gearand there is an ingame Library where you can read more about the charactersenemiesand even the music tracks and you can play the different tracks as well For the pricethis is an excellent game and I hope we get English translations for future games in the series RecommendedKept an eye for a long time on this game and was excited to play itThe graphics are amazingRunning the game at max settings with 144p rtx very high and getting somewhat okay fps 5 sometimes below 4This game is visually stunning one of the most gorgeous games Ive ever playedThe village is so lively and uniquedifferent from generic village you find in most rpgsbut its not dark soul difficultjust like typical wuxia storymight not be for everyone But still it is quite enjoyable this game is a stealSword and Fairy 7 is a pretty amazing game and fully translated to Englishnot perfect but enjoyable with delightful cutscenesan AA game that looks like an AAA one Perfect combo with a good OST Fights are dynamic and nervous with spectacular bosses Minigames are sympathetic with an extensive card gameone perfect thing is the small price Only 25€raytracing causes massive stutteringIm sure developers will deliver paths soon to fix themyou cannot change the difficulty setting in midgamebGraphicsbit mentions actual Chinese myththeir design is prettymain male character kinda reminds me of Cloud Strife just my opinion thoperformance and not so smooth gameplay even tho I have an high end laptop  anyway I was able to fix itread my steps below if you got the same problemclick on manage 3D settings and on Global Settings tab select Highperformance NVIDIA processor under preferred graphics processordont close the control panel and click on program settings just besides the global settings tab and select a program to customize select sword and fairy 7 and change these settingsHonestly this is such an incredible game The visuals were fantasticmusic was great and story I thought was awesome I only saw one or two glitches during the entire game that happened during fighting where everyone fell through the map right away I just reloaded the game which saved right before it and it worked fine the second timeits just not perfect SOMETIMES If thats game breaking for you then youre probably not fun at partiesOverall 81I personally recommended to give it a goturn of RTX if you got a lower end PCId say it is way worth the price Its way better than I expectedthis might be subjective but I gotta say I like this one better then Gujian3and I own both of them I managed to finish this game even Im not a WuXia guythe architecturethe locationand the main characters These are some of the best thing about the game Our female lead is no longer that innocent sweet girl who doesnt know anythingshes strongsmartcalmlogical and brave leader of the teamshes very differentone is AAA and this is notIm not sure what are they expectingI mean you wont be seeing NieR series in here for sureits not gonna be the The Last Of Usits not gonna be Inception nor Tenet Simple story doesnt mean it is a bad storylike the Lord of the Rings for example Diablo 2 is still a great gamebut you dont bash Diablo just because it hasnt got a mind bending story and same thing goes herejust go easy on it The story is decent and I liked it a lottry to save as often as you canI spend 59 hours on my first rundecided to give it another gofor people who are giving this a trydont listen too much comment from the internet and try to follow your own heart when playing the game The game has a heart Id tell yajust be patient with itTLDR chinese themed action RPG that looks like AAA game with quite affordable price  nice graphics but the specs is quite demanding for PCthose with low to mid spec PC might not be able to play the game smoothly English translation a little bit too stiff but still understandableUpdated The game crashes again and my save is no longer accessible This is the 2nd time I lose all my progress I give up on this gametoo buggyI have more fun with the combat and art design than Tale of Arises Thats is really huge imo since I think SnF7 is from a small dev team Howeverit is so buggylike the worst This is like a beta test rather than a proper release and we are paying for itfinancially and timely After playing for a whilegame fps will drop to under 1 and the only way to fix it is to restart the client I have 2h into the game and it crashes NowI can not load my save and I think Ill have to redo from the beginning ridiculouseven though I really like it when it worksand it is really nice to see a Wuxia theme gamenot even counting the fact that anytime I could be screwed into losing my save and its progress The game has so much potentialyet is buried through its massive bug issueswhen the dev polishes out this gameI think it will be a really fun package to play and test your system graphic and OC
1,Its funbut it feels empty without the very overpriced DLC764 DLC for the full gameEAThe game is pretty coolbut seriously Cmon EA You couldnt even give us pets for free EVERY DLC COSTS AS MUCH AS THE GAME Thats like buying another copy I just hate how you have to put a price tag on every little thing Please pay 6 to unlock the rest of this reviewThis game is great butand every DLC costs the same The game doesnt feel complete without owning at least 5 DLC packsbut I dont have 482 dollars to throw away at some game from 214 Its so hard to decide what to buy because there are so many packs that go togethersome that arent complete without anotherand some that just have a couple Itmes I really want but is too expensiveSims 4 is a lot of fun but the exorbitant prices on the DLC are just too much The DLC really adds a lot to the game so not having it hurts88 off is a damn good price for what its offering I recommend it highlyIt is fun You can spend hours playing itbut the fact that the DLCs cost as much as the base game is outrageous If there was a meh ratingI would give it simply because of thatThere should be a competing title in this genre so that EA wont keep cashing in on this community which has been more and more lenient and tried its best to put up with whatever bs dlc the devs have put together Its a shame that this franchise has fallen so fartheyre some of the most cored features toothe amount of time for a sim to perform actionidling is nonsensicalsuch a shame to see so much game design potential being thrown into the trash because they chose the easy way outAs expectedthe decision here came back to bite them when they design some of the dlc contentwhich feels really disrupted by the constant fast travellingif u bought  every dlc in the sims 4 it would roughly cost 7 dollars you could either buy a ps5 or every dlc in the sims 4It really should be free on Steam if you own it on Originb Fun gamebut 8 for full content is a little bit higheven for EA  b11 love making myself as a sim and drowning myself whenever im depressed from looking at the dlc pricesGreat gamebut the downloadable content is much too expensive for how little it offers I find myself spending countless hours playing the gamebut when I want specific things in my gamethat you can only get from the DLC and not modsit annoys me because I dont want to spend my whole paycheck on a tiny little specific detail that makes a world of differenceI play The Sims since my early teenage years Loved every minute playedclassic EA making the game boring without paying for the DLCs with each one costing the same as the base gameI love The Sims I love The Sims 4 Heres why I dont recommend ityou will need to redownload any DLCeven if you already had it installedthe base game does notwhich means youll have to purchase the base game againif you purchased it on Origin because of course it doesntjust use add nonSteam game to library Its almost identical and 2 cheaperYou have to buy DLC packs that are near the price of the actual game to get content that you would expect to be part of the game to begin with The vanilla barebones experience is a stale snore feast and I refuse to support scummy EAs garbage business practices with their stupid expansionsTLDR DO NOT BUY BASE SIMS 4 Buy it HEAVILY DISCOUNTED bundled with one of the major expansions Seasons or Petsand MOD THE SHIT OUT OF ITrepetitive and easily manipulative emotions systemand an overall feeling of restriction Which is damaging in a game series that is designed around player freedom There are also so many irritating qualities to it that make it seem like it wasnt fine tweaked enough Why is every single Sim such a social butterfly that I cannot get them to stop talking to each other for five seconds Why do they take so long to eat Why are the lots so small and so empty Why is nearly nothing from Sims 3and heckeven Sims 2 brought over HorsesCarspoolsrestaurantsgrocery storesfun recreational activitiesectthere is some classic Sim Fun to be had with this gameif you are able to get it for a heavily discounted price and get it bundled with one of the major expansions I would recommend either Pets or Seasons I would also highly recommend downloading a plethora of Modsbecause they fix a vast majority of the systems in base Sims 4 that make it more enjoyable If Mods are not your thingthen I would think twice about purchasing this game This is one of the easiest games to Mod fyidont even play base Sims 4 before downloading these Modsbut a very convenient and easy way to keep track of your mods Very user friendlywill do 1 of the work for youand significantly less manipulatableyou are basically always guaranteed to succeed in romance There is quite literally no way to fail This Mod expands heavily upon itmaking it so that the traits Sims have will impact whether or not they will accept any advancesfirst ImpressionsPersonality Archetypesand even a Menstrual Cycle and Birth Control system With thisyou are more equipped to design your Sims overall sexuality and sexual lives Hugely rewardingand designed perfectly that it will seem like it is a natural part of the gamehairbuildingsSimsect Mod The Sims is the best place to find all of this Dont spend money on any of the Stuff Packsbecause most of that stuff included in them youll find for free made by someone online Usually looks nicer too85 Of DLCThe base game has about 5 worth of content Why Because EA do what EA doesit cost around 2 cad to get the full game I wish I was kidding The DLC cost just that much and they put so little into the base game so in order to enjoy the game you have to buy the DLC Why do people support this crap How is this legal

1,iwritten for version 51ian objective basedcoop onlyfirstperson shooter whererather than your avatar being largely defined by the gun you pick or the items and abilities you equiptheyre already fully formed characters with their own uniquepredefined abilities and specific rolesbut the main thrust of the game is Siege modewhich sees two teams of five charge to the centre of a map and try to hold an objective zone While theres a lot of nuance to the mechanics and conditions of playthe fundamentals are this  capturing an objective zone to spawn a payload earns your team one point escorting the payload to the enemy base earns you another point but if the opposing team manages to successfully prevent the payload from reaching their base within a set timethen they earn the point First to four points wins the matchor championstechnically fall into one of four different roles  front line tanks made to take punishment and hold the objective  damage made to dish out said punishment  support primarily focused on healing  and flank who are all about being sneakysneaky and harassing the enemy from behind I say technicallybecauseeven though thats how theyre labelled ingamemost champions can bleed into a couple of roles to varying degreesthen youre kinda screwed and more or less have to endure a horribly unbalanced game where a team lacks any real cohesion and synergy But to help with this to some degree are loadouts and itemsand during your time outside of matchesyou can construct your own loadout based on five of these cards which boosts the effectiveness of their abilities Items are like temporary versions of cards that can be acquired mid game but are only applied for the duration of the match and bought with credits earned during play And finallythere are Legendary cardswith each champion having three of these but needing to commit to one for the whole match These are cards which apply a massive bonus to one of your abilities and can make your champ highly specialised in one aspect of performance or another But this is where you have to be really carefulas choosing the wrong cards or items could make or break how a match goesI thinkas it allows for a lot of strategy and means the player with the best aim or reflexes wont necessarily be the victor In factone of the things I love so much about the game is how accessible it is to so many different skill levels and styles of play If you just want to do the shooty pewpew thingtheres plenty of characters thatll have you covered there Maybe your aim isnt so good but you have a keen sense of timing and situational awarenessin which case healer might be the role for you Or maybe you just like being a stonkin great big tank throwing your weight around at the centre of it all Theres a little something for just about everyonecreative characters that somehow manage to all play massively differently from one another Both the design and artwork really shines throughand is topped off with great animation and largely topnotch voice acting Theres an abundance of detail in every aspect of themwhether its some little nicks and scuffs on the side of a firearmor even the motions as they actually fire and are reloadedor just the way a character moves around and performs each of their abilitiesor even how they idle Theres a real sense of love and attention thats very clear to seeand that extends to every aspect of the presentation both throughout the UI and within each of the many maps as well Andif anythingthis only seems to be getting better as more and more interesting and creative content is being released with admirable and impressive regularitywhile Im at it I think special mention has to go to the audio as well Sound is very important in this game as every single champion has their own noisesfrom the sounds of their abilities being activatedto their main weapon being firedto the stomps of their feet If you listen out to whats going on around you then theres an awful lot of information to be found just by keeping your ears open At any given moment youll likely be able to tell exactly whos firingroughly what direction theyre inand probably even how far away they are A lot of players probably arent even consciously aware of itbut its always there and making a huge differencemore so than just about any other game I can immediately think ofthoughas the game does have its fair share of problems PersonallyI think the damage feedback is desperately in need of improvement Having the very outer edge of the screen momentarily turn a faint red hardly seems adequate in the heat of combatand at this point Ive lost track of the number of times Ive died without even knowing I was being attacked in the first place But a bigger issue than that is the matchmakingbut Im only a few more bad games away from calling it that It feels like its becoming increasingly hard to get games with consistantly matched players of equal skilland 4 stomps are becoming more of a thing lately  which are never funno matter what side of them youre on The rating systemon the other handI think at this point I can call broken In Competitive modeboth your individual champions and your overall account ratings are awarded or docked points based on whether you win or loseand then presumably used to calculate further matchmaking as it attempts to queue you up with players of equal skill The trouble with this system isit seems so focused on the bottom line win or lose result and has little bearing on personal preformance As a resultyou could play the best game of your lifebut if you were teamed up with bad playersor someone on your team was disconnected or there were heavy lag issuesthe game doesnt really care and will still deduct you for it Its really not fun when you feel as though youre being punished regardless of your own ability or contributionand as it stands right nowmy own personal rating for both my account and many of my champions are in the toilet despite my consistant above average performances And the worse thing isthat effect only seems to be confounded with timeas it takes multiple wins to make up the points for a single lossdue to recent changesthe grind for new players seems a little rough going Cards need to be unlocked through a random loot chest system or bought with essense from duplicate cardswhich could take a while and doesnt exactly encourage new player experimentation Althoughto its creditits nowhere near being paytowinand I think HiRez are generally pretty reasonableand maybe even generouswith its current financial modeland some or all of what Ive written could be completely irrelevent a year from nowfor better or worse But if it does changeI really hope it will be for goodand that Ill still be playing it and loving it just as much then as I do nowI dont quite know how play this game but when people call me retarded in the chat it help me understand how to play ThanksSummary of paladinsdeveloper badAmelia WatsonAme best ground pounding announcerMomcan i use your credit card to buy OverwatchI still have to give this a weaker Not Recommended THE CARD SYSTEM DESCRIBED BELOW IS GONEand the current system is better than everwhich is great Gameplay currently lacks variety all gamemodes boil down to 5v5 team deathmatch on similar mapswhich made the gameplay get old quick for meand unfortunately HiRez is still doing some shady things egforgetting to mention in advance that they would change the price of voicepacks from being obtainable with the free currencyto exclusively bought with the premium currency Daily quests are the main thing keeping me logging inyou might still find a game that you likebut hopefully it helps you make an informed decision FirstIll try to explain what the game was like prior to this patchyou had three 5v5 PvP game modes Onslaught team deathmatch mixed with king of the hillPayload similiar to TF2one team pushes a cart down a track and then switches sides after the round endsand Siege king of the hillwhere the team winning the hill pushes a cart similar to Payload There was also a rankedcompetitive queue for Siege Less popularbut still around are training versions of each game mode where you fight against botsand custom games which work more like your traditional server browser matches You would queue up for one or more modesthen select your characterand then select your loadout once you loaded into the mapof which you selected 5 to make a loadout Each character had multiple abilitiesand these cards modified how their abilities workedor in some cases the stats of the character healthmovement speedetc These cards had different effectssuch as reduce cooldown on ability Xor increase distance on ability Y When making a loadoutyou could choose how powerful you want these cards to beon a scale from 1 to 4 For exampleat level 1 a card might increase the distance you travel when you use a dash ability by 1while a level 4 card might increase it by 4 The cards in your loadout had to add up to 12 points for exampleyou could have a loadout with card levels 44211 Each character also had a premade loadout you could use if you werent interested in setting up your own loadout When you selected a loadout in matchyou also selected one of three legendary cards separatelywhich were similar to the basic cards but had only one level and much bigger effectsone issue with this previous system was how you obtained new cards for a character You always started with 5 basic cards and 1 legendary card unlocked for a new characterenough to have a loadout ready to go howeverto obtain new cardsyou had to open up a loot box that contained all of the cards in the game You were unlikely to get the card you wanted unless you were pretty luckybut any duplicates granted you a crafting currency Essence that you could use to buy the cards directly The lootboxes were a little priceybut you did receive some from hitting certain XP milestones on your characters and general accountand you could buy them with the currency you earned just from playing the game Gold Depending on how many characters you playedit could be pretty hard to get all of the cards you wantedespecially the legendary cards which were a lot rarer in the lootboxes and much more expensive for direct purchase This was never really an issue for me given how much I playedbut it was definitely a bigger issue for new playersand give all cards to you for free They also changed the old loadout system instead of modifying the levels of 5 cards to create a 12 point loadoutyou instead just select 5 cards that have a fixed level Some are upset about this second changesince it reduces the number of combinations you can makethe change that has probably caused the greatest outcry is leveling up cards Instead of having levels 14they are now level 11 now including the legendary cards When you unlock a new characteryour cards start at level 1 and are pretty weak By level 1the cards are muchmuch stronger A card that increases the distance on a dash ability might given you 5 at level 1 and 5 at level 1 Another card might reduce the remaining cooldown of an ability when you kill a player at level 1 its a 1 reductionwhile at level 1 its a 1 reduction These values are taken from real cards A player with a loadout full of level 1 cards will have significant stat advantages over a player with a loadout of level 1 cards To play devils advocatethe previous system probably wasnt totally fair to newer players either the experienced player had more cardsand thus more flexibility in how they built their loadout It wasnt a perfect system Howeverin many cases I think the extra cards opened up sidegradesrather than straight advantages over other playersand after you collect a certain number of duplicates of a specific card it levels up So many duplicates are required to max out a character at the momentthat even pretty hardcore veteran players like myself dont have enough currency to max out 1 of the currently 34 characters At the moment these loot boxes can only be purchased with the in game currency Goldor be obtained from your first few wins in a day Stilleven without a maxed out characterI dont feel comfortable having a straight stat advantage over newer players in a PvP game like thisthose that pay for these services are going to be able to get more lootboxesand therefore level up their cards quicker They have also talked about putting a premium currency option for buying these lootboxes as wella more direct pay to win 116218 EDIT Earlier todaythey quietly added an option for purchasing these lootboxes via a currency that can be purchasedall of the above saidPaladins might still be the game for you If you are only interested in the Siege gamemode the main gamemodethere are queues available where everyones cards are set to the same levelboth casual and competitiveaka Cards Bound Card leveling has no effect on these matches at all You can just set up your loadout and be on an even playing field with everyone elseif youre like meand never enjoyed Siege but did like Payload and Onslaughtyoure out of luck Onslaught and Payload are exclusively available using leveled cardsaka Cards Unbound technically Payload uses fixed level cardsbut that is likely a bug Alsothe developers have stated that any future gamemodes including the upcoming Team Deathmatch and Battlegrounds will be exclusive to the leveled cards queuebut I cannot recommend this game to others This is mainly due to the above reasonsbut also a few other problems groups stomping solo queuersPayload getting removed entirely in OB65bugs I care about persisting for monthsetcI hope it was helpful If these problems are addressed in the futureI plan to update this reviewi pick the tree and throw the axe and when big number pop up i get the serotoninIve loved this game Ive logged so many hours into it and had a great passion for the

quickerJust Breatheincreases crossbow damage 25375562575 per cent over 1 unitsPaladins is a hero shootermuch in the likes of Overwatchbut with more pronounced MOBA elements The cast of numerous characters is colorful and they all have their own personalityeven though some of them come off as rushed or not very well thought out The graphics are serviceablewhich means they are not the best but not the worst either they are colorful and get the job donewhich allows you to customize each and every hero with your personal play style It’s rare that you’ll see two players using a certain hero the same wayand this makes the game less stale overtime than other similar offerings Because of thiseach and every game ends up playing differentlyand this is exactly what I love about the gamewhich means that despite being free to play and not counting individual skillno player will ever be stronger than anotherevents and new heroes extremely frequently Even though some bugs and glitches tend to stay longer than necessary at timesthey rarely become game breaking or end up taking away from the enjoyment of the gameand this balance is very difficult to achieve nowadays A well crafted card systemcolorful heroes and good shooting mechanics make this game a joy to playallowing it to stand out among the crowd of otherwise stale titles offered by much more renowned names in the industryTiddies Jiggleim back for amelia watswonNo Money For Overwatch The gameIve made it past the 12 hours mark and I think Im qualified enough to leave a decent reviewdont expect it to be especially because its still in BETA People Like to compare it to the big Osure there are some similarities but this game is a completely different experience It has more MOBA elements to it loadoutsmounts and the credit system are what makes this game versatile and more complex It has a great selection of Champions and im sure youll find someone thatll match your playstylethey need to switch it up soonthey are releasing updates once every 2 weeks That is very impressive to me They listen to the players and they make sure updates are pushed on timei dont what would convince you I mean you have nothing to lose I honestly think this is the reason why this game is getting so much hate from the other community It hurts their ego that people are actually enjoying a freetoplay gameweapons and crystals if you watch the Official Paladins Streams on Twitch You dont have to spend a dime you can unlock a lot stuff More stuff at their websiteHiRez Servers are probably the worst game servers ive personally encountered The amount of down time in this game because of server issues is disgusting Dont even get me started on the drop hacks By the way SEA servers are still messed upfirst game you get 9pingnext  game you get 4ping Its been months and still not fixednext update shes buffed It can be a little discouraging sometimesPaladins has a lot of content and still has tons of potential They are slowly adding lore and integrating nice story to some of the characters New awesome skins and weapons that you can mix and match If you really want to make the most out of this gameI say play with an open mind and stop comparing everything to other gamesonly then you will see its own beautyits balanced because every champion is broken and as Syndrome once said When everyones super Noone will beHonestly not bad if you just accept the bugs into your lifePros Its freetoplay OverwatchThis game wants me to kill myself 11Everything is trash but its fun

1,The game is good but the developers are going the wrong wayWorld of warship has reached a new low Everybody knows that every game company’s goal is to milk players for as much money as possible Smart companies do it so that player pay because they are happy Wargaming’s way is to treat players with contempt Wargaming demands its CCs to show “respect” while treating truth tellers and players with none Blatant falsehood during money grab only gets lame “apologies” when exposed  How it’s PR department in Russia not get fired is beyond meI am old And struggle to keep up games that are too fast This game allows me time to think and plan and also be a good judge of distance I only like playing tier 5 and I dont get all the campaign and battle stuff Please keep it fun for old hacks like me thankyouTo login with a current World of Warships  Wargaming accountwhen you get to the login screenDO NOTHING exit the application completely by hitting the little X in the top right hand corner

play on your wargaming account just go to steamsteamappscommomworld of warships and rename steamapidll fileSo I went through the effort of downloading and launching this game for 5 minutes just to write this review So if you are new to the game and genuinely wanting an honest opinion on itplease read my words carefullysince the main perks of premium ships is increased credit and exp incomewhich at low tiers is moot as you make profit easilybut you can and will throw a game if you are high enough tier and do not pull your weightdemount a placed upgrade for use in another ship without spending credits and to retrain your commander instantly when placed on a new shipthe better The number is basically saying that at your maximum range shells fired have a chance to land anywhere in an oval shaped area with a length of that many metersunless you are playing low tiered battleships that have ass dispersion by designmind youbut by no means were they as accurate as tanks or sniper rifles Simply putIf you know how to aim and are skilled in leading and predictionyou can and will have a few shells hit your target per long range salvo Medium to ideal engagement rangesyou will see most of your shells hitting Which is pretty realistic if you ask meThat system is less realisticbut it is more consistentIt will shatter and deal no damageand the shell isnt past a certain sizeit will bounce and deal no damagethe shell will over penetrate and not have a chance to detonate its warhead inside the target for its regular amount of damageHE shells have their own mechanicsbut are even more consistentPlaced in an enclosed map with key areas that you need to takeit is not a sailing simulator You can and will encounter players at every tier that are playing to win and maintain their stats Just like any online gameexpect some toxic ingame chats if people have slighted each other It can largely be ignoredrefusing teamworkTeamkillingdamage etcall content is available to you instantlythis game is absolutely nothing to worry aboutbut paying players and free players all have to still grind a significant amount And no amount of premium ships or economic grinding bonuses will make someone a skilled playerArpeggioor Haifuri As there have been collabs in the past and some interesting weeb skins and mods availableThis game is addicting and you live for the highs of the gameplay But its also addicting in the sense of a predatory freetoplay game The expenses of all the paid parts of the game are INSANEships going up to £100premium timeresourcesreallocating points and equipment You get so wrapped up that you start rationalising spending stupid amounts of money on a single digital ship Everything in this game is pressuring you to spend moneybut the balance and resultant metas are frustrating and long lasting That you have to choose between fighting mindless W pressing botsor island hiding HE spamming snipersHololiveShould start by saying the 600 hours logged here is FAR FROM how many hours I have invested in this game I would assume my actual play time is somewhere between 20003000 hours in total Maybe even way more I could be so far off on this number Ive basically unlocked the majority of T10 ships as well as a good number of freemiums and hellIve even spent money on the game though my wallet regrets thatyou are in control of big boats and shooting big guns at other ships Its a blast and mechanically the game is MOSTLY Important here sound So well go through a quick pros and consangle your ship correctlyhave great brawling drivebys in battleships Its a blast when it worksCV Carriersand the upcoming submarines all limit the ability to utilize tactics and work correctly as a team These three things really damage the core tactical gameplay that makes the game greatSmolenskColbertRussian BattleshipsRussian Heavy CruisersStalingradSAP Yeahthere is a lot here Some has been somewhat fixed but a lot is still problematic and this is parasitic mess that isnt being solved faster than its being expandedShipsConverting XPBuying DoubloonsBuying Creditsyadayadayada There is a lot of monetization in this game and its REALLY important for people to be aware of this before jumping inunfortunatelysums up most of the interaction with WG and their staff Its a dodgy company with horrible public relationsWG advertises it as if you can get ANY of the 107 premiums when in actuality you can only get a handful of ships Im not going to explain this in detailinstead I insist you go to the forum post below and look this up Its VERY scummy since this actually takes advantage of peoples wallet WHILE being COMPLETE false advertisementbut I just dont see that happening with WG at the helmAt the current state of the gamethey just dont care about the playerbase unless you throw money at themthe christmas event free tier 10 ship is a impossible jokethey lied in our facesIm going to be honestmultiplayer games are something I steer away from in generaltoxic communities and being headshotted by people way better than me are not my idea of funtempted in by the loving care given to real historical ships I thoughthellwhats the harm in giving it a goand the rants in the ingame chat are simply nonexistent for the most partthis is moves played out over minutes not secondsand the joy of pulling it offand the slow agony of getting it wrong and knowing youre doomedall adds to a superb atmospherenever overwhelmingalways excitingand perfectly pacedloot crates done right imo You cant buy themits not hard to earn at least one per day after 12 battlesand in 4 weeks Ive had two super containers drop containing real world valuable itemsno pay to win Yesyou can pay to advance quicker premium increasing XP and Credits awarded but all premium ships come with drawbacks to balance them out just check the wiki for each Nothing is a game winner by defaultand yes a day one player can buy a high tier ship and jump into end game battles but they wont have fun and they wont do it for long The road to successand the fun of the gameis learning to fight effectively through the tiersthere is a ridiculous amount to do herewith every battle uniqueand a ton of campaigns and time limited events to focus onwhats not to lovethis might just be the best game Ive ever played on Steamokthis is the best game Ive ever played on Steam  125 hours logged3 years of solid play without any significant breaks and still so much to do and achieveincredibleThis is a review I did not want to make For backgroundIve been silently playing WOWS for around 25 years While not a proI consider myself to be an well above average player that has a fairly deep understanding of the game and where its at in 2021 Ive sunk thousands of hours into this game both for fun and in the competitive scene While I have no doubt new players may be able to pick up the game and have fun for a whilethere are several core systematic issues that make it so I cannot in good faith recommend this game to someone whos looking to play longterm Heres my thoughts on what the game does goodbadand the biggest reason why I simply cant recommend it in 2021to the landscapeto the effects it looks great and performs well on many different levels of hardwaremost not are getting released at a very quick pace which is great to combat game fatigueovermatchCV 3D spotting the game is easy to play at a low level but the mechanics are complex enough that even beta players are still learning every nuance and will be for years to comebut I actually enjoy the rate of progression Compared to something like WarThunder MUCH slower rate of progressionI think they struck a much better balance of grind vs accomplishmentwhat we are left with is a horrendous excuse for a class that statistically has the highest damagenearly the highest average killshighest spottingthe by FAR lowest death rateand the highest impact in the game by far They are not fun to playand really not fun to play against Total and complete failurethey continue to ignore playertesterand community contributor feedback on ship balance They know its an issue internallyand the proof is in the pudding For the last two clan battles theyve had 6 ships so powerful they had to be bannednumber restricted Players have been shouting about these ships for months with no adjustments Theres also legacy ships that have been broken for years and their solution is to simply remove them from sale instead of implementing smart progressive adjustments to existing shipsthey released it in a broken state surprise and that led to a complete reinforcement of the sniper BB meta deadeye Beyond thatthey made many nonsensical changes that increase the point cost of vital skills Commander total points was raised from 19 to 21which in its own isnt an issue The XP required to go from 1921 is damn near as much as it takes to get from 319 This means that the vast majority of the community will not only never have a 21 point commander further increasing the veterannew player gap but it makes it so that few players are acquiring elite commander XP which can be used to retrain commanders on another ship They now charge around 500 doubloons payed currency for the retrainingJuliet Charlie provides b100b resistance to detonation a completely random mechanic that 1 shots your shipor India Delta that grants 20 to the amount of HP healed while using repair party While I think they shouldnt exist in generalI have to note these flag were able to be easily acquired via completely free means of completing missions and reaching achievements ingame like First Blood getting the first kill of a game The last patchthey completely removed the latter possibility They did so with little to no communication that they would do so because obvious fear of backlash The only realistic means to acquire these flags is now to spend currency doubloonsstraight buying themcoal  which you can effectively buy with IRL money Make no mistakethese flags are not optional They provide such a utterly massive advantage over others that you are required to run at the very least the core flags to succeed at a high level The company has made it clear with this decision that they are okay with obvious forms of paytowin and will risk the backlash for more profit The divide between new and veteran players is already so largeand this is truly the nail in the coffin For this reasonand the others listed I will be parting ways with this game and I hope anyone considering playing this game competitivelylongterm will reconsider In the year 2021 they do not care about preserving gameplaythey just want money Pay upor watch your ship go up in flamesIf you played any other Wargaming multiplayer game you should know already what to expectI cannot in good conscience recommend it I played way more than the 200ish hours before and after the game went on Steam Gameplay is fun as soon as you take a couple of hours to understand the mechanics Graphics are fineso are the sounds and musicup to about tier 5you get the good stuff Its easy to earn creditsyou unlock new modules and ships every few battlesyou feel like you are progressing and making a difference And when youre hookedyou hit the wall Game becomes a grindfest You need to play lower tier battles just to make credits UNLESS you buy a premium account Or a premium ship Or premium camouflages You have oh so many options You can also buy lootboxeserr I mean containers Or skip the middle men and just buy credits outright with real moneyso thats nice BUTexpect to get hit with enormous amounts of grindthats where loss aversion marketing kicks in After all you can just pay and get that prem thingie right now They really outdid temselves in British Destroyers event  you could earn guineas to get a premium tier  british destroyer You just needed to get 50 guineaswhich you could earn at a rate of 4 per weekor buy at I think about 075 euro apiece But heres the catch  you could only earn 4 guineas by playing If you wanted the ship you had to pay something And I bet a lot of players didnt read the event announcement extremely long because the event was complicated like hell carefully enough to notice that you couldnt earn all the 50 guineas in gameIm very skeptical of most of the reviews of this game as a long time playerCruiserand Battleship all had their rolesand had a good meta game Destroyers are the kind of sneaky low HP guys that are fast Battleships are the big slow brawler type Cruiser is someplace in the middle The game was goodall the main classes had strengths and weaknesses Aircraft carriers CVs existed but were difficult to play and largely ignoredwith totally different mechanicsthat basically just ignore what is going on and impose their will however they want  You can not defend against the class as antiaircraft fire is basically worthless You cant out maneuver a CV because their planes are so much faster and more nimble You can not outplay a CV player whom is not brain deadperiod The class is so broken if you have anymore than 1 on each side in a gameit simply becomes a nightmare for most of the players Basically this class doesnt belong in the gameperiod Whomever came up with the new CV mechanics is smoking moon rocks Then rather admit the rework was basically just keep pushing them because failure is not an optionthe game is structured in such a way to cause to frustration either though limited resources or long grinding in order to get you to buy stuff Im not really against this part but after you play a while you will realize how much of this game is aimed at whales There is a nonstop amount of new shipseven though they are broken and not tested half the timeor special events to get players to spend money on top the already aggressive monetization systemwe are talking AAA game cost for 1 ship There are other special high end ships that require a resource like in XPwhere if you where to buy the XP to buy the ship it would cost 300 Even after buying a ship then the game still screws youas you need a captain to go along with it Now if you want your captain to have skills you will either have to play the captain a lotor spend a bunch of money to level them on your ship you just shelled out for If you want to level them even faster you can buy flagsand camos that give you more captain XP They also basically doubled the captain XP cap earlier this year to make it even worseyouve played 650 hours how bad can it be Look Ive played and had some funbut overall Ive had a lot of not fun watching the game continue to erode what I thought made it great in the past To be fair it could still be a great game but never will be unless there are leadership changes at Wargamingbecause that is what it isgo for itbut dont say I didnt tell youTry itdont buywith a gentle learning curve and protected matchmaking for new players Itll be fun Youll research new shipsunlock missionsjoin a clanand then youll inevitably hit a fun wall Try being in a match against enemy Aircraft Carriers and having virtually no counter Try being in a match with a Tier 5 glass cannon Cruiser against veterans in Tier 7 ships that sink you with one salvo The power difference between tiers is slight to start withand very wide at the top tiers And this is a game that wants you to be at the bottom of the food chainso youll pay to get to the top fasteror pay for a Premium ship because you think it will help you It wontbut driven by marketing decisions and predatory practices sunk cost fallacyfear of missing out that emphasises corporate greed over player enjoyment this is bad It was once fairly balancedwith only the United States Navy and Imperial Japanese Navyand no Aircraft Carriers But then came GermanBritishFrenchCommonwealthPanAmericanPanEuropeanand of course Russian Its a Russian companyand they swear there is no bias They try to make all nations have different playstyles this is good but as more ships are added the internal balance becomes more ridiculousso now we have French Destroyers that go over 55 knotsand European torpedoes that travel at over 90 knotsthe biggest gunsand fastturning turrets We are all waiting Russian Aircraft Carriers to be introduced to see what these apex predators look like As a general rulethe better a ship was in real life the worse it will be in the gamebecause reality imposes design compromises that paper ships dont And this is a company that claim Realism is part of the game DNA Researchable ships are meant to represent a entire classbut Premium ships are marketed to represent their historical namesake and appeal to collectors The models can look fantasticbut never forget that gameplay comes first and accuracy takes a back seat Speed and gun calibre may matchbut rudder shift speedsturning circleaccelerationturret traversevelocitypenetrationbursting chargestorpedoesAAand most of all concealment are simply a fantasy Put emotion aside youre not buying the real ship and when I say buy I really mean rentand the rewards have been nerfed We now have a Research Bureau for an elite of players who have researched 5 ship lines all the way to Tier 10 to get extra goodies the community protested because it locks away advantages behind a grindwalland nobody really wanted to regrind entire lines they already spent years on We are going to get Submarines shortlyto add a fifth matchmaking class nobody asked for thembut it will help sell new ships so were getting them and to hell with the gameplay experience The developers claim that change is needed to avoid stagnation but the community are dropping out from change fatigue It is no coincidence that the positive reviews you will read are from those with hours played in single or double digits the negative ones from those with hundreds and thousands of hours played who are passionate about the game and extremely disappointed But the same people driving these bad decisions are still in their jobsand the money is flowing inand thats all they care about When it comes to the players the developers always choose the path of least generosityfor their virtual ie worthless stuffbut when players who pay real money for stuff feel cheated theyd rather upset everybody rather than contemplate any compensation Thats who youre dealing withguyseg a complete overhaul of captain skills that promised diversity but only cemented a minmax approach for all classes and completely destroying Cruisers as a viable ship in the PVP game World of Warships is in a very bad place right nowand thats before entirely new mechanics are introduced Submarines and Aviation Battleships Avoidavoidavoid Uninstalled with a heavy heart because I loved the game when it was fun 201 was a great yearwaitwhere are the anime girlsHow to have fun in World of WarshipsEverything is moneyTHIS IS FOR PLAYERS WHO ALL READY HAVE WARGAMIN LOGINS Once a great and promising gamenow full of powercreep and milking the playerbase of as much money as possibleor nonsensically implemented mechanics on new ships new ships  more opportunities of spending money
1,Forced PVP after lvl 3 you can toggle off pvp but this only makes it so YOU cant attack others but others can still attack youbut just information about the game that shows some of the negatives

same dubious qualitygreedy companybecause they love MMORPG genre so they wish to sink in some new world of MMORPGNEOWIZyou are one of the worst gaming companiesat least on the Planet Earth117 hours at time of review and I really can NOT recommend this game Between the unhelpful community and other garbage mechanicsthis game very quickly lost its luster to me It was fun as heck at first but Now that Im stuck waiting for the marketplace to come back up  waiting for weekly resets  saw how people are once you get to level 35 Im just not interested anymore Once some other games drop in another week or sothis game is getting uninstalledimpactful combatit feels satisfying to level uppublic bossesdungeonsresource harvestingitem craftingPvP and the longyet usually satisfying grind to increase your gear scoreI found myself really enjoying the visuals in several of the areas available to exploreso even with all of the cons Im about to listyou might as well try it I guesselves Then you have what equates to a twink dwarf and a charr from GW2the instant you run into a boss that has mechanicsthey quit They want to give upblame everyone else and leave the dungeon The matchmaking system will often pair you up with a bunch of people who are beyond unwilling to help you learn somethingif its your first time It seems very elitest and very git gud scrubwait an hour and hope that they can get it before another player doesquests force you into PvP zones Alsothere seems to be no limit on who can attack who If youre level 5OH WELL A level 45 can come in and wreck your face THAT BEING SAID While I was running around in those zonesI only ran into player killers a couple of timesit starts becoming really difficult to increase your score further Youre stuck waiting for the Daily Weekly Unsure resets of the timed dungeons in the hopes that you get lucky It wouldnt be so bad if these MMOs would stop putting in these weekly limits on things I WANT TO FARM THE DUNGEON UNTIL I GET WHAT I WANT Not have to wait for MONTHS just to farm it enough times to have a realistic chance of getting the specific item I wantif not thousands of times to get enough of its mythic crafting materials to craft ONE piece of gear Need to make some better potions because the ones you buy from shops are utter crap Enjoy having to collect thousands of herbs or spend tons of Star Seeds just to make a batch of maybe 1 potions Of courseyou can buy what you need from players but OOF Expensive Guess Im stuck farming up tons of herbs to selluninspired quest line Go here Pick up 1 of these Go there Kill 2 of those Go fight the big baddy boss Rinse Repeat Blehyou have to buy unbinding scrolls which cost Star Seeds to be able to unbind the item which has a limited number of unbinds before it can no longer be unbound and then place it in the marketit would be whatever if a games main trading system is down for a little bit Not in this game Its a major problem because the only way to realistically increase your gear score is to buy higher grade items from other playerssay1 to 2 which increases your gear score But if you fail to upgrade the item because of the super low chancethe item will break You can still use it It doesnt lower the items stats But you can no longer enhance it without getting a repair hammer for the specific grade of item that you have DCBAS Each of these repair hammers costs A Star SeedsB Soul Crystals or C Artifact Cores Star Seeds are a tad annoying to acquire but they do add up overtimeespecially if you do your draw 3 every day Soul crystals seem to take forever to farm and Artifact Cores take a good while to farm up a decent amount of them Ohalsoyou need Artifact Cores to upgrade your gearso spending your cores on hammers is not a good idea as well as some basic things from other vendors Also used in equipment enhancementthough you get so much gold in the gameits effectively uselessdoing major pieces of content such as long quest lines and doing your 6 daily gold to star seed exchangesas well as buying certain items to allow you to upgrade your gear further  repair it if it breaks Obtained by breaking down useless gearyou get maybe 5 of them Used to buy rewards chestsrepair hammers and other itemswhich you get from dungeons You can also get some of these by doing your weekly Prestige Quests Used for purchasing items from the Warriors Talent Shopas well as purchasing Union buffssuch as a flat  increase to get double resources from nodes you harvest5 defensedealing increased PvP damageyou can expand your storage by hunting down chests out in the world but for every 1 spaceyou have to find 4 chests Im sitting at 125 storage capacity right now and it still doesnt feel like enough When you first start out at level 1you have 45 or 5 storage One of the two OOF It feels badespecially if you want to mass collect ALL OF THE RESOURCESedit its actually can be a bit of fun for like 5  1 hours if you are into MMORPGs but the foreseeable problems are pretty apparentits worse than BDOits just expstar seed boosts that should be in the game either waybut it was an enjoyable launch month of an MMORPG to 3 with friends  See yall at the next Bless Launchbut I just want to get my point acrossUnleashedMobile I have very little issues with the current state of Unleashed It is a competent freetoplay Korean MMORPG Howeverthe business practices of the parent company mean you need to avoid this gameBless was originally announced in 211 as a Unreal 3 RPG When it eventually got released in regions KoreaRussiaJapanand the West NAEU it failed immensely So much so that it got repeated rereleases in some regions and was shut down on Steam in under 18 monthsMaking as much money as quickly as possible This should not be a surprise since Neowiz in mainly a mobile developer Somehow in the early 21s they obtained about 5m million to make a PC MMORPG That project failed immensely and since then they have been whoring out the assets as much as possible to try make a returnJapanRussiathen the Westthe tons of assets reused from Bless Onlineor the even more content that is missing that they will push through in future as part of future updatesthey are scam artists that probably bribed Park Geunhye and thats the only reason they were never brought to courtGame play ✰✰✰✰Yes very easy to DM a moderator when I am BANNED from the discord and unable to view itafter playing the game for nearly 1 hours there are a few more issues I have come across The Star seed scammers I dont think I need to say anything else this is a massive issue for the game and new players instantly get the chat spammed and there is no hope to ask for help Another issue is the bag space Consumables such as gold boost and pve SXP boosts should not take up inventory space especially when there is a plethora of random uncommon and rare crafting materials This bag space issue is making people think that the game is p2w which isnt a good image for a game with a hurt reputation already Now if you say something about the chests found around the world i have already collected 2 of them and only have 112 slots so that argument doesnt trackPlease listen to the community Dont let this become just like Bless Onlinesay like gathering titles instead of just having the trials and the 2 or so unimpressive titles out right now I want to have a sense of accomplishment and some bragging rights for my achievements in the gameAfter level 3 its forced PvP only There is a toggle where YOU cant PvPexcept others can still PvP you Except you can pay 2 dollars an hour to have PvP be offpayingtohavenoPvPHAHAHAHAnothing serious The world is massive zones in this game are crowded and small so PvP is extremely rare to begin withIve been waiting for some time for this game to release on PC and get a chance to give it a gobeing starved for MMOs for quite some time Having no prior Bless game related knowledge and didnt read about anything related to the game to keep it fresh when it launches I played it until I realized I am not getting enjoyment in its current statethe UI is a mess to navigate or useterrible user experience browsing the menus The game runs fine on my high end rig and looks nicebut the controls are attrociousbut they are objectively useless as well You quickly unlock decent decent gear but it requires you to defeat world bosses or elite enemies for the materials You need 1 material per craftthe item is not 1 drop chance i had to defeat 6 elites to get a damn material from the grassland ogrefights are long and sometimes the respawn timer iis attrocious You can use Z to swap channels and find a zone that has it spawnedkill itget  useful loot and repeat All of this in my attempt to reach crafting level 5 to make some decent armors or weapons Of courseyou can craft the lowest tier item for xp which doesnt need boss itemsbut the gathering is also plagued by low drop chances Its pretty clear it was made as an awful grind  just ignore it altogetheryou get better rewards from following the main quest or grind the 2p5p dungeons The effort and time that is to be spent on crafting simply doesnt cover the leveling speedorestrees are plentiful Skinscloths nope They are dropsabout 16 drop rate per mob on average Same as boss materials Rare materials are even rarer of course Now I wouldnt mind working for my crafting skillupsbut after 3 minutes of extensive gathering for skins and cloths I managed to create 3 items Because you need 1 per craft That means either gather 1 nodes 1 per node or kill 5 mobs For just 1 item that is almost worthlessjust to grind that skill up a bitwhich you can buy from the shopdaily exchange gold  star seed with a very low cap but it gets higher for higher level characters This currency is used at the auction house  market to buy from other players or for selling items you can get this one So with a few hundred bucks youll be able to fully deck a character later down the linethen complain there is no contentno ability queuingvery long animations in general All 3 of them together combined go captain planet result in combat that looks good but feels clunky I played Rangerwhich is a very good overall classbut the amount of times dodgingpressing V to full charge attackstrying to chug a potion or cast an AoE skill and not registeringeven though it felt natural in the flow of combat to be able to do these actionsis high Or the amount of times I fire 12 extra shots after the mob is already dead  same high You have to wait between 1 or 2 seconds between attacks to properly play Not reactive enough for my taste and it feels super slowbut quickly becomes itemhell You can loot treasure chests in the worldthen redeem for 1 bag space I love this mechanicbut the amount of items you get once you pass level 1 keeps exploding Repeateble quest items for reputationmaterials for all craftingitems for the blessings of all other classespotions5 types of foodaugment runesand the list goes on It looks like you wont be able to fully enjoy the game without buying some item slots of going multi account The warehouse bank storage is abysmal You cant craft or turn in quest items with said items in the bank Just one word hell to manageencounters are engagingloot at the end soso If you want a weapon because its an upgradeprepare to do some runs many depending on your luck For me it was easier to grind bosses and materials and craft myself the upgrades  and I didnt enjoy it I felt tired after finally getting decent weaponsnot excitedotherwise you are getting left outlet me segregate it into 2 partspure PvE Lots of activitiesresetting questselitesraid bosses The map is constantly overflowing with activity I felt like in RIFTwhere every zone had something for me to do 247 and I love it Howeveryou dont scale down in terms of power or rewardsso level 5 world bosses quickly become worth  interest for you as a high level RIFT solved that through scaling and everyone could get decent rewards for their current progression by using currenicesbut herenope You can go back and help the newbiesbut you wont be getting much in returnjust funbut after 1 killsthat dissipates as wellbut it gets expensive FAAAST If you dont like getting ganked and are a PvE carebearyou wont have a great time If you like PvPing and or being a jerk in generalyou will have fun until everybody quits Standard Open world PvP with mandatory flaggingwith some famenotoriety basic system that doesnt do that muchpackslimited dealscosmetics which are out of the fantasy world and plenty of gacha that dont even give you stuff you are interested in As a RangerI got blessing soul fragments for all other classes BUT ranger I stopped after 5 draws The store in general pollutes your inventory with  coupons I feel like I am going to Wallmart with a deck of 7 coupons that dont stack Its not even accessible You wont get many places with casual spending Its made for cashgrabs  whales targets and for people who are almost 247 online Standard f2p mobile game mechanicsit has them allshould you get itit has contentyou can easily burn 26 hours until the points form above start to kick in your teeth sooner or laterdepends on your personalityexpecting to have a good time at endgame and have fun along the way playing the multitude of game systems and classes Then NOtaking into consideration the bullet points aboveit will feel very painful3922 hoursblock my account without giving any reasonbut all blood diamonds and VIP points were clearedI never use plugin programsBut I was blocked for the first time because of the suspected black gold problembut there is no anti plugin technologythey despise recharge users and ban their accounts at willthe props on the shelves of the exchange can not be designated to sell to someoneand the seller doesnt know who the buyer is If my props are bought with black goldits ridiculous to blame methey believe that the transfer of props is legal Howeverwhich account associated with me is still illegalso why does my account become legalthe game process has fallen behind a lotand I lost the motivation to continue playingstrikeAfter 7 hours of the gameI cant really recommend Bless Unleashed in the current stage that I am playing itsadly they still know how to fuck things upstrikeI will give this game a full review with information before I leaveand that week was the time I enjoyed it most I didnt know anything muchjust continue my main quests and side quests as a Crusader class The combat system was interesting the first time I playedand I kept enjoying on and on until the main quest end This is the time where youll start seeing the whole picture of the gameclasses and blessings are extremely unbalanced Some people from the player base will disagree with mebut trust methis is a real issue in the game For blessingsnot so muchbut for classes being unbalanced create barriers between classes in the game You have to understand firstthat this MMORPG game is very damageheavy type of game This means the more damage you can dealthe more useful you are This make all highdamage classes demanding When players are doing dungeonsone of the best meta you can put in a teamis four rangers and one priest Youll deal so much damage it doesnt matter what mechanics the boss haditll die before anything happen Classes like Crusader become useless because its the lowest damage class in the gameand even though Berserker can deal a lot of damageits sluggish and play too close to the boss to dish out as much damage as ranger or mage Priest is an exception because its priestyou put a debuff on the boss that let those damage dealer heal from their damage and cast shields so the damage dealing class doesnt diebreathuse to upgrade blessings are getting expensive already and the currency in the game is hard to earnthe developers made it worst Breaths are one of the essential for you to level up your blessings in the game and the price starts increasing when the player base drops This isnt too much of a problemuntil the latest patch that I played bThey killed failstackingb You seefailstacking is one of the most important elements for player whos upgrading their gears and if they fail and break their itemits gonna cost them to buy repair kits to fix it Especially for higher grade itemthese repair kits can start costing a fortune if youre not the top 2 of the player base who is already rich af Now that they removed failstackingwhich can put your gear sucess rate from 5 to 35 if you know how to failstack correctly You cant do it anymorethat means you have to start upgrading your gear from 5 and up if you have a Mythic gear You have to starts buying success rate items and prepare a lot of repair kits to fix your item after it breaks The price of enchanting is so expensive that its harder for every player after this patch to enchant their gears now Some people can see this as a money grab from the developers because maybe they want the players to spend more money on the gamebut I cant be sure about it thoughI dont believe that the developers of this game know what they are doing This point is concluded from my two previous points The balancing of classes is extremely slowand its not on point You seesome class and blessings are so weak and unusable that requires changing and tweaking They btriedb fixing it but it was not on point at all If I get into detailthings will get too complicated Ill just say thatthe weakest is still weakest and the strongest gets stronger Im not saying anything more about failstackingthe developers just trashed itgame is unbalanceddevelopers doesnt fix the problem correctlyitems and upgrading ingame is only for top players because its expensive I dont think this game can survive longso I stopped playing now and I DONT RECOMMEND THIS GAME AT ALL Thank you for readingbut I kept playing because I still expect the developers to improve their game overtime since I played around release and if it did improveI would change this review into a positive or sothat didnt happened though I revised this review when I had 943 hours when I quit and Im not going back to the game again because the developers has proven me that they dont know how to improve the game quality through patches That is when I decided to stop playing and no longer put anymore hours into the gameh1bWALLET UNLEASHEDbh1Wallet Unleashed is an MMO stemming from Korean roots If youre a regular of the MMO genre over the past decadeor even two decadesyoull know the level of expertise Korean MMO Developers have in draining the players wallets The first several hours you play Wallet Unleashed can be extremely funor just incredibly boring depending on who you ask By the time you reach the later stages of the gameyou start to realize just how much Star Seeds which are the pseudo cash currency are necessary to really do anything You can earn star seedsyou can buy star seeds from the Lumena shopbut basically everything requires star seeds at some point Like most KRMMOsyou either grind 32 hours a dayor spend thousands of dollars to get anywhere With that prefacedlet the review beginor slower speed to make it seem like it has more impactexcept it just doesnt have the same feeling as landingsaya parryor a True Charge Slash on Greatsword The games combat is weighty for all the wrong reasonsbut at least the monsters attack slowlyand are very predictableat least with their strong attackswhich makes sense It doesnt matter if you have 3 HPor 5 HP and 85 damage reduction to enemies of the same level if they can just look in your general direction and delete you On the bright sidesaid attacks are easy to predict and equally easy to dodgebut if youre not on top of the ball gameyoure probably gonna get clipped and die anywayWallet Unleashed has some serious antiplayer progression If you want to get anywhereespecially free to playyou have to do everythingeveryday Do regional quests everydaywin in pvp 5 times a dayhave multiple characters at 3 to maximize star seed gainetc Even thenyou will not compare to the power of the wallet Ive spent a few hundred dollarsfor better or worseand its still hard to compete against those who have spent thousands moreor just RMTed You have to have spectacular gear to do endgame contentor else you fail DPS checksand in PVPif your gear isnt allyoure barely going to hurt anyoneand theyll just delete you in a single hit If youre a free playerits even worse To sell any meaningful drops that would otherwise net you 1k1m Star Seedsyou need to spend money It only costs 5 Cents5 to purchase an unbind scrollbut if someone is playing 1 freethen it really hampers the marketthe fact that probably 95 of the playerbase cant even sell the gear they loot makes it incredibly difficult to get the best possible rollsand the best possible runes unless youre really luckyattacksor vistas make me go Wowthis looks fantastic Im not one to be picky about graphicsbut the games got the same visuals as a highend PS2 game Alsodepending on where you gothe towns and the textures are just slapped on youll see lazily pasted texturesand lazily pasted models everywherein places easily accessible This is the first MMO ive ever played where there have been so much lazily copypasted assets sprawled out everywhere Not even games as trashy assayRevelation Onlineor even Mabinogi had a lack ofphysical world building on the level of Wallet Unleashedthe sound effects are terribleand the voices are just bad Aside from Closers Onlinethis is the only MMO where ive played with the BGM on muteand the master volume at 5and just played something else This is the kind of game where youll want to find a 11 hour track of your favorite song on youtubeand play that biON REPEATib throughout the boring grindbecause this games soundtrack is an absolute snoozer nothing like Mabinogior especially Final Fantasy XIV Even Phantasy Star Online 2 New Genesis boring soundtrack is better than this games lack ofsoundtrackand I knew that my stigma would win out at the end Despite thatI gave Bless a fair shotand for what its worthI enjoyed the first 3 or so levels of it After you get to 3where the soulless grind beginsthats when Bless Unleashed starts to show its true colors as a KRMMOand I did spend a good amount of hours on itbut the time I spent on the game does not justify the total net loss of time and money that went into itlike Fallout 76or even grinded a few hundred million gil on FFXIVbut anyone who has played a ton of MMOs over the past decade would know what im talking aboutgive it a try if you wantbut well the end result isthis game is a hard pass for anyone but the richest of whalesh1moneyand sanitythis is just the New World waiting roomlike the 7 other times it has before this iterationSAME KRDEVELOPED ROOTSHorrible optimized instance based with inshop items that literally boosts your characters stats to give you the upper hand I am not kidding You can literally buy attack speed potions in the store Further more it seems like its forced PvP and guess what In order to opt out of PvP you can buy potions in the store that makes you none targetable for PvP for one hour And to top it offyou can buy storage expansions Horrible ingame shophorrible otimazationhorrible instance based mechanicshorrible game Stay as far away from this as possibleI disliked that I didnt receive the currency I purchased to add an extra character slot you only get 3 When seeking a refundthe blessunleashedpc page refers me to Steam The Steam support page refers me to the blessunleashedpc support page Both companies got paidbut neither wants to take responsibility Its only 25 but its annoying I think Im more annoyed at the time Ive spent finding dead ends than I am about the money to be honestNew World waiting roomThe devs are continioustly punishing every players because of Hacker issueReligiousHateful talk in the chatthey punish everyone Instead of hardware banning the Starseeds In game curency used at auction house sellersthey nerf the chat making super hard to explain anything properly to new players asking questionsi stopped this game after 3h 3 weeks of playtimeLove the gamethe mechanicsthe teamwork when it comes to fighting Bosses I played this more than my other favorite games and really wanted to put money into it  then I found out PVP is mandatory You can BUY a 1 hour noPVP couponotherwise anyone can attack you at any level and after youre level 25 theres no way to avoid it Give me a better choice Until thenIm off to put my money into other games If youre into PVPits going to be a good gameThe Backstory of Bless UnleashedYour valuable time is better spent elsewhereThis game is fun  for the first 12 levels of the experience Then you wake up from all the flashy gameplay to grapple with issues ranging from an intentionally flawed player inventory system all the way to an incredibly lopsided game economy that is excessively slanted in favour of players that started the earliestplayer even has the ability to teleport incombat so you can seamlessly jump from one objective or boss to anotherespecially for the ingame marketplaceauction househow does a modern day MMO not have at least a search bar implemented for the auction house Such a travesty is unthinkable in this day and agebecause they missed the tiny window of opportunity to sell lvl 18 epic item bases for millions of starseedswhich snowballs into not just gear level issuesbut also not being able to afford inventory expansionswhich I will cover more lateror they basically cannot play the merchant side of the game theres such a huge bloat in the variety of crafting materialsthat if you do not purchase any inventory slots before your 7 day premium trial expiresyour account isfor all intents and purposesbricked Ohand theres also an annoying bug that if you accidentally pick up quest items after completing a questsaid quest items are stuck in your inventory FOREVER You cant delete themor use them in some mannerand they take up inventory slotsif you were lucky like megot to lvl 3 really quickly and farmed high level time dungeons to sell high level epic item bases for millions of starseedsyou get to somewhat enjoy the game Otherwisejust stay away from this cash grabnot worth the pain having to start this game late
1,Worst story in the seriesand best gameplay in the serieswish i could give it a neutral reviewGameplay B3  Bpay your employees randy7510you will like this game The movementthe gunsand the environments are awesome The gameplay is so good it almost makes up for the shortcomingsof which there are many Seriouslythe gunplay is absolutely fantasticguns are fantastic I always loved finding new gunsshieldsrelicsetchowever there is also a CON here that I will get into laterand the amount of customization to the skills and abilities is AMAZING This is easily the most fleshed out skill system in the series and really made me feel that every point matteredwho thought that was a good idea Almost half the bosses have stages where they sit there and charge up or whateverand are immune to damage for sometimes up to a full minute in the middle of the battle Very annoying and really breaks the fast paced boss fightsthe characters were the absolutely best thing about the game So many memorable peoplelinesand moments In this game there are so few that only one comes to mind while writing this review No Mr TorgueWellother than a slaughter minigameLilith is a waste in this gameMordecaiBrick are almost nonexistentno AxtonGaigeKriegOther than his voiceor SalvadorMaya is relegated to a plot pointand for some reason Hammerlock is now a whiny baby and not a fearless explorer If you are looking for another amazing villain like Handsome Jackprepare to be disappointed And that leads us into point 3its not that baduntil they seemed to abandon the plot they had been foreshadowing The main villains are incredibly annoyingbut then things start to change just before the halfway point of the game and they actually become a little interesting There is conflict and it seemed like the story was going to take a really interesting directionand then they abandoned it The last third of the game is a bit of a slog but it would have been better had they gone a different route for the final boss Overallmediocre villains at bestand other than Promethea the planet stories were kinda boring or uselesswhich is the core of any lootershooterbut it was really disappointing to not get another good story By the end of Borderlands I felt very attached the characters and I wanted to kill Handsome Jack so badly I stayed up late at night just to beat the game I honestly dont even feel like I want to go back through the story againexcept for Promethea I got it on sale at 50 offwhich I would definitely recommend This is not a game I would pay full price for It may seem like I am really ragging on the gamewhich is fairbut I also think it had a ton to live up to after the fantastic game that was Borderlands  When dialogue comes upI role my eyes and shake my headbut the rest of the time Im slidingmantlingslammingshootingand stabbing my way through hordes of enemieswhich is so much fun I forget about the bad stuffthe story is ass but the rest is fun lolThe weapons feel better than Borderlands but replayability is hurt by the weak story and villainsI want to give this game a negative reviewbut I cant Dont get me wrongits a good game Gameplay is great and in most ways its a step up from borderlands  Visuals are awesomeand diversity in locations sure adds to itI have a lot of mixed feelings about this gameso I am going to start withfucking excellentskills and passives All pretty darn good some issues with end game but thats for latercontroversial I know but I like them They are all pretty cool Shame they are shafted by awful writingframe rate except for menus for some reason is nice and clean and for the most part the enemy AI seems goodwhile there are some questions about drops and what not most of the guns from green quality to legendary feel pretty good to usea nice portion of the same tastelessbaselinefoul and ridiculous humour the franchise is loved for This one will be returning in the bad thoughit felt like I was playing an upgraded version of Borderlands  which is rather what I was hoping for from the main campaignand in many places your actions within it seem to be of no consequencethey utterly dreadful at living up to the legacy of the lovinglyhateable Handsome Jack Their story as you learn it at the end of the game has no relatability as their upbringing was no justification in any way for their actions or transformation to monsters You have no empathy for them because their motivations are so weak and attitudes too despicablejust oofobnoxiousMary Sueshitty self insert Whoever this character is based off at GearboxT and which ever moron on the writing staff decided that she would replace a certain favourite character Fire them both please Preferably out of a man cannon at the circus They are clownsguns are goodGraphics are good DLC are goodreally really bad Certain characters are bad Lot of bad voice acting and animationId pay 10 euros for a DLC in which you can kill AvaI waited for the Steam releaseso this is a fresh take With about 100 hours in BL1 and 700 in BLI think this one falls somewhere between the two in terms of qualitywhere once I was solely condemned to using them until I could afford a DPUH  Grog Rarity also seems to have been given a boost not only do legendaries drop at a more generous ratebut purples are also noticeably better than common stockwhere they used to inspire the thoughtawwwhy didnt RNG just give me an orange insteadwith many attempts at jokes falling flat and the reprised characters in general coming across as imitations of themselves rather than the real deal While many lay most of the cringe at the feet of the main villainsI actually find them passable We were never going to get another Handsome Jackand the cringy dbaggery they embody is at least intentional and selfaware All in allit is clear that gameplay mechanics were given the lions share of the energywith the writing as an afterthought This was BL1s approachso its only a letdown in comparison to the awesome balance struck by BLI had to turn my mouse sensitivity up to consistently land shotsmobs are way more dangerous than bossesand to fans of the franchise will probably merit at least 100 hours Unfortunatelyone doubts it will enjoy the lifespan of BLdue to the fact that its story and thus replays are not as endearingI actively play this game with my father who enjoys shotguns The creativity of the different shotguns he can experience and the feel of the weapon have lead him to this summary review pretty good game for 0 bucks which is a level above his satisfactory review of its okay when it comes to reviewing entertainment of any kind gamesmoviesTVI deeply enjoy the perpetual escort mission that is leading my father to where the danger is and routinely reviving him because he has not figured out how to move and shoot simultaneously To addthe ability to ping the map to call for him like a dog has immensely improved my the efficiency of my communication skills while also helping him see key items and weapons for him to consider he suffers from progressive ophthalmoplegiaI would rate this game as fairly difficult due to the necessity of needing to constantly revive him throughout fightsthus massively increasing the longevity and engagement with this gameI would rate this game fairly enjoyable in spending time with my father who is nearing retirementlearning how to play video games and seldom physically visit due to COVID and our geo locations US to EUThe dialogue writing is literally 01 tumblr quality but the game itself is one of the best I have ever playedBorderlands 3 really builds off of what made Borderlands  a good gamehowever this time around most of the content in the game is hidden behind paywalls The game is full of sleazy ways to get you to spend money For examplethe game goes as far as to constantly send you reminder messages to play certain DLCseven if you do not own them with no way of disabling these messageswhich was a major mistake By the way its advertised you would assume you would be able to access all the content the game has to offer After allincluded in the bundle is a Season Pass which gives you access to a bunch of DLCsI found out that I cant even play some of them because THERES A WHOLE OTHER SECOND SEASON PASS YOU HAVE TO BUY FOR 30 TO ACCESS THEM ON TOP OF THE 10 I ALREADY PAID FOR THE ULTIMATE EDITIONh1Borderlands 3 is a good gameruined by the greed of K and Pitchfordh1FAR MORE than I did with any other Borderlands game I adored both the shooting and RPG elements of BL3I think its the best in the series I get what I want in Borderlands the most in BL3fun and insane guns The close range explosive Flakkerthe laser pistol Lightshowthe slot machine integrated gun Lucky 7and the gun that shoots fucking burgers are all inventions of madmen and I love them The playable characters are also the best in the series Multiple action skills allow for you to have 4 BL characters in a single BL3 Vault Hunter Theres no real generic gun man like AxtonRolandand Wilhelm and all of them can be played in unique methods Endgame is also significantly better than BLsas Mayhem levels dont require an hour long investment and all of them are free to you in an instant A final note that a lot of people are sleeping onyou only have to do a single playthrough per character to experience all the content in the game Honestly dread starting new characters in Borderlands because a max level character entails visiting Sawtooth Cauldron 3 timesthe minimaps are an actual challenge to navigate due to how they factor in different floor levels and how they constantly rotate The same minimap will look drastically different from itself if you just move up a staircase and face the other way Alsoit is not my expertise to say whybut BL3 has terrible optimization and even the highest end pcs will experience stutters over very little But the most offending factor of BL3 would be the games writing The main story has some of the worst writing Ive seen in a AAA game Ava is probably one of my least favorite characters from this decade She is a literal child that constantly whines and learns nothingbut for some reason gets the keys to the Crimson Raiders thrown her way And dont even get me started on the Calypso twins Living up to Handsome Jack is a very difficult taskbut they were miles away from ever achieving that Tyreens motivations are the generic I want power for the sake of it villain trope and Troy exists for a buildup to nothing If you want a more detailed explanation on the faults of BL3s storyI highly recommend Cartoonshis video on the topicbut rather the greedy executives as Gearbox devs never received their promised bonuses after the game sold 5 million copies This combined with the allegations of assault and severe underpay from the former Claptrap voice actor really lead me to believe that Gearbox is a talented studio held back by their moneygrubbing publishers I genuinely hope Gearbox will be able to stand without K somedayits a very fun game with some flaws in UIoptimizationand writing But I find the toxic work environment of Kunderpaying of employeesand the anticonsumer business practices make it very hard for me to recommend anyone to get it K is a company up there with EA with their abuse and greed and I hope that less people support themWant to change game language right click on Bonderlands 3  Properties  Set Launch OptionDear BorderlandsBungusjust turn the dialogue off and youll have funSo i preordered Super

Borderlands game seriesmore enemiesmore Borderlands The core gunplay mechanics have been improvedespecially in regards of weapon design and build diversity And rememberif it took more than one shotyou werent using a Jakobsand blow them up The different worlds you can visit add some fresh breath into the adventurous life of a vault hunter It feels like a Schnitzeljagd on a galactic scalehigh quality content My favourite one is GunsLoveand Tentacles it has a solid lovecraftian foundation with a bit of a twistI am happy to see that most of the side characters from the previous instalments have been included into this game On the other handthey are criminally underusedand a certain teenage girlfor her unholy name shall not be mentionedshould have never made it looks at the Interplanetary Ninja Assassin Claptrap I have a job for youI have amassed such a quantity of themall the blingbling on me blinds my enemies In additiona rap label has offered me a recording contractbecause it breaks the fluidity of combatand diminishes the level of difficulty If not for this mechanismI would have melted the face of the final boss within five secondsand at this point I am too afraid to ask Butthe amateurish execution and presentation of the narrative in combination with the insufferable depiction of both main villains speak for excessive drug abuse and  or an overdose of social mediaand I like that it remains true to its core gameplay in form of shoot it  let the loot rain from the heavensI consider the main storyline a train wreckand the attempt of a social parody a failed experiment
1,Wtf does Techland think they are doing Did they miss the memo You arent supposed to release a fully fleshed outwell optimized game on day one You have to fund lackluster development with PreAlpha exclusive monetization and drip feed players the content As if that wasnt bad enoughthey decide to remain closely involved with the communityreleasing updates regularlyeven while developing another game These guys are killing the established order of things How are developers supposed to keep up Whatare they expected to just make games Thats like giving away moneyI couldnt be more proud of these guysLemme give it to yall straightwho are on the fencethe game is very much worth it at full pricethat has kept me up until 5 AM in the morningbecause of how lost I get myself into itsave for a VERY FEW TIMESand each one countedso long as you do enjoy it with actionso I can runacross roof topsand attacking zombies while talking to friendsslightly saferand adds a lot in the form of friendly rivals Single player feels way more tense and everything you do countsmaking you second guess some choicesfor fear or death Night time in either mode is fun as heckthough four coop makes it pretty easyzombies shuffle aroundfalling off rooftopsbeing dumbeasy to avoid and kill Night time Get those UV Flares readyand be ready to flee if they catch sight of youI keep coming back for moreas its super funwhich also included only HALF of the side missions Still got a little over 50 left to goand looking forward to itfind friends to play withenjoy the hell out of one of the few games worth it at full priceGlad to see the misinformed reviews have been thrown out of from the top page For those who have said that Dying Lights daynight mechanic is not what they thought and that time doesnt actually change in the game clearly havent played past the intro missions The first two missions are obviously there to get you startedso theyre not going to thrust a timed daynight cycle before you get the hang of the environment and the mechanicsand thus in the intro missionstime does not change if you dont progress the quest Past those two missionsdaynight becomes very realand incredibly terrifying endRantbut this is what Dead Island should have been Everything from the parkour to the combat just feels incredibly fluid Running around is great funand jumping into abandoned houses and exploringfinding loot is constantly fun And this is where I got caught in my first night phase I was running towards my objective when oh look another shelterlet me go secure it then oh look theres an air drop nearbylet me go grab it then again another shelter nearbyon top of random houses and zombies sorrybiters to lootand before I knew itI got my last radio call telling me I should get to a shelter quick mind youthe Tower warns runners a few times before nightfall to get homebut I just have to keep scrounging for loot I checked my map and realized I was pretty damn far from the closest shelterso I just booked it This is where freerunning gets exciting With how seemless and smooth it is to run aroundthrough buildings and across rooftopsthe run to my shelter didnt feel annoying or like a chorebut more like a challenge to find the smoothest route very similar to Mirrors Edge Long story shortnight fellI shat my pants and crouched my way from rooftop to rooftoplistening to the horrifying screams of the nighttime biters as I eased my way into my little shelter Ive since tried to go out at night and see if I can tackle a nighttime bonus objective of a questand I can tell youas of right nowI am definitely not prepared but Im damn excited to finally face the challengeseemless parkourin my opinionis laughably badbut I began to think that it may have been intentional And Rahim he must have played a lot of Jak and Daxter back in the dayall he needs to do is dye his hair yellow BreckenJade and Lena are among my favorite so farwith Lena reminding me a lot of Cassandra from DAInquisition with her hair and accent Overallcharacters are decentand thats all that really needs to be saidso far at leastand surprisingly undemanding even on my single GTX 970 with everything cranked to max and at 1920x1080 Though many report a huge framerate difference by changing the View Distance optionI can barely see much of a difference ingame with that option set to half or max The only issue Ive noticed is that very very rarelywhen youre fighting biters with melee weaponsthe game randomly hitchesthen continues normally It only happens in combatbut not often enough to be annoying and that might just be my system Overalleverything looks greatand the graphics and effects are wonderful For an ugly gamethe visuals are surprisingly beautifulbut my only comment is that the music that plays when youre outside has one part where a random singer begins to chantand I swear it scares the crap out of me every time Bashing biters with blunt weapons sounds very satisfyingand you can tell when youve hit the right spotwhile hitting the chest is usually a muffled thump Ive yet to get a gun though Ive spent a lot of time just wandering around so Im not too far into the campaign so I cant comment on that Alsomake a little bit more noise and youll hear bonechilling screams in the distance of the more agile biters coming to get you Very satisfying sound work overallyoull like this game If you hated Dead Islandyoull like this game If youre a fan of first personopenworld gamesthen Id bet youll like this gameIve never been one for zombie games but this game changed my mind  Below is a review of the singleplayer campaign I dont play multiplayer so cant comment on these elements  Hope it helps you firstperson action and RPG where the citizens of Harran a fictional place in Turkey are becoming infected with a rabiesrelated virus  Your task as protagonist Kyle Crane is to locate research regarding a cure on behalf of the Global Relief Effort  You join a garrisoned band of survivors in Harran and take on the role of one of their runners people who carry out the dangerous work of gathering supplies and carrying out other requests on behalf of survivors as a guise while you try to infiltrate and locate a wanted man and some vital dataopenworld environments are incredible  set in the slums of Harran and later Old Town  both locations offering a different style of parkour  Your movement will be a mix of runningjumpingusing a grapple hook or sliding down cables  Ohand the odd swim  The parkour is fluideasy and not overfantasised it is not beyond imagining that a fit and strong man could perform the moves the game offers  The campaign itself is of good length and enjoyableand there is a wealth of optional side missions and challenges to completethe infected and virals roam the streets aimlessly often in huge numbers but dont present too much of a danger provided you keep to rooftops and higher areas  At night thougheverything becomes much more sinister  Not only are the infected out in greater numberbut a darkeralmost indestructable breed of the infected comes out for the hunt  Theyre stronger than youfaster than youand would like dinner with you you as the main course  There is no other recourse but to stay indoors and sleep until daybreakor dare to go out and use stealth and speed as best you can  Its worth it because youll get double experience pointsbut you might not last too long  You have been warnedagility and power Youll earn upgrades by gathering experience points in each of these three areas  The weapon system is wonderful  At firstyou have nothing but bits of woodtable legsthe odd wrench here and there  with which to pummel the infected until they die  But as your survivor experience points ramp upso does the quality and power of  the available weapons and it wont be long before youre oneshotkilling the bulk of infected people  Weapons can be upgraded with enhancements and buffs as you collect thembut they dont last forever  You can repair a wornout weapon only so many times before you must find or buy another in Harrana HARD mode has been added  Good luck with that  For the rest of usI would say the difficulty is at medium level when playing on normal  Youll be in for some fights and reliance on parkour from the startbut nothing feels unachievable  There will be enemies that at first will be too tough to confront headonbut nothing is beyond reach    At firstI tended to cling to roof tops and would become easily overwhelmed by the infected if I found myself in the middle of a streetbut I didnt have to wait until too long before I was easily able to defend myself and reap all the resources infected bodies still carry once killed  The only element of the game I didnt enjoy difficultywise was the small number of speed challenges same sort of thing as the speed challenges in Assassins Creed but these are totally optional and nothing is lost for any player who prefers not to complete themI actually found mouse and keyboard much easier for the parkour than my XBox 360 gamepad  Both are supported and hotswitchable but I found KbM more accurate  Overallgameplay felt fluid and funwith very few frustrating moments throughout the gamebut they werent bad either  It took me over 100 hours to complete the gamebut on average I take twice as long as the average gamerso expect at least 50 hours of gameplay  The story was enjoyable without being too predictable a few twists and turns along the way and it has left me wanting to replay the gameI only had problems with one area towards the end where framerates dropped and grass polygons were no longer rendering correctly  Out of 100 hoursthat was about 10 minutes of gameplaybut Im running the game with a 6Gb nvidia Titan Black on a new 6core i7so there is a good chance there will be the same or similar problems on anything less than that caveat I did ramp up every single setting in the game so you might need to dial back some thingsbut franklyno matter what level of settings you useyou will still be impressed by the graphicsI didnt much like the speed challenges as they really didnt fit well with the story and were a tad too difficult for bad gamers like me  Sometimestrap zombies were placed purposely behind closed doors with no chance for the player to take avoiding actionresulting in immediate death death isnt a huge problem youll just lose a chunk of experience points but it felt a bit unnecessary to put these deliberate traps in the game  Finallythere is a big announcement onscreen about being about to embark on the final part of the game its really just to tell you that while the game will end you will still be able to finish off other missions and such  This totally broke the immersion for me I would rather the game just flowed into that final sequence but its a petty thing reallydemonstrating that there really isnt much to dislike about the game at alland even at full price it feels like a bargain Even if youre not struck by zombie gamesif you like a GOOD openworld gameI really recommend it  A huge thankyou to the developers for giving me a fantastic 100 hours of quality entertainmentLike zombies Like popping their heads with gunskatanassledgehammersetcspent an entire night on a pole because i couldnt make it to a safe house 1010This is a great game How often have I not decided to go do this quest a few hours before sundown thinking plenty of time only on the way to the objective I stumble on some other stuff to dolike this dude that wants help retrieving his fishing rod or something Looks at sun sure I can do thatplenty of time still Then only 5 minutes before nightI complete the mission and reallize how close to evil night I am Frantically begin sprinting and parkouring for the nearest safehouse On the way I find a police van practically unguarded Knowing how good the loot can get in these police vans I just gotta open it and get the goodies After all it could be rifle ammoor a new shiny weapon Im usually not more than a minute or so picking the lock Done lootingbut oh shit its almost 2000my watch is beepingnight is coming now A few hundred yeards from the safehouse still its too latemonsters emerges and I need to slow down and try to stealth my way back Jumping over a fence I dump down practically in front of a dreaded volatile Knowing it can rip me to shreds in seconds I flash my ultra violet lamp in its general direction and decide to beeline straight for the safehouse Several horrible grows tearing the silence behind me and action music fills my veins with adrenaline as I sprint for my life From the growls I gather that several volatiles have joined in the hunt Jumping down into a shallow wide crevice with a cracked concret pipe running in the middle I quickly slip into the pipe and crouch down in the corner hoping no one saw me go in The monsters are shambling around on the outside with the distinct sound of them breathing Sounds like air being sucked through shredded meat But I think they dont know where I am Then glorious pursuit evaded message appears Phew I now pay attention to the search cones on the minimap and successfully sneaks back to the towerIm a 67 yrs old grandma who loves playing this game I am not bored any more  Love killing the zombies using different weapons and traps I use to fear the violatileI would run and hide in a safe house as soon as it got dark Now I go looking for them and enjoy killing them I like increasing my levels and crafting my weapons and making them stronger so I can kill the demolishers and other monster I like doing all the quests I like clearing the safe zones I complete the game and go right back inso much fun chopping heads off  Now I understand why when I called my boys to dinner they wouldnt stop playing their video gamesyou really get caught up in the game You always want to finish a quest and the game Cant wair for more Dying light games Im a lone player once in awhile my sons will join my game But for most of the time I am a single playerother players are just too fast for me They run circles around me  I love my games I cant wait for the new one looks awesome   I played the PRISON it was fun It has a glitch when I was about to enter the  outside courtyard the violites were able to kill me by spitting their venom through the hallway concrete wall  I havent been back since  It kept repeating BAD BLOOD GLOBAL PLAYTEST PHASE TWO ON SEPT 1st AT 900 AM YOU HAVE TO SEE THE TRAILER  SO COOL Releasing free content 3 years after release These developers are saint God blessKEEP IN MIND THIS REVIEW IS GOING OVER DYING LIGHTNOT DYING LIGHT THE FOLLOWING AT THIS POINT I WILL UPDATE THIS REVIEW ONCE I GET INTO THE FOLLOWING ALSOI HAVE YET TO COMPLETE THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN WITHIN DYING LIGHT Ok now onto the review for what I think so far but the added features of parkour and freerunningcombined with the large open worldand a fresh feel the often oversaturated zombie genreand there are very few issues with the movement The one only area that doesnt do great in this regard is getting up cliffs or rocky areasbut considering that Dying Light takes place in an urban environmentyou arent gonna be climbing up that many cliffs tbhwhere you find what you need to upgrade a weapon in the worldand then can add a variety of upgrades to melee weapons such as fireelectricitybleedingand toxicity It feels pretty damn cool to get a high end weapon and add flame to itso when you hit a zombie it will burst into flames Guns in this game are relatively easy to come across once you get to a high enough survivor levelhowever its rare enough that its still specialthen you are kind of an unstoppable beastbut at least its not a situation where you get a level and go from really weak to tremendously overpowered For Agilityyou gain points by as you may have guessed running around the mapjumping and leaping from rooftop to rooftop For Poweryou can gain these points from killing zombies and generally doing damage The best part is that you can get points towards this through molotovsor other zombiekilling devices other than your own weapons This is a plus because sometimes you are focusing so much on quests and running around to the point that your agility level is off the chartswhile your power level is likelevel 5 The Survival level is upgraded by completing questscapturing airdropsand saving survivors One thing to keep in mindis if you plan to play with friendsI would HIGHLY reccomend having one save file for yourself and another for you to play ewith your friends I ran into a situation where I was playing by myself and then bringing my friend into that game when he was available This meant that he only got survivor rank credit from the quests that we did togetherand so I was a way higher rank than him Then theres the legendary rankwhich is unlocked after unlocking all the upgrades in every other skill tree It turns you into a zombie killing tankby increasing max healthstaminaas well as specific weapon damage Overallthe upgrades are challenging enough and also provide you with enough reason to try to level up a certain skilland does not seem forced at all It makes it really interesting for parkouras well as when you are running away from a viral or a volatileand also new and original which is great to see in the zombie genre They are superhuman zombies rather ironic choice of words but you ge the idea and they only come out at night This makes any situation where you are stuck outside after the suns gone down really damn intense Dying Light does a great job making you goddamn terrified of the dark The other zombies and special infected are pretty genericbut stillwhat those are lacking forI feel like the volatiles make up for that one hundred percent There are new infected added into Dying Light The Following from what I have seenbut in the base gamethe infected that you encounter in the daytime are pretty damn genericno problems whatsoeverwith lens flare and all other sorts of cinematic effectsyou feel like you are playing a movie sometimes Absolutely gorgeous gamethe average infected you will meet will be more of the same The volatiles I personally believe help change the entirety of the gamebut still overall the zombies are pretty underwhelming and quickly become an inconvienence rather than something scary within the gameand is very predictablewhich makes you quite apathetic towards a lot of people That being saidthere is one guy whos name escapes me that just hangs out beside the elevator in the tower when you ride it up and is likethe nicest dude from the get go I love that manif you are looking for a beautiful game with great mechanics player upgrades that you can sink hours into without realizingDying Light is the game for you Howeverif you are looking for a very storyrich gamethen this will fall short I personally have had a blast with this gameand playing with friends makes the game just that much better I would highly reccomendbut who knowsI may do more Hope you have a fantastic day A week ago I was diagnosed with a terminal illnes and the doctors have given me a year at best Im so glad I was able to play this masterpiece before I go I dont know how many people will see this but I recomend to you to buy this game if you do see it Gameplaygraphicsrealismeffects everything is masterfully crafted Thank you Techland for your gameDying Light is a great gameI could write a really long reviewbut let me just write a list with some pointsif you want you can buy DLC Certain DLC will add a bunch of content againgreat singleplayer experiencethere is a great atmosphere and it is just fantastic howsome great abilities you can earn and the inventory system works niceso there is enough gameplay to be found in this game and it will keep you busy for a long whileyou just get GREAT VALUE for your moneyFirst couple of hours are difficult considering the lack of effective weapons but after that it becomes amazing Campaign is predictable and a bit overdramatic but still entertaining The gameplay is amazing and the parkour system is fun and energetic Base game is amazing but the following dlc makes it godly I bought it on sale and got the enhanced edition for 20 and it was super worth it Truly a good game and deserves more money We need to start supporting good games like this and not trash money grabbers like the newest cod 1210The best Single Player Zombie experience available in my opinionalong with State of Decay 2 Dying Light is more polished though Multiplayer is still quite fun but the Story its where its atchallenging but never frustratingThe Walking Dead by dayI Am Legend by nightbut I will say thisin a very long timewhich has legitamately inspired a sense of fear in methis game becomes a heart pounding nightmareI love this gamethe best zombie and parkour game of all timeplus there are multiplayer features so the game will be more fun If you are looking for a parkour game this might be the solutionthe best zombie and parkour game evercool weaponsa lot of places to exploreclimb everything Its parkour with zombies Go through a city in rooftops Its simply greatbut not the best aroundand I can clearly say that sometimes youll litteraly cry because of laughing so much By farthis was the most funny experience Ive ever had in coop There were tons of funny situations happening You will laughbelieve me A lotTLDRbut the majority of them are the slow braindead typeonly attracted to noise  the kind that can be easily avoided by just simply running a couple feet outside their immediate reach In generalavoiding zombies is the best way to progressquite different from how Far Cry playswhere its more of a taking back the island sort of experience rather than working around the citywhich is what Dying Light excels atyour main methods of dealing with zombies are all finite resourceswhether it be your melee weaponsyour guns ammo is limitedor your special crafted itemssuch as grenades or explosive ninja stars yes how edgy So the game essentially works off of the riskreward mechanism of using your small pool of finite resources to loot materials and new weapons from a city that is under siege from undead The way you be successful is by picking the correct application of your killing tools to loot these items most effectively so that you use less resources than what you lootKyle Cranedefinitely ate his greens growing upas the guy throughout his journey will come to be an expert of parkoursoon enough learning how to freerun effectively and fluently around in the city in a way that is supremely satisfying Know all those cliche People Are Awesome videos from 2010 where its just a guy doing super cool jumps across the tops of buildings Yeahthats you in this gamewhile something like a combat knife is good at quick slashes and wearing down zombies with multiple incisions All of these weapons are animated realistically I mean I think  hell if I know how to fight with a baseball bat or a knifebut it looks realistic enough and they all feel extremely satisfying to swing around and score some kills with And if using a baseball bat to score a homerun on a zombies temporal lobe isnt enough for youtheres a pretty basic but very user friendly crafting system in the game that lets you add a variety of fun and sometimes pretty nasty effects onto your looted weapons A baseball bat that also electrifies zombies Surewhy notGo out at night they saidThe most admirable thing about this game is that the developer Techland four years later is supporting the game with new DLC and events Just like CDPRTechland has proven that there are developers who actually cares about their fanbases and wants to give them the full gaming experience For me that is important for a gameto feel like the developer admire their own products and supports them throughout long periods of timebecause the reward is extra XP that you can use in the skill tree to unlock new and fun skills The zombies are well done and even though some can get annoyingI feel like those are important to make the game more challenging A tip is to play on the hardest difficulty to get the best experience Also the coop is fun and if you have people that you can play withthe experience gets even better Me and my brother has played this game for so long and we are still stuck with iteven though the second one is coming soon this one will always have a place in my heart The story is intriguing and the side quests are funeven though some are a bit silly The voiceacting is for me not a problembut some NPCs could have been voiced a bit better Alsoanother well made part of the game is the weapons and crafting You can make so many different cool things with the weapons and it never gets boring For me this game is a masterpiece and you should not hesitate getting it if you havent already The musicsoundtrack is excitingespecially at nighttime Alsodont forget to nominate this game at the awardsThe Labor of Love is made for these guysYou fire up Dying

1,My dads favorite game Blood cancer took him away I just want to say thanks to Wargaming for giving him his best days in lifeMy grandpas favorite game Testicular cancer took him away I just want to say thanks to Wargaming for giving him his last best days in his lifeFantastic gameruined by a greedy developerjust to make it look pretty But Im just looking at itnot playing it because my tank has been robbedFULLY EQUIPPED and able to go headtohead against any other tank on a level playing field And this is not the only tank Ive spent money on Some players spend hundreds even thousands of  on this game But its genuinely a great game and few of us regretted it untilpaid for in game currency To reequip my tank for peak performance I have to wait for newlyimposed TIMERS to run out which will take MOST OF A MONTH OrI can pay even more REAL MONEY to get it now Dont forget I already paid plenty REAL MONEY for this tank and now theyre asking for morejust to get back what I had alreadywe all do And this update has taken away 1 of our equipment on all tanks and gave us enough compensation in the form of a brand new alternative currency to buy only 12 back Yeswe did the mathand again we did the math It will take ACTUAL YEARS for many players to recover what they ALREADY EARNED but was taken away In extreme casesup to a decadeIve played this game for over 6 years nowand Im finally going to write my FINAL review of this gamethis game used to be very fun but now its just another P2W gamethat your only way of winning is using OP tanks or even going further by using OP tanks in a platoon Like Smasher platoonT22 platoonObj 252U etcyou ofc need to spend a sht load of money to get those tanksit really wasbut now because all this P2W sht it really isnt that much fun anymorenoI would not really recommend this game unless youre willing to spend a lot of money that isI myself am a F2P player and I dont really win that much anymore just because of the trash matchmakerI mean itThis communitycollectivelyhas a lower IQ than bag of rocks644 hours of my life wastedthere is no endgame even if you complete all tech treesbecause they will just keep adding more tanks to keep people in the gamebut the competitive matchmaker and the matchmaker overall dont care about player skillonly for the tank you have So its very easy to get matched with someone that has 34 WR only because he has a shop tank so that the teams would have a relevant amount of diversity in terms of tank typesbut it seems more like milking at this point Ive seen it in many other games and I know what it feels like 9 of the people you will find as your teammates are toddlers and in a game that requires communication to win makes it clear you cant really depend on someone like that who will just go die only because he didnt want to do what you told himhe lacks common sense and so does the community at this pointit may seem like they are having fun but what they had when they first started making videos was gone after a while and was replaced with an advertisement puppet All this of course is nothing but my pure opinion on what this game has becomebecause its the universal truth that free mobile games want to milk your wallet in the end and thats an unhealthy practice at pc gaming I have found a better community than this at a more fun game of which I wont mention because Im not an advertiser If you want a good game and community just look elsewherebecauseYou picked the wrong housefoolWargaming Heywe should put our games on Steam People would like that rightwe want World of Tanks on SteamBefore I startI wish to apologize if I make any grammatical errorsEnglish is not my first languagethis game is a nice fun game to play if you are interested in WW2 and later era tanks or this type of gameplayfor the long versionand there are two gamemodes The first is encounter where the objective is to either eliminate the entire opposing team or capture the base The second is supremacyit is similar to the first gamemodehowever there are multiple bases to captureand capturing one or allwont automatically make you wininstead your team will get points per base captureddestroying an enemy tank will reward you with points and remove points from the enemy Eliminating the entire enemy team is also an option All of this will take time at maximum of seven minutes per gamehowever it is quite rare that a match would last this longAmericaUSSRChinaPanEuropean Multiple European nations in one which will lead to an Italian tankbut more tanks from the previous nations would be added hereJapanGermany and France All of these nations have their own playstyleso make sure you start with the right nation for you When you do select a nationyou will be given a tier one tankyour goal is to move up the tiers to get that sweet shiny tier ten Butto go up the tiersyou need experience to upgrade the tankthen get more experience to get the  next tank How do you get experience By simply playing the game Even if you lose you will still get somebur far less than if you winis very intense You only have a certain amount of hitpointsand once you lost someyou can not get them backand dying means game over for youand back to the garage What makes the action intense is that skill is at play And luck too There are tactics to be usedlike hulldown and sidescraping to throw off your enemy and make their shells bounce of your armor These thing you will learn in due timeit is not as hard as people make it out to beall you need is the right tankand timenimbledeadly and no armortheir job is to spot the enemyflank and help out their teammates who are in a sticky situation thanks to their speed Howeverthey have no armorand one HE shella shell that has a hard time penetrating but when it does it deals much more damage than normal ammo and a huge chunk of your health is gone So play smartand be effectiveone of the hardest tanks to master since you need knowledge on everything There are mediums tanks with less armorweaker guns and better speedor viseversaheavy and slow As the name suggestthese are the heavies of fpss Their job is to soak up the damage with their large hitpoints and return the love with their big guns Howeverthey are quite slowso they easily fall victim to circle of deathsso make sure you are never alonetank destroyers TD for short Usually turretlessbut have great guns Turretless TDs have very restricted movement so they are best at the back of the team since they are very easy to get behind and delete themhowever they make up for it for their great gun which can pack a lovely punch There are currently 2 lines which have a turretand one differs from lightly armored to heavily armoredwhich if you follow the instructionsyou will get rewardsand sometimes if you are luckyeven a premium tankand keep in mind this is originally a mobile phone gameso the graphics can not be all that greatbut with some updatesthey are trying to make the game look nicer This is a plus for mesince the game actually looks niceand if you have any deviceyou can guarantee that you will run itI can safely say that most tanks are historically correct Currently from the hundreds of tankswhich are not fictionalI only found one tank that is not historical Buteven soit is a huge joy to take command of a Tiger 1 or the infamous Mausthere is not a game which is perfectwhich are quite powerfuland some are OP The company also sells loot boxes for a chance to get the rewardwhich people labeled the game as Pay 2 win Look at the price of the gameyeahit is a free gameso how would they make money if they did not make appealing offers Some tanks are powerfulbut there is not a tank that does not have a weakness And besidesall the tanks which you can get for freeare powerful and fun in their own respective way You can play the game without spending a dimebut at the cost of taking a while to move up the tiersI think this game is a great game and fun at that The community takes the game too seriously which does make it less enjoyablebut simply turning off the chat helps If you are interested in tanks and have a low end deviceinstall the gameit is small so it does not use up a lot of space If you are not interested in tanks but what I mentioned here sound appealingdo not be afraid to give it a trylike I had saidit is freeso you would be losing nothingthis is my first timeso I apologize if I had done any mistakesThis game used to be fun until it wasnt Developers care only and only about the money they make so no balancing or any realy work is done in the game Tier 7 is basically ruined if you want to work on your tech tree tanksits filled with OP pay to win vehicles and the worst part is developers are fully aware of this and they dont give a single  about iton the contrarythey release more broken tanks in the tier and make lots of money off of it Also the matchmaking is close to nonexistent one day i play 28 matches make 8 winratethe next day out of 14 matches i have 2 winrate Nobody can explain how my performance dropped this much overnightits solely the fault of bad matchmaking Wouldnt recommend to anyone until something is doneUnfortunatelly this game represents new way of gaming Instead of providing you with proper content that keeps you entertained for hours they try to captivate you inside of casino like events and lootboxescreate habits in you via many ingame actions that provide you with various bonuses but only in case you are active daily andor pay some money Game tries to force habits on players so that they return daily This is reinforced by introducing various tanks like Annihilator that are simply much better than the other vehicles speaking from position of Annihilator ownerthere is no middleground for the most part I would really like to see games where players act tactically and help each other but for some reason that does not happen here or very rarely This pattern repeats on several Wargaming gamesbut then fails to entertain you after a whileThis game gets a lot of hate for being a mobile port and not the full WoT experience but having played both I can tell you this is just a different game Theres no artillerythe maps are smalland matches go very quickly because of itarmor thicker in frontangle of attack deflectionsmodule damagesammo rack explosionsand crew damage based on hit locations but in a slim fast paced fun design And never more or less than 7 people per teamOne tip Once you spenda better offer magically appearsWhy dont you just bring the proper World of Tanks to steam huh pim playing a pc port of a mobile port of a pc game on pcFantastic gameruined by a greedy developerjust to make it look pretty But Im just looking at itnot playing it because my tank has been robbedFULLY EQUIPPED and able to go headtohead against any other tank on a level playing field And this is not the only tank Ive spent money on Some players spend hundreds even thousands of  on this game But its genuinely a great game and few of us regretted it untilpaid for in game currency To reequip my tank for peak performance I have to wait for newlyimposed TIMERS to run out which will take MOST OF A MONTH OrI can pay even more REAL MONEY to get it now Dont forget I already paid plenty REAL MONEY for this tank and now theyre asking for morejust to get back what I had alreadywe all do And this update has taken away 1 of our equipment on all tanks and gave us enough compensation in the form of a brand new alternative currency to buy only 12 back Yeswe did the mathand again we did the math It will take ACTUAL YEARS for many players to recover what they ALREADY EARNED but was taken away In extreme casesup to a decadeWith hundreds of hours on mobile and pc combinedthis is my 1 factual review on WOT blitzwould definitely recommend since its free  Developers are constantly coming out with updates and attempt to listen to the communitypeople cry every time they lose calling their team shit and morons most common phraseswhich gives wallet warriors advantages  Its like a typical mobile game where almost anything is possible with enough moneyjust like any other team game  You could get 67k dmg w ace tanker badge and 6 destroyed tanks but your team still losesoften advertising trash containers or tanks as something great  Make sure to do your research on a tank or container before spending money on itWould like to see original World of Tanks on SteamAnd with conclusion of latest eventtime to present to you upgrade it with a 122 gununlock next tank and repeat To do so you NEED premium account Or else youll be playing the longest Farming Sim session youve ever imagined But to get new tanks you also need ingame currency Technicallyyou dont need premium account for thatbut you will need premium tanks to obtain currency fast Seems legit Right Wrongranging from 115 up to a 1 In a mobile game Rightyou go into a battle and oh no Whats that All of your teammates are already deadeven on a potato And though it might run well Servers always have issuesespecially during events Have fun with ping jumping like a squirrelheld once a quarter Why might Wellif youre rarely playing and you have 4 tanksyoure screwed Events not for you Most of the events are for people with 5 tanks and 26 hours freeout of 24 And guess what Some of them you cant finish wo spending real cashagain Latest event required to either live in game for 3 weeks or spend rougly 15 on a chance to win something FantasticMilkplayersdrygaming released tanks with guided missles Youve heard it right In the age of early coldwar tanks you have guided missles There is no protection against them and theyre very strong So strongin factthat match is determined by whos side has more of those tanksretardation and hopelessnessjust bring a pal along Its not as mindnumingly painful to play this game aloneh1uOVERALLu 👍h1its much more than thathere is whythis is really not needed in my opinionthe 7v7 fast pacing games is really what make Blitz uniqueless players means smaller mapswhich means way less campingyou got into the action instantly and you have to play with your skill and knowledge to make the differenceyou dont have to wait in a bush because the situation in your game is not suitatable for you to pushithere is no artillery in this game and this is perfectyou can push without being punished by some stupid clickers Artillery is ruining the whole dynamic of battles in PCwhen you get focused you just have to hide and wait there is really no fun to get hit by something across the map while you are powerlessithis means if you play a T6 tankyou can be matched against T6T7 or  T5T6 tanksgood luck playing T8 against T1this is wongthe matchmaking is completely random and yesyou can have some bad luck and encounter a huge lose streak but most of the time the only thing that make the difference is YOU You have to know when to pushwhen to retreatwhere to aim and you have to learn map awarnessthis is very importantiits a basic mechanic that everyone have in the game regardless of their progression This ability tells you if you have been spotted by showing you a bulb 3 seconds after you got spottedthis is really stupid and mindblowing that Wargaming still not changed this mechanic that everyone should have right at the startthere is some exceptions to it howeverihowever most of the players who drives these tanks are completely garbage at the gameso if you are a relatively good player you wont have a problemit becomes one when good players are playing these types of tanksWargaming are the only ones on the market so this is unfortunately inevitablethey can do what they want unless there is huge complains coming from the communityiyou might think its good but the updates are most of the time balances changes There is 1 new map and 1 or 2 tech tree tanks per year Considering the amount of money they gather with this gamethe content is really lackingWargaming still find some excuses about hardware limitation but I would call it lazynessthere is not enough exciting ways to unlock tanks for free iMy Intel Celeron 35U cant handle the regular WoTbut i can play this shity version of WoT at a decent fps rate So Blitz is the WoT for a gipsy or nigerian guy like myself
1,Do not buy this game until you have looked into what you are getting into Dont buy it based off of streamer hypefriend hype or review hype SCUM is in early access Whether you agree with the concept of early access games is irrelevantmechs are unpredictable at times and your shotgun will shoot through puppets if they’re too closewhat have I spent 15 hours doing in this gamesquadmech or puppet lagged out and killed me This is not PUBGif you want a game where the goal is to get looted and battle it out with other playersthis game is not for youbut not so easy to get that they are a waste You need to plan your engagements You’ve got to be willing to lose your gear if a situation goes south You’ve got to be sure that you are aware of your surroundings so someone doesn’t kill you while you’re busy lootingskinning them and then wearing their hide as a trophyI’m fascinated by the idea of cooking the more complex items I upgrade my throwing skillbecause I’m curious what the next level

other game Ive ever played Aside maybe ACTUAL Fishin simulators Definitely chill and relaxing to just whip out your rod lol and catch some fish Taking a few mins to reel in a lunker Nice lil mini game of sortsThe first time I had one I had to Evac my buddy from Wep Factory in the dead of night I got there and we went to get in Both of us standing on one edge and the friggin thing flipped Likethat lil attention to detail Amazing Scared the Sht out of us We lived Then the storm comeslightning crackingpouring rain Waves smashing the boat What a feeling This game creates stories Adventures MemoriesScumthere are more positives than negativesI know its an early access game and many players are weary of the tag but this game is more than capable in keeping you entertained and busy enough to see past the bugs and glitches some of them being hilariousI give it a solid 851 Well worth the 2There is one thing you MUST know before buying this gameyoull quickly find out that youre not an olympic athlete and probably run out of energy and that guy who only has his fists is going to murder you with them Then hell eat you because he knows proteins and fats are more important than killing randomsis the person youll see on the SCUM reddit or Discord asking why theyre always passing outor why cant they stop defacating everywhereIt was good at first exploring the map and collecting loot until a pattern started happening i would constantly be getting sniped As you may know when you die you lose all your weapons and loot It doesnt matter what i do or how careful i am sneaking around theyd always find meso i done a quick Youtube research to find out Scum is full to the brim of hackers The game is toxic and pretty much unplayableJust to preface this reviewI have bought and played every survival game for the last like 5 years Ive been a server ownermodderand clan owner on a myriad of survival gamesthis game is headed downhill fast And it is not due to a lack of effort on the Devs partthey are doing a great job I think the biggest issue this game has is direction You need to pick right now what kind of game you are going to be This game has all the mechanics and structure to be a great survival gamebut it like all others before it is going down the dark path to being PVP centered You cant stop PVPbut you can design in a way that makes it not break the gameand make all of the other great features irrelevantyou and the other players chop and glitch and disappear entirely And the PVP wouldnt be so bad if you could freely respawn somewheregrab a weapon and get back in the fight But you cant in this game Dying means hours of running and looting just to scrap together enough gear to try again Only to encounter another group of fully geared guys with sniper rifles hittingand Im not joking I can send you the video on this 15m killshots 15m Killshots What kind of survival game needs the ability to make 15m killshots And to add to the frustrationyou have to BUY a respawn So then you are out of fame pointscant do anything but random spawn and frantically loot again as you run AGAIN back to your basethen run AGAIN to a bunker or some high loot areaonly to be killed by some douche that logs off in the bunker and shoots you in the back when he spawns in There is so much broken gameplay with this gameand so many things that contradict each other it is unreal Like the metabolism and levels I never look at thatever There is this huge part of the gameand its a major part in a survival game that hasnt been done like this before But it is rendered completely useless by the fact that people dont live long enough to even worry about it Other than eating or drinking whatever random thing I had on me at the timeI never had a need to look at it any furtherwhere people are trying to scrape up everything around them to survive there is no farming No gathering of wood and stone to build with No building And I know this is on the roadmapbut I think it needs to be made a higher priority The majority of players on the server are solo or small groups that need a place to store their stuffsecurely This lockpicking thing is another issue Whats the point of scrounging all this shit together in a base after spending 1s of fame pointsthat arent exactly easy to come byjust to have your stuff lockpicked by another crew Is that what surviving is about Breaking into your neighbors house to take stuff that you dont even need Like 6 man groups are running around lockpicking everyones houses and taking their guns and ammo They dont need itthey have more than they could ever use And then what is the solo suppose to dostart over at  and spend MORE fame points to board up the same houseor another onejust for it to happen againthey will take it There is no way to lock them upand very few buildings that you can actually store them in And if you doit will cost you hundreds of fame points And even thenit can be easily lockpicked and stolen Or you hit a couple trees with it due to the ridiculous handling and squirrely back endand it blows up Want to take it somewhere Well you canbut when you get out you cant lock it And people will generally follow you and take it Cars should spawn all over the placebroken and in need of repair They should require parts and fuel to run You should have to gather these things up and fix the car to get it on the road It should have keys that you can make for itbut you could take say a shoulder or side of meat and throw it on your back Then when you are back at your camp cut it up Also why is there not just a grill I can make out of metal and place over a fire to cook meat on I can get to the point where I have full military gear and weaponsbut I am still putting meat on sticks to cook itbut at least find a way to balance it Rust has tons of pvpbut you can spawn back in 1 of 1 sleeping bags placed anywhere in the world Dying doesnt cost you anythingand you can have a base that isnt as easily raided to put guns in so you can get back in the fight No looking around for clothes to hold gear inas you have an inventory and everything takes 1 slot They chose the PVP pathand the survival aspect is almost nonexistent If people want to battle royale let them play PUBG That is not why I bought this gameand it is not what was promised when this all startedfishingtrapping gamebuilding a place to call your ownpicking herbsmaking medicinecrafting things that actually have a purpose Survival should mean more than surviving going in to a high loot area and not getting shot by another playerthe drone follows them around for a set amount of time showing their location to everyone or have a humanity system where they get negative humanity for killing another player and then loop something else into that like a bounty system Random respawns should be freebut after 1 make it have like a 5 minute timer so people cant abuse it to travel around the map Take out the high end snipers why why would you need that in a survival game Balance the guns damage and armor rates I got 1 shot full healthfull military gear with a shotgun from 2 feet awaycome on now More hunting gunsless military grade weapons After allin a survival scenario thats what you would find more lying around hunting riflesshotgunsand pistolsand fix the game that you already have  Every itemfeaturetweak you do to the game should be in line with wanting to push the game in a certain direction Right now it seems like the dev team doesnt have a clear end game goal of where they want to beand are just putting in things to try and get people to stay interested in the game with no regard to how it effects the overall gameplay Or if at the end when everything is finishedit will even be the game we all paid our money for Please Please dont be the next Rustor Arma We have those alreadyand they are cancerous PVP games with terrible communities and aggravating play styles Get a clear picture of what the final product is going to beand stick with it Number one because if you are just going to keep going this direction and end up just another PVP gamethen people deserve to know now Dont keep taking peoples money and touting this game as a survival game with all these great survival featuresonly to produce a game that is just another PVP killing fieldand the devs have done an amazing job so far But I think that they need to pick a side and stick with it if they are going to be successful If not then it will turn into another H1Z1Miscreatedor Subsistence Great gamesthat went nowhereI am going to split this review into three parts 1 The good 2 The bad 3 What I think should be changedaddedor bandits Someone to set off my alarms and traps or test my defenseseating nice foodreading a bookcatching your first fishcompleting a big build will make the player happy Things like recent deathdeath to a teammatehungrycoldwet makes player unhappy Happiness affects speed and performance No game has come close to being so realistic Why not go for itor maps to secret entrance to bunkers or tunnelbut would be cool to have an economyin SP have random dead bodies with loot like a crashed carchopping down a tree sometimes you get a birds nest with eggssometimes you get nutsfruittonnes of fooda raftand it seems I ran out of stuff to do Looting became a chore and repetitive Life in SCUM became boring I tried giving myself tasks to make it interesting Right now I still like the game but it can be so much better The devs took on a tough route making it a super realistic game which I appreciate But with that it can be boring and hard I think they can add so many things to make it more fun but yet keep the integrity of the game I hope they do Cant waitI can piss and shitshoot whatever guns I wantbuild a cabin and live in the woodsget alcohol poisoning and die  Everything I have ever wanted  Would recommendb751bthats a relief Secondly yes you have to

near future The idea with the prisoner island survival show is goodbut has to be expanded as well as the max player count of 64 per server The map is really big and as there arent 2 players on each

and more advanced DayZ in almost every wayespecially when compared to its early access release For an alphathe state of the game is really goodalso compared to a lot of other early access titles I played on their release  dont belive the nitpickers Hopefully SCUM will develop in terms of keeping the excitement after theres nothing left to explore see

there377K16GBweather changesetcResolution  Fullscreen Fix  see the commentsiI’ll revisit this review periodically as I learn more and as things are patchedeven if I have become a bit fatigued with the constant stream of them over the last five years or so But neverthelesswhen Scum went live yesterdayI managed to get in just over 6 hours of gaming on itboth offlinesingle player and online with friends I will say this review is perhaps a little premature in that respect as there’s still so much for me to find out about the game – actually that’s the first thing to notethere is  a LOT of content and a lot of game for an Early Access title  Much more than I expected and although there are bugs and issues Early Accessthere’s actually a lot less than I expectedbut if you’re no into all that you can easily play without paying too much attention to ityet also reasonably spaced to easily find friends and get where you want to be relatively quickly It also looks lovelypathingnot being able to open doors etc they’re still a genuine threatsurvivalists will cream themselves over thisfrustrating t times true If this pisses you offmaybe wait to play till a few versions inthis is everything Day Z should have been Is it too late though Nahit’s an amazing game with so much potential The devs have delivered a game Early Access that already knocks the socks off most rival games in the genre Its exciting to think of how good this could actually be 612 months down the line So far I’d say its more than worth the moneyfirst spawnsurprise ninja attack outclasses shotgunIm done with SCUMCheatsOkfirst of alldont get fooled by the story driven aspect  its a joke Its literally 5 lines of textthe mechanics are complex and realisticboth guns and metabolism Youll have to get used to thatbut in the endits what makes the game great and fun to play Also the visualto most extendare astonishingis that after nearly 2 Y E A R S of developmentwe still got bugs where suddenly itemsor even your gun will randomly disappear  Meanwhile there is an endless amount of items like cigaretteswhich have absolutely NO PURPOSE WHATSOEVER at the momentsaying Its still early accesswhat do you expectis that for 25 bucks and 2 FCKING YEARS OF DEVELOPMENTI dont have to worry about my gun suddenly disintegratingor my corpse and all my stuff to be stuck in the ground where I cant reach it or the MECHS acting out in completely random and unpredictable waysthe game is full of them Speed hacksXRay you name it And EasyAntiCheat doesnt do SHTcheaters are almost free to do as they pleasebecause its so difficult to get hard proof of their cheatingIm not alone with my opinion More and more long time players like me get frustrated with that issue SCUM is a very time consuming gamewhich makes it even more exhausting and frustrating to get randomly shot EVEN INSIDE BUILDINGS from over 6m awaycuz some douchebag is standing on a mountaintop with an aim botbut recentlyI find myself coming back to MINECRAFTbecause at the momenteven that is more appealing than this mess of a gameI have played this game an obscene amount of hoursin fact I would say I know the game better than I know most of my familyso I thought Id drop a review to let others know the pros and cons about Scum from a completely unbiased stand pointwhich is unusual for this genre of gamelock picking and progressive skill grinding for your characterbase buildersbase raidersnomadsgroupssolos etctheres bugs which should be expectedin the pastlost control of the cheating situationin games like this where you spend weeks grindingit can be pretty devastating for a hacker to literally ruin everything you have done in a matter of minutesits just not user friendlynew players may be overwhelmedso you will need to spend a bit of time getting used to itsometimes laggy and stuttery Hopefully this will improve over time DO NOT attempt to play this game if you have a potato PCinfact I would suggest ignoring the minimum system requirements and to not even bother trying to run this on anything other than a GTX 17 or aboveI feel like it definitely has a future and can provide hours of funbut just be aware you will need patienceits not really for casualsWhen me and my friends started playing about a year agowe found it to be an OK game Graphics are really goodsound is excellentbut the gameplay wasnt that good It was still lacking cardsso you spend an evening walking from village to village That meant your character was constantly hungrywe gave it another go The cars are a definite improvementalso the gameplay was better Loot is not abundant and zombies are sneakier The Mechs are still nearly impossible to defeat and sneaking past them is really hard But that makes the game funyour fame point are 7 and zombies dont really bother you anymore Our base was roomy enough for 7 cars2 tractors and 2 quads We were proud gamers Helpling out low level and new players with gearfood and even a car or tractor here and there Playing was now more about cruising and finding that last elusive gunthe MK18veryvery well protectedin a very hard place to findthey somehow got in there Now we were the only 4 players for several months on this server And suddenlyone eveningthe server was catering to 1 players So six new players Somehowwithin a couple of hoursthey found our base and got enough fame pointexperience and gear to get into it Now that is impossibleand thus they must be cheaters There cannot be any other explanation They took all carstractors and quadsthey destroyed all lootall chestsfood cabinet Everything All that was left were some bandages So thats 3 months of gaming down the drainbecause of some cheatersI knowwe shouldnt have played on a PvP serverI can almost hear you say And the name of the game isn’t Scum for nothing But come on people Now I dont care if you shoot mesteal my gearget the loot drop just before mesnipe mesteal a car or even take a st on my corpse That is funthat is what is cool about this game But base raiding isn’t fun Its not And even less so when you are cheatingbecause you cannot be bothered by getting the loot the hard wayby sneaking pas a couple of mechsscouting the countryside for cars and farming for food Nojust by cheating And by doing somaking sure nobody wants to play Scum anymorebecause the rest of usthe honest playersdo all the hard work for you And they are sick and tired to do that So much for a growing playerbasethank you cheaters We will move onbut the cheaters won’ton the servers amongst other cheaters Boring each other to death by cheating Feeling coolkings of the hill and thinking they are “da bomb” While in realitythey sit in the atticat their shty parents housecrying themselves to sleep because in the real worldnobody likes themthis game has loads of potential but i cant recomend it i played 4 hours and eventally left for a few reasonsit just gets boring and repetativeinvisable players running directly in front of you wile they should be visable due to issues with the camouflage system2x the price of any other game with less performance its a rip off but no doubt the devs get a nice backhander so its all good for them i guessit was a great concept but its clear it will always have the same issues even when it gets to release its a massive shame because alot of the stuff thats been added over the months has been great but its pointless having new weapons if you cant use them to kill an enemy due to lag and its really only simple additions anywayits not a multi playerexpect frustration and missed shots if you can even get a shot of with 13fpsi love your game but its broken at its core and all the content updates in the world wont fix it thats whats frustratingWhen me and my friends started playing

cheaters There cannot be any other explanation They took all carstractors and quadsthey destroyed all lootall chestsfood cabinet Everything All that was left were some bandages So thats 3 months of gaming down the drainbecause of some cheatersI knowwe shouldnt have played on a PvP serverI can almost hear you say And the name of the game isn’t Scum for nothing But come on people Now I dont care if you shoot mesteal my gearget the loot drop just before mesnipe mesteal a car or even take a st on my corpse That is funthat is what is cool about this game But base raiding isn’t fun Its not And even less so when you are cheatingbecause you cannot be bothered by getting the loot the hard wayby sneaking pas a couple of mechsscouting the countryside for cars and farming for food Nojust by cheating And by doing somaking sure nobody wants to play Scum anymorebecause the rest of usthe honest playersdo all the hard work for you And they are sick and tired to do that So much for a growing playerbasethank you cheaters We will move onbut the cheaters won’ton the servers amongst other cheaters Boring each other to death by cheating Feeling coolkings of the hill and thinking they are “da bomb” While in realitythey sit in the atticat their shty parents housecrying themselves to sleep because in the real worldnobody likes themSpawnedwalked in the forest for the longest timelooking for

matters more than raw statsso you dont feel like oh the recipe says I need nylon rope but I only have plant fiber rope darn so there wont be any option to fasten my pantsbut personally I enjoy places where you have your space and cant run from one end to the other in 2 minuteswhile unfinished and lacking tooltips on What actually happens when all of that is redtells etc are kinda hard to predict when your FPS is not 1 fluentor sometimes outdated informationthat one is just in the right click menue It is really annoying to go through every single item and see if there is some other craftinglike action I can do with it just put all of it in the stupid crafting view and make a hide simple actions or something button to itso people new to the game would at least know that there is stuff you can do with an itemjust add a decent cooking system on top of that Just have people combine whatever they find and make goddamn stir frys stews and nutritious glob out of it Get the Nurtients from the ingredientsadd a modifier from cooking frying etc  skill modifier less burnt shit for experienced people and such and spices are just a plain bonus to taste Stuff that tastes good is easier and faster to eat than revolting stuff you have to force down If the taste is to horrible since you are trying to feed your guy nothing but puppet intestine stewthen people just throw it up

0,TLDR Dont play this game Its fun for a little whilebut once you reach the end game lvl 40 the gear grind is tedious and progression is heavily gated by both time and RNGdimensional portalsairship dailiesand clan warhouse customizationa garden to manageand nice things to craft with the resources you growcollectwhich can be unavoidable during raid boss activitiesplayer xp levelitem levelskill

convolutedclunkytediousRNG gatedor all of the abovesuch as instant revive scrollsdeath XP recovery scrollsstorageinventory space a necessity if you want to play the game seriouslyStars Blessing game subscription which gives you more XPhigher item drop rateand several other advantages over F2P players These things add up to a pretty significant advantage which many will say is P2Wyou are limited in how much time you can do that activity each dayand converselyif you despise an activityyou will have to suffer through it every day if you want to progressthis game is similar but the combat is not as good as either The game engine Unreal 3 is very old and the game itself looks old Seriouslythis game looks and feels like its been around since 202 If youre looking for something fresh and exciting with very modern graphics and engine capabilities that can take advantage of modern hardwarethis game is not itThe reason elyon is losing players is because its mechanics literally waste your time You go to enhance something and it breaksand its see you next week but quite literally because of the time gated currency system Im pretty sure the probability rates are fake I have 300 hours at time of reviewbut its possible someone with 00 hours has more gearscore than me because of luck At least BDO had failstacksbut this has become more like a job than a fun game If you value your timewould not

lessRebootYoure doneNot surethere may be more garbage to cleanbut Im gonna be digging right about nowI had fun up untill level 43 360 gs slayerthe slayer class is extremely strong if not straight up overpowered so i slaughtered people in pvp and loved but the enhancing system is just absolutely worse than torture its rng on top of rng on top of rng sprinkled with RNG As someone who loves pvp mmosi just cant spend more years and time of my life blowing items up like i did on black desertbut its even worse than that Dont play this gameThere is some review from the guy who play almost all mmos At firstsorry for my englishthisone is pretty good Same as AionTeraArcheageBDOfor me the quests are boring in every single gamesoso yesmany hours of killing mobs if you want to xp fastbut you dont need toi will explain undergood fast action combat Its still early gameso other classes seems strongerbut it will be different in late For example Slayer in early is pretty strongin latelate game he suckswell its deep with many optionsonce you understand it you will propably like itbut its very RNG  againits Korean mmobut you can easily farm them from example pioneer shop  just do blue airships quests Yes you can buy bigger crafting material bag  i dont have it and i never feel like i need to buy ityou can buy many luminiouspets from market and try to fuse your main luminiouspets same as BDObut the RNG will fck uyou will fail and lose your money If you successthe boost from luminouspets are not crucial For meis better to farm it ingamelets take a look what you can do daily and tell medo you have so much timedepends if you go party or solo On party it take 05hour for 4 runs  but depends on partyhard to say For meis OK because 4rewards per day is enoughit getting to be boring after 2runswhere you can obtain 30min of daily dimensional extenderso you can do 5 daily dimensionalso basicaly you would do 5hours of weekly dimensional per dayif you have mats you can craft them afk because it takes some timeand it takes hour5hour57hours content per dayand its fun because you do many different things Its not only gathering and crafting simulatorthere is a plenty XP booster what you can get and just go grindwhich gives you more things to do per weekwhich is pretty fun if you have chill pill guildmatesthe game is not for everyone but its still F2P with no really P2W There is much more p2w games on market You should give a try to this gamethere is not much others fresh mmosVery enjoyable until I crafted my first piece of gear and then went to upgrade it and it broke and disappeared Hours of farming and crafting down the drain My time is too important and limited to be spending hours on nothing productive This single game mechanic ruined the entire experience and I wont be playing anymoreJiggly realistic boobsNearly didnt pick this up because of the bad reviews but so far Im having LOADS of fun I have been playing a lot of FFXIV this year but Elyon is much more suited to my play style New World did not suit me eitherso ignore the naysayersrelease gameIm sorry to say that Elyon is just not very interesting When TERA another Bluehole game was releasedit was very revolutionary for its time an action combat MMO with great look and feel Elyon actually feels like a step backwards  the combat is not as impactful or interestingthe engine performance Unreal Engine 3 is really poorand the game is mostly focused on grinding or somewhat pointless PvPbut unless you really enjoy repetitive gameplay I cant really recommend it past thatthe animationsthe combatthe monsterseven the QUESTS which are TERRIBLE in TERA are better To make matters worseTERA has better performance Elyon is a giant step backwards in every single wayMy personal review on Elyon as a level 44 Gunnerread beloweveryone that plays ELYON is from TERAclasses are so confusingwarlords and mystics are oneshotting me being defensivehealing classsesslayers are just broken in all aspectselementalists have such low range for a good amount of their abilitiesand PVP was just thrown into ELYON without any regard for balance or consideration from PVE into PVPElyon is an mmorpgthat offers a lot of different stuff from other mmorpgs while also implementing ideas from other games Its made by the Developers of Tera and you can definitely feel thatnot P2WDISCLAIMER DO NOT BUY THE WAYFARER PACKAGE AS YOU GET IT F2P BY PLAYING THROUGH STEAM TLDR is at the bottomas all other items minus inventory and storage expansions can be earned easily through gameplayin a timed instance for PvPvEor in RvR Take the KR version guides on builds with a grain of salt because these devs appear to want balance on this game differentthe same combat functions and names for soft and hard cc mechanicseven a cluttered UI However keep in mind that this is originally a Korean MMO and its what you would expect from oneyou are better off looking elsewhereeven mob farming can drop gear however at the moment your most reliable source is farming mobs There are numerous tokens in the game which can be exchanged for pieces of gearhowever most are considered to be breakthroughstrictly because of the effects that the runes providecharacters can swap out their skillsaugmentationsrunesand even their mana passive skill tree for free There are even presets that you can save for skills to switch to certain builds or even change from PvE to PvP focused builds Equipment can even be unbinded by purchasing unbind scrolls from NPCsdaily quests are given in the form of permits 3 permits are used to take a daily quest and some of them take a while to do A separate instance which only allows you to be in it for  hour is primarily used to farm mana awakening xp for your mana passive tree AP which is used to gather on the field and use some housing gathering items comes back slowly They are per characterso dedicated players can use multiple characters to maximize their farm per dayas there are only certain areas or content where you want or have to use gliders If you have a groupyou can take to the skies on an airship for aerial specific dailiescombatas they are tiny rodent like creatures Orcselvesand humans are basically the same with hairstyle differencesvariation in faces and muscular properties Sliders are everywhere as you would expect from a Korean MMOand once you pick one you are locked to them FOREVER Coordinate what faction to play on with friends otherwise it is impossible to party up with them Hopefully this changes in the futurestarting guides from the KR version apply here too Leveling and gearing tips are the samehowever class differences along with best and worst classes are at the moment different Play what you wantI’m only 5 hours inbut I’m having fun I’m not sure who wants this thing to fail but they are really hammering it for some reason with negative reviews I’ve not seen a game where so many of the reviews are completely ignorant PvP battlegrounds with random modifier I am baffled to say the leastThis game is pretty fun until you get to around Level 43 and 400 gear scorePVE combatexploringand lifeskill economy is much better thereNot exactly what I expected Suredisappointing in some ways but blowing my mind in others So many ways to customize your skills While lacking in gear varietyearly mount and flight wings are a definite plus But what does this review matter Its F2Pso just give it a shotReally bois You wanted to ask money for this It does not even come close to tera first versionthe WHOLE game has like 0 NPCS merchantsall with same name and same appearanceattention to detail is no where to be found Story and leveling is not cursiveyou end up needing to grind mobs for hours just to be able to level up and do the next questscontent is lackingif you play slayer Let people farm dungeons wtf is this trash to have only solo dungeons until lvl 40 and at lvl 40 there is only   ONE  dungeonwhere is the content bois What is this 
1,its okcube go jumpthis game is way better than fortnitePlayed for a bitquite addicting I should sayYou beat all the original levels and decide you are ready to go onto something harderyou beat 30 demons till you finally take a step towards your first extremewithin 2 weeks you get 50 on the level and you think you are going to beat it soona week later you have reached 0 percent and can almost grasp beating your new hardest Everyday you tack on hours and hours dedicating time you didnt even know you had to making a square jump over spikesone day all your practice comes to fruition and you die at 96 on the level NINETY SIX PERCENT You have become so obsessed with this achievement to where the game almost doesnt feel fun anymoreevery hour of every day you think about how you could be and should be beating the level its hard to concentrate on anything else as this little square consumes your mind constantly Then one night while talking with your friend in a callyou do itafter over 30000 tries you let out a massive yell of YES Victory has been accomplishedyou have powered through hours of misery to click for 2 minutes straight without dyingthe thing that consumed an uncountable amount of time in your life is overyou did it FuckI love this gameI like the part where you jump in this game This game is great Dbut hard to master DIFFICULTY what does the touch of a woman feel likegamecube go bounceOne of the most versatile level editors youll find in a gamethis game is an art form at this point lolhAfter over 1000 hours and multiple hard demons under my beltI can say that I love this gamenot everyone will though It requires a lot of patience to beat demons but the excitement and happiness you feel when you do so is more than worth it I will be the first to admit I have raged hard at this game due to dying at 9 on hard demons but the adrenaline and how it gets your heart pumping makes me keep coming back Overall Id say if youre up for a challenge buy this gameyoull love itbut if you dont like games as hard as this give it a passMaybehGetting Geometry Dash was the best decision I have ever made I have done way more than any person should in this game and it was worth it I made so many friends through this game I cant even imagine where I would be right now if I just never played this game Overallnot a game meant for everyone for sure But please give it and what it has to offer a chance Thats all Thank you RobTop just jump and u dont dieGraphicsI HAVE NO LIFE
1,The hardest part of this game is convincing your friends to playI know this is just a hypothetical situationbut lets say some rampant disease was preventing you from being able to play board games with your friends WellTabletop Simulator would be your hero00 It lets me play a certain tabletop wargame without spending 000 dollarsPerfect for when youre in a COVID9 quarantinebut still crave board gamesI have been highly sceptical of TTS for a long timetokensand rolling dicehanging around with friends  Thanks but no thanks I thoughtI was wrongI realised how TTS is not what I thought it was  It is not a collection of games whose rules have been coded in an algorithmit is a physics simulator for the top of a table  The fact you use that table to play games on it is almost incidentalyou still get to roll diceshuffle cardsmoving tokens around all while chatting merrily with your friendsthis brings me to the top 3 pros of this game for mecleanupscoringI discovered many more games that I fell in love with and of which I have now ordered the physical copy that I would have never bought of my own accord otherwiseas that is the only computing platform I usei can play warhammer and pay child supportDont make the mistake I made of getting it with no one to play withHave you ever used a table Its like thatWarning Wallotext Incomingmaking it my main game of sorts I had taken a pretty big hiatus from most other games because It kind of lacked fulfillmentgetting tired of grinding on a lot of MMOs I distinctly remember someone in the old group saying oh yeahTabletop Simulator I bought itflipped the table over and overand threw stuff aroundthen closed it out after 30 minutes or soand how anyone considering buying this needs to know this isnt just a physics sandbox This game alone has made me realize how much tabletop gaming has comeand how much it has evolved from My cousin always beats me in MonopolyUNOetcMOST of the games will be locked You wont know how to play most gamesand most public games will be simple things like Uno or Blackjack If there is one thing I could fault the game onI feel the community as a whole should allow a lot more spectating of advanced gamesthis is the only nitpick I would have The real magic of this game is made apparent once you visit the workshop You have virtually every single board and card game at your disposalTwilight EmperiumTicket to Ride Its herelike YuGiOh or Magic The Gathering Every single card in existence is yoursI have about 70 different board and card gamesgames back from the 80s90sand up to games released merely months agoyou NEED thisyou NEED thisyou NEED thisjoin this games discordand find others If you enter with an open mind and willingness to learn new gamesI promise you will not be disappointedPirate yourself almost every board game in existencebShould you pick this up 3 reasons for 3 different types of peoplebbrowser games of chess and other IPs are great but lack the player control to do what you wantGURPSor some other rule systemthese games are hard to put to put into the digital world and if so the software is generally only for you to watch and let the DM move everythingand you can actually build 3d dungeons  httpspbstwimgcommediaBi5dkk6CIAAwhGtpnglarge specially when you really dont care about the outcome of the gamein normal games you are forced to make moves till the game is overin this if you just want to sit with your coffee using the voice chat while you throw marbles and the rpg kit pieces you are free to while at the same time laughing at how bad of an aim you havethere is a single player mode that you can spawn anything in or take it to the online side for fun with friendsthis actually bridges the gap for some of my friends some that like shooting gamessome that dont but everyone can sit around a boardgame and have some funEdit 2 For the people who dont find my review helpful Thats okay We all have opinionssince I wasnt expecting it to get this much attention That means a lot to meits actually a true simulatorbecause thanks to Workshopyou can play any BoardCard game there is You want to make your own game You can do thatand share it to Workshop for others to play There is endless amount of gamesgameplayand fun here its worth the money its asking Nothing much to say hereif I didnt know how to play the game a server is doingthe host teaches me The community tries to make the game funand I like that No kids screaming into their microphones just because they lost a roundand throwing a fit For a game this popularthis is the best community Ive experienced so far for a multiplayer titlebut if there is one in your gameand they mess up everythingyou can ban them from your server and Undo the actions the troll did The makers made the game more Trollfree than any other multiplayer titles with the smart choice of the Undo optionthere is a lot of options for hosts to run their servers You can turn off flipping tableobject spawningand much more So if you dont want your server to get out of handyou can turn some options offand let the games beginbut with a little bit of practicethey arent all that difficultand easy to learn If you use a XBOX controllerits a bit more challengingbut its still easy to control I use my Steam Controller for this gameand they did a good job on mapping the controlsbut its quite hard to get everything into words since there is so much to see and do You have to experience the game yourself to see what I meanyou get to play any BoardCard game with an amazing community This is the most fun multiplayer experience Ive ever been inI created a board game for my wife on our one year anniversary While I was developing the artwork for the gameI created a digital version of the game via Tabletop Simulator I bought a 4 pack the last time it was on sale and gifted the others to friends to help me playtest it I was able to playtest it with a private group of friends as I was designing the finished artworkgetting the cards printedetcI was able to gift my wife a playtesteddecently crafted board gameand it ended up being a lot of fun to playall in two weeks time Thank you to my friends who tested this with meand thank you to Tabletop Simulator for helping me make this happenThe game is great for remote tabletop games like Magic The GatheringChessboard gamesetc The controls are easy to get the hang of theres a tutorial to get startedand the visuals are greatmaking you disconnect constantlyThis is an excellent sandbox for gameboard enthusiasts That is all it is  the DLCs are functioning gamesbut the main game is merely a physics engine designed to work with a tabletop situationthanks to workshop contentyou will have just bought almost then entire boardgame market when you purchase thissince all workshop content is freedont forget that you should support the games developers  without themyou wouldnt get any games at allbut its an excellent way to play stuff you own with others online without having worry about things like covid getting in the way of your fun Also an excellent way to play games which otherwise have a single use such as Pandemic Legacy or similar campaign games which involve changing cards physicallyits really straightforwards to just swap control back and forth while you play Howevernot all work so wellmotor controls are somewhat more limited or advanced in a simulator  games where fine placement is required can be a bit annoyingas can games requiring a lot of passing stuff round or the like That being saidits an excellent environment for games which require a bit more work in real life  rulersstraight line drawingmarking thingsapplying multiple small objects on the boardetc it is even better than real life gaming and can be completed much faster  and some good LUA scripting for games can automate a lot of otherwise irritating or timeconsuming processes on a real version of a game such as counting up pointsetcthough for any more substantial interactionsyoull want a basic understanding of LUA programming to build upbut if all you want is the physics engine and to shove some tokens and a board image togetherits very userfriendly and easy to create something fantasticI wish someone had made this tool to do something chances aresomeone already hasand their servers can play up at timesbut it does have a good autosaveso the host will have a save within the last 5 mins if there are problemsusually allowing you to replay any issues should they occur  and its rare that youll have problems more than once in an evening unless the whole internet is being problematicthough overallits generally got a decently behaved online society  better than mostalthough I have to admitits not quite the same if you dont know the people youre playing withthe same as any boardgames Howeverfor good boardgamesits usually very easy to find other players through other online presences for thembe it Discord servers or forumsetcfrequently with an excellent presence and players willing to teach newcomers and playand regularly comes on sale too  though be cautious if your computer is in the lowend of the price range as the LUA scripting in some board games can choke lowend processers The main thing to remember is that the games are only as good as the person who scriptedmade them  though againwith relatively little effortits also easy to mod them yourselfbWARNINGb If you are thinking of buying this make sure you understand THIS IS NOT A GAMEit is a tool for playing board games I have seen some people in discussions who are frustrated because they didnt know what they were buyingjust like a real table and board game you can pick up your playing pieces and do whatever you want with them If you pick up your chess pawn and move it all the way across the board in one moveor try to balance it on top of another pieceor throw it off the tablethe game wont care the other player mightcheckersbackgammonjigsaw add your own picturepick no of pieces etc but the main meat of the game is the workshop Its reasonably easy to add your own custom cards or dicetokens and boardsand if you can do 3d modelling you can make more complicated  things toosome of them are there with the blessing of or created by the creator of the board game version there are also a handful of paid DLC gamesa few may be prototypes being tested by games designers before they consider making physical versions or homebrewed games created just for TTSsome are not everything you need for a game but may be additional pieces to use in another board game  or for  use in RPGs like DD The vast majority though are versions of physical boardgamesand these are something of a grey arealegallyas the copyright holders have generally not given permission for them to be uploaded Some may not know about TTS or may find it easier to turn a blind eyea few have allowed their products in the hopes that the mods may drive sales of the physical gamesand somelike Munchkinseem to be regularly taken down only to be uploaded again by someone elsesingle player is used for solitaire gamessetting up tables before taking the save multiplayer or uploading as a workshop mod Or just loading up a multiplayer game and loading all the pieces yourself if you wantwhatever floats your boat Multiplayer has options to host a serverbrowse current serversdirect connection or hotseat its better to use the proper hotseat mode than single player for hot seat games as you can then each have your own hands of cardsturn counter etc There is also a global IRC channel which is optionally shown in game as well as text and voice communication Generally public games are pretty goodthere are a few trolls but the mods are good at banning them from global and the host of a game can kick them from games easily if needed You can of course password protect your game so only those you want to join can How easy it is to find a public game of what you want to play really depends on what game it is There seem to always be games of secret hitler for example but if you want a game of Heroquest you might have to offer to teach people in the global channel or arrange a meet up through forums or steam friendsBest game for setting up a DND campaign that you never end up startingLets you play Uno without buying UnoWe are using this for DD now and its awesome User friendly and I prefer to play it this way over in personGuy  Hey manyou want to play insert literally ANY board game hereI cantIm on another continent
1,Im a 6 year old dad and I absolutely love playing this with my 13 year old son  Dont get caught up over losing loot to a raider or reaperits just part of the game  Let your kid set the questor decide to attack a fortor a tornado and just have fun being pirates for an evening  I take the helm and keep us on coursehe works the cannons and is an excellent shotand a great way to talk about how

ship burned downWell after reaching Pirate Legend and Athenas fortune Champion titlesI hope it will help you decide if this game is worth it Ill probably update this review the further I play For now Ill be talkin about the bAdventure modeb but youll learn so much faster in solo trust mequick reactivity on problems ingame through their tweeterso I would recommend to follow them there to not miss a thing and to always be aware of whats happeningXP and achievementswe are lazy and hate to go through google to see our fck ingame event progressionjust put it in game already ffs its 2020so if you like intensive farmingbugscoop and pvp but also the big map youre in the right place Well be waiting for you on the ocean thats what I do and I would have loved to be helped too when I startedso please do so they will always remember youthanks fellow Legendsthe game is still awesomeprobably one of the best open world in multiplayer that Ive played in a while Nothing better but to fish with friends during late nightsjoined a competitive team and reached Legendary Sea Dog So the Arena mode is way different from the actual game adventure It also have its pros and cons so here we go theres only one chest now and its way better than beforeso sometimes youll need to hit 3 time the player before he diesand sometimes you may think theyre cheaterthe playerbase is not that big hereso you might wait 1030min in the worst caseThis game taught me two very valuable lessons in life Dont trust anyone and have a plan to kill everything that movesEdit 122  Its been a while since I first wrote

ocean full of treasure to explore Trulyyou have nothing to lose Until you find treasurethat is Then you have something to lose The game is simply fantastic at giving you a unique adventure every time you sailsolo or with friends And its shockingly easy to play solo if you desirethe smallest shipthe Sloopis very solo player friendly if you wish to be an asocial pirateyou guessed itmore cosmetics This makes the cash shop a little weird But heythe upside is that nobody is going to beat you because they have a better swordshipor gunsbut youre not missing out on anything exciting by not getting the passI felt it was time for an update OverallI still stand by the original reviewwith the same disclaimer that you have to be able to accept the wins and losses both in this game It certainly can be frustrating at times but much like the shipyou have to let it roll off you like water If you let the bad moments cling to you like barnaclesthen youll be just as scuttled as your shipsand after a middling Season 2Content Packed Seasons 3 and Season 5 could be called the quality of life season Theres a decent chunk of new content though nothing like the previous seasonswhich is a reasonably high bar 5 story missions in season 3and roughly 8 or so new explorable lootable areas for season but they also decided to add a buried treasure system Indeedyou can bury your treasure to create a treasure map Thenyou can put that map up on the quest board at any outpost Other pirates can take thisand if they successfully sell your treasueboom You get rewarded too How fantastic is thatthe days go quickly in the sea of thievesand these other player maps will contain buried treasure of their own Of course Quality of treasure may varyas it could be anything Though there are commendations to encourage bigfruitful treasure maps Reallyits a box of chocolatesyou never know what youre gonna getyou lose your maps and need to recover the bundle Or that other people could steal your maps Or you could steal their mapsI guessif youre a jerk While the idea that you can lose your treasure maps may feel a bit unfortunateits lovely design because it means theyre transferableyou could gift the map bundleor simply leave it at an outpost when youre done for someone else to find It adds excitement in that the treasure you buried could be yoinked by a boarder and carried away Or that you could recover your stolen bundle to regain your rightful treasure It adds another layer of things for pirates to bicker and barter overand it means that should things go bad for all involvesthe treasue may be lost to allits something we must learn to accept Rememberthe whole ocean is open to youso long as you go in with the attitude that what happenshappensSea of thieves is fun for all ages Im 36 years oldmy parents are in their 50s and my children are 10 and 12 we all play Sea of thieves The graphics are gorgeous and the environment immerses you in to the pirate life The game has story line aspects with its Tall Tales or you can get voyages to kill off Captain skeletonsbattle skeleton and ghost shipsfind lost merchandise in sunken ships or good old fashion treasure hunting There are world events that rotate throughout the day this includes skeleton fleetsskeleton fortsfire tornadoes that spawn in boss enemies and the infamous Flameheart and his ghost fleetso you are able to attack player ships and vice versa Plusduring your voyages surprise attacks from megladonskrakens and even a skeleton ship can attack This game keeps you on your toes and wanting more I highly recommend itI learned

including the Tale treasurebutI saw a crew of  againprobably same guysthey were fighting a skeleton ship I got close and managed to spot 2 of the  guysconfirming it was the crew that gangbanged me i

saw them jumping in the water I went there to see if they need help and just finished the jobshooting them in the water Then I took ALL their treasureswhich compensated a lot over my lossand went to a safe outpostI lost some battlesbut also won a few First gameplay hours2nd gameplay10 hours straight The PVP element is priceless in this gameotherwise it wouldve become boringmermaids skeleton lords and kraken most of the players Ive encountered in the last days are simply apesI run fast at outpost and manage to sell every treasuresail awaythey chase me for 10 minutesuntil I stopped to see what they want They simply killed me on sightmy ship is emptyI tell them ship is emptyand that Im going on a Talethey simply sank my shipI have 10 skulls9 gems10 treasure chests I see galeon with  peopleI

YOU HAD LOOTSORRY WE SANK YOUR SHIPSORRY WE KILLED YOU 3 TIMES2 of them were LEGENDSI am a fucking bamby learning the gametwo of them have 500 hours in gamethey chose to chase a 1crew Sloop with no fucking lootI get to think this game is filled with low ego real life underachievers for ganging up a fking solosince theres no fun in getting chased every 5 minutes by crew of 3 people that have nothing better to do than bullying a solo player with empty shipin solo modeI managed to make almost 80K Gold in one gameplay and only lost 1 treasure chest to apesit was surprisingly amazing I joined as usualas a solo Scoopbut I forgot to set it to Private After about 5 minutesI get a random crew member who scared the living thing out of me lel He was a legendhe was very funny and helpful For some reasonhe didnt mind playing with me and helping me do tales and treasure hunting I believe I wanted to play for half an hourand ended up playing a 8hour session with himtalking about the game and telling jokes and chilling at some  grog2v2 and 2v3which sometimes went goodsometimes went to shit when we fell of the ship and they stole our ship and sank it into a cliffbut I can surely sayyou cannot play just a half hour session  sessions  30 hours that says it allBy the time I write this review I have 70 hours in this game Ive done pretty much everything you can do around here and max leveld all the companiesespecially the sea Characters do look goofy but thats not a bad thingmake it more expensive or decrease the loot you gainthere are 7 emmissary companies in this game They will give you quests and bonuses on the items you sell if youre sailing with their emmisary flagtea etcthey will buy it They buy everything They dont give you any quests There are a couple items that you can only sell to them Reapers Chest and Reapers Bounty but beware these chests are cursed and their positions are revealed on the map So other players may see you If youre flying reaper emissary flag they will see you BUTif you reach level 5 emmisary you will be able to see other emmisaries on the map to hunt them down You get really good money for selling broken emmisary flags of those people you sankyou can see us on the mapwere up for some pvpcome get us but they raise it to get more money from the items they sell and just keep doing pvethey will be toxic to you naturally and you will deserve it because you made them waste an hour chasing you downyou also get a unique cool flamethrower skull that you can sell for 10k Not badpeople will try to steal it from you This is the number 1 event every server hopper can dream of Its the main attraction for pvp Really the most fun thing to dosteal in adventure modePVP It gives you a pleasure that other pvp games cant Its just a really unique experience battling it out as pirates I dont even do any pve anymore its all about pvpbut oh boy its beautifully complicatedanchor turningadjusting sails to surprise your enemy Having a good captain will make all the difference between winning or losing a battleregular cannons to put some holes incursed balls with million different and very useful purposesfirebombs to put their ship

be the downfall of a bad crew Disorganizedif you send too many boarders and they either miss the target or die without doing significant damageyou will be severely undermanned in your own ship to

review Then it was 100 hours 250 500 FinallyI told myself if I could play 1000 hours of Sea of Thieves by my anniversary in the game Nov 25th2020I would write the review Here I am delivering that promise early Sodo I recommend Sea of Thieves Yes 100 Absolutely Sea of Thieves is not only my favorite game that I am playing now but has quickly become my favorite game I have ever played Amongst my crewthere has been a joke that Sea of Thieves is not a gamebut more a lifestyle If you fall in love with this game like meyou will fully understand what this means But is Sea of Thieves right for youdoing X marks the spot mapshopping island to island in search of glittering gold Suddenly while sailing to Crooks Hollowthe water turns black The Kraken The next day you could be running Reaper chasing another Reaper into the Shores of Gold for an hour and a half for what turns out to be a fg ancient goblet The adventure and story to be told is yours and always unexpectedMegalodonsor the fearsome Kraken There are world events like forts where you fight through waves of skeletons to claim a vault of treasureAshen Winds where you fight a fiery bossand skeleton fleets that have you putting your naval skills to the test howeverthere is always looming the possibility that other player pirates might have their eyes on that same treasure It cannot be avoidedyou will run into other players in Sea of Thieves PvE servers will never happenor events that cause you to break your keyboard I have met great friendsamazing communitiesand some of the most saltyhomophobicand racist individuals to walk the planet I don’t want this to scare anyone though because the number of good encounters far outweighs the bad ones If you do have a really toxic encounterI highly encourage clipping the events and sending a player report into Rare their support system is one of a kindit is much more enjoyable with company My crews and I have had such incredible and epic adventures that we will reminisce on them months after they have happened With friendsyou will write your stories of gold and glory On the other sideI am also a player that enjoys the solitude of the seas and will solo sloop This play style hardens you to the game and will make you a much better pirate Beware thoughyou will sink A lotbut you will also sink No one is immune Sea of Thieves can be a rough gamebut if you get good at the gameit is one of the most satisfying feelings possible Everyone starts somewhereand you as a new player will probably end up sunk a lot while you learn to ‘get good’ Do not lose faith you sweat lord in training youthen please move on As mentioned beforeRare does not mess around with player reports I have had two really horrendous encounters and on both occasions the crews were suspended fast the last one taking all of 3 hours from submit of report to email saying they were suspended I will find youand clip youand report youand then hunt you down until you leave the server That is a promisenay artI have ever seen I dare say the in game water looks more beautiful than real water There are times that my crew is slightly intoxicated and just staring into the sea as the sun sets below the horizon I have never taken so many screenshots and clips than I have in Sea of Thieves Your pirate might look a little weirdbut you will grow such an attachment to your pirate that it becomes a bond I love my strangely long torsoed old man pirate very muchor the Devil’s Roar with its active volcanoes that rain ash and molten stone onto unlucky ships You may also go and take a break in the tropical paradise of The Shores of Plenty Alongside the main map are areas you can only get to by doing the “story mode” Tall Tales The world of Sea of Thieves is rich and alivewith water that thrashes your ship around and shifting winds that require you to maintain your mast position to travel fasterplayers may find themselves firing shots or landing strikes that do not cause damage to their targets While small improvements continue to be delivered during our regular updateswe are continuing to investigate and identify further improvements to improve the player combat experience” Expect to see this foreverand Sea of Thieves is not spared from that I have been rocket launched off a capstanhad a meg flip my ship six tiles North on deathbeen stuck in emotes to crewmates this one is actually really amazing You will rage and cry with laughter at some of the bugs in this game Beware to Steam players thoughevery other update seems to cause a tab out delay bug where if you tab outinthere is a 3 second delay each wayand you will learn from the times you get sunk Never give upbecause there is no other game like Sea of Thieves It truly is the best game ever made As the Great Pirate Lord Ramsey says“It’s not about the Gold It’s about the Glory” May the wind be in all your sails000 Day like000 Day on the Sea of Thieves brought me My crew mate and I sankand got sunk We encountered toxic playersand angels We tried to lure out some spice by doing a Fort of Fortune Upon finding a tucker in a barrel on top of a water towerwe performed an incredible kill by feigning ignorance while “searching” the tower as my partner got a sniper shot ready for the blunder bomb that I delivered after he was a great sport about it all He came back once and after a great fightwe sank him At the end of the nightafter depositing our karma crates on the pier of Golden Sandswe noticed a brig coming to sell from an Ashen Winds event We scuttled our ship and hid They turned out to be the most incredible kids who loved the game one of their “big bwudas” introduced him Awe We emotedthe kid gave an amazing toast in the tavernand we let them shoot us out of the cannons while we logged midair I can’t express how amazing and truly wonderful this game really is Be a good persontreat others with kindnessand rememberon the other side of the pirate is a person CheersAh manwhere to beginwhimsicalcharming Paired with the fantastic water effects and the daynight cyclethe world feels uplifting from minute 1 You can practically smell the crispsalty airand then spend the next 100 hours living your best piratey lifeyou dont level up your weaponsskillsor ships abilities The changes are purely cosmetic and I love it While Ive enjoyed games that require you to level up your gear or unlock movesthis style feels much more comfortable YOU get to decide if you want to invest time in a quest chain that unlocks a new item a cool ships liverya flashy new hatbut you arent penalized for being a newcomer Yesthe fancy canons look nicebut they are just as powerful as the default canonswhich leads to unlocking better paying gigs aka Voyages and coollooking items This works to the benefit of everyone in your crew A sailor who has a higher rank with a specific Company than their crewmates will be able to pick up a betterpaying Voyageand then everyone in their crew can participate I love this if you happen to outrank your friendscrewmatesyou can offer to buy that Voyage Some aspects of play require everyone to be on the same page ieTall Talesbut thats ok Means you can have a positive experience doing oneoff Voyages some timesand other times hunker down and work toward longer gameplay arcsbut only recently bought the game Even though I missed a massive gap of updatesI dont feel left behind I love going on adventures with my friendsor winding down the evening with some soloslooping I live in a different timezone than my crewwhich has meant I have time earlier in my evenings to invest in the preadventure prepwork gathering supplies for the shipfishing and cooking said fish so well have extra stamina Its funand is surprisingly soothingI try to avoid conflict When Im with my crewwe meet it headon Both dynamics are enjoyable Being stealthyhiding behind mountainsdarting around the mapversus gearing up and letting the cannons fly So goodand I come from a WoW background For methis feels like the best parts of WoW You can tackle massive monsters with your friendsyou can choose to grind for random achievementsand you can spend as much time as you want getting sidetracked by treasure and exploration Plusthe outfitslivery options Since the outfits and ship details are purely cosmeticyou can mix and match to your hearts contentyou find yourself getting lost and spending hours NOT doing the mission objectivesbut have a better time for itfor the buccaneer in all of usSunset sailing while playing Bosun Bill with all  instruments is on another level manIm telling you
1,Lmao There are gigantic companies producing multiplayer games that cost hundreds of millions of dollars for development time and marketingand this 25 early access game about mining and killing bugs as a dwarf is the best coop game Ive played in yearsthen bought another round of beer that made us explode forward like rockets So we were all flyingexploding around the space station while sharting and yelling ROCK AND STONE to each other while techno played from the jukebox at the space bar We then threw our mugs at each otherkicked a bunch of barrels into each others facesslapped the fuzzy dice hanging on the dash of the huge drill drop pod thing you go down ingo out into our cave and immediately die from a gigantic detonator just to go back up and get drunk all over againIf ever something said It does exactly what it says on the tin its this gameour driller ran to the nearest wall and drilled himself a dead end grave whilst screaming the entire time over voice chatour gunner fired his minigun from the doorway as I the engi tried to get turrets up just in time to take down the Patrician bug coming up the ramp which then released gas into the entire spawn chamber on death forcing us to leave right in to a chasm where one of us went down to fall damagethis game is the kind of game where you see your allies have torches on their armour and say Heyhow do you turn the torch on only to find your torch was already on and youve made the situation oh so much worsebut it costs gold so you better have mined some You can also call in a giant sentry gunwhich is handy when youre suddenly told a swarm is coming But not so handy if you want to use that gold for a floodlightif you dream of digging and delvingif your beard is longer than your hair then this is exactly the game youre on this page to find Greed and Gold are king here and youll go back into another nightmare soley because you want more credits to upgrade your gear Ive never seen a better execution of what it means to be a dwarf in a scifi settingyou mineyou make moneyyou call the driller a whalepiper for drilling into you by mistake and you yell DONKEY for a box on legs to come and let you drop in your hard earned gold And then you probably dieholding as much minerals as you cansurrounded by stone The dreamEnter a competitionBeg your mother for a copy Whatever you need to do to get this game If you have 3 friends and you like screaming in deep dark pits as everything goes to hell Play itMy review is lengthyso Ill preface my paragraphs with a TLDRthe horde approachesupgradesgrindand endgamebut a fun test of your skills as a dwarfand you unlock the fun stuff at a respectable pace as wellon to my big sales pitchtedious things most modern games like to throw at youcosmetic exclusivesand time

game Ive played in yearsDeep Rock is not only a top tier gamebut its community is top tier as wellI met a Spanish guy spent probably 5 hours with him and my 2 friends we invited him to our discord call and we couldnt communicate a single work but we did several missions and making pop culture references and would just repeat random sounds and referencesgreat experience it did activate my man

Hungerwith the sole goal of eating you you fireand fireand fire some more but they dont stop coming then your light goes out youre now in the pitch blacknessYou can hear the swarm all around you in front of youto both your sidesbehind youeven above AND below you you cant see a damn thingso you desparately throw out another flaremadly attempting to thin out the ever growing tide of monsters that just WILL NOT LET UP youre running painfully low on both health and ammoand you dont have enough nitra yet to call down more You pray to whatever deity may be listeningthat this madness might soon endit ends the tide of hungry death breaksand as you and yours cut down the fleeting remnants of the swarmall goes quiet again the cavern you are inonce peaceful and relatively pristinenow looks like the impromptu war zone it becamewith bullet holes and craters pockmarking nearly the entirety of its surfacebruised and bloodied as you areyoure elated that its over and as you return to the halfmined vein you were working on beforea peaceful calm once again descendsand you continue on your wayonce again the picture of a happy dwarfThis game replaced Left for Dead 2 AND Borderlands 2 as me and my housemates go to coop bonanza Its that goodI cant recommend this game enough  This is an actual coop game where the strengths of all can lead to some truly sublime gameplay  When every player is using the strengths of their character you actually feel like a teamnot a gang of random yahoos competing for individual glorymine resourcesdefeat a bosscollect eggsrepair stuff  Each player has a unique rolethe gunner has a big gun and a ziplinethe engineer can place platforms to help with resource collection and has 2 turrets to help with crowd controlthe driller is able to drill through the environment and the scout has a reusable zipline and can light up the environment  Along the way you collect minerals and gold to fund upgrades to weapons and buy cosmetics  There are always resources to find and collect  Its an important point to note that just collecting the minerals feels satisfying and rewardingthey nailed this aspect of the gamethat is when a swarm of enemies attackand then you have to defend against a seemingly endless stream of enemies  In this regard its very like LDbut there are more enemy typeseach with their own weaknesses and you need to learn how to deal with all of them  The environments are procedurally generatedno two caves are the same but they follow general patternsthe same applies to swarms  There are special enemy typesthe first time you encounter a bulk detonator your first instinct is to run and its well founded but after a while you learn how to deal with them yourselfevery mission has a hazard levelranging from 15  If you arent wanting to change your underpants then maybe go for a level 23 missionor if you wore your official DRG stone panties that morning maybe go for a level 5  The hazard level changes the amount and difficulty of enemies your own personal character level also has an impact on thisas does the number of players in a teamso you get to choose what you feel comfortable with but with higher levels comes higher rewardsyou can level up each charactertheir weapons and kit  Each weapon is well designed and fits with the theme of the characterfor example the scout is not designed to take on swarms so his weapons are weakas a scout your movement is your biggest advantage  The gunner is designed to take on swarms so his weapons are powerful but his mobility is limited  There is also a bewildering array of cosmetics that you can buy with resources you get while playingno microtransactions here so you can customize your character however your likethe replayability of the game will go up although I enjoy the game playing just for its core mechanics of collection and combath1Deep Rock Galactic is my favorite shooter at the momenth1hordebased combat of Left  Deadand the class dynamics from Team Fortress 2 The game is all about going into a cave and completing one of the various primary objectives while fending off waves of fourlegged enemies Upon completing any missionyoure rewarded with goldexperienceand crafting materials used to upgrade your respective class If any of that sounds interesting to youI would highly recommend picking this up The developers are always working on new updates and are really active in their communityso I have high hopes for DRGs future2 secondariesand 3 grenades to choose from What might sound like a fairly limiting choice of weapons at first eventually opens to a pool of dozens of more guns with the introduction of overclocks The basic grenade launcher can be transformed into the Fatboy from Fallout or into an anti material rifle thats practically hitscan The Scouts SMGs can shoot standard bullets without any overclocksbut with them you can make it shoot explosives you detonate or mines that freeze enemies that step on them Your revolver can become a discount sniper rifle or a toxic explosive weapon Theres dozens more ways to modify your gun and almost all of them are viable As of this momentthe next update is adding  new primary guns and Im really excited for that And I hope they add even moreas the guns are a major selling point for meyour support and movement tools are nearly the same for every character While the engineers turrets are highly modifiableitll always be a turret The Drillers C can be built to mine minerals or for purely combat purposesbut it will always be an explosive at the end of the day Something I really appreciate about DRG is that the dwarfs are balanced around their mobility rather than their specifically defined combat roles You dont want a Driller just for his great crowd control You want him for his ability to create bunkersshortcutsand the ability to carve the area into your preference Engineers can use their platform gun to create bridges or makeshift cover This type of balancing allows for all classes to fill a role in any teambut it doesnt feel like a requirement to have one class in particularbut they are there nonetheless I dont like how the game heavily encourages focusing on one class due to overclocks being unlocked once you promote any dwarf The early phases of DRG should encourage experimentation especially since the low level classes are basic and fairly linear with their dwarfs Alsowhile primary objectives are extremely varied in your goalsyour secondary objectives all boil down to grabbing a certain item The hub world is fairly empty as well The only real thing to do is the barrel minigamescrew around with the jukeboxand upgrade yourself in various ways The spacerig would greatly benefit from more additionsespecially a shooting range to test out your loadoutsI really like DRG and I think Ghost Ship Games deserves all the support and praise theyve gotten from itbh1Rock and stoneto the bone h1DRG is intended to be a coop experienceand as a teamyou’ll face a wide variety of aggressive aliens even one that explodes to turn its surroundings into gold while completing one of a few different types of missions ranging from mining operations to extermination missionsyou get down into a caveyou explore the cave and complete objectivesthen you leave What makes DRG special is the fact that the gameplay is incredibly tight and rewardingand it’s combined with superb procedural map generation and four very diverse classes With my current 3 hours in the gameI’ve never had the same experience twice and only very rarely have maps seemed familiarthere’s also voice comms but you don’t need to use them unless you really want toit never feels like a grinddon’t worry if none of your friends have itwhy does this need to be a thing The two heavy classes in particular deal a lot of AoE damage and I found it kind of frustrating to be accidentally damaging or getting accidentally damaged by my team listtight core gameplayand a good amount of allaround variety and you’ve got yourself one hell of a game See you in the cavesbrotherplease check out my other reviews over at urlhttpsstoresteampoweredcomcurator3363386Kemos CornerurlI should have written this review a long time ago alreadyDeep Rock Galactic is objectively the best coop game on the marketand there are several reasons as to why thats the casethe whole teamwork aspect boils down to simply damaging the same targets as a groupand thats it Some games let you revive downed teammates while in other games there is no down and revive mechanic Some games let you share resources or loot togetherbut at the end of the daythere really is no teamworkeach with four classunique weapons and two classunique tools These class tools are what enable teamwork in DRG there are ziplines that your entire team can useshield bubbles that protect your entire teama platform gun to build bridges and other defensesheavyduty drills to drill escape routesstairways and passages through the map Theres also one particularly teamworkeffective duo in DRG which is the engineerscout duo Engineer shoots a platform underneath a hard to reach mineral and scout uses their grappling hook to get onto the platform and mine the minerals I must add that the balance is so perfect that in a group you will usually want one of each class rather than two or more of the same classKilling Floor 2 and Borderlands 2because theyre all very famous coop games that Im familiar withwhile repeating the same objectives that always interrupt your gameplay because each objective is one of the two either run to a specific spot on the map or hold F to interact When all you want to do is shoot coppersthese interruptions are obnoxiousand it gets tiresome to replay the same missions ad infinitum Killing Floor 2 is even worse in this regardbecause the maps are all very bland and samey and instead of getting tired of missionspecific dialogueyou are always pestered by the same exact dialogue regardless of map In the case of Borderlands 2 youre always replaying the same story and thus hearing the same quips and memes over and overwhich gets boring over timeeach of which ask you to do something differentbut for the most part these objectives either never interrupt the gameplay or they actually enhance it Two quick examples being Mining Expedition and Egg Hunt ME is a really simple and straightforward modeyou need to mine a specific valuable mineral until you have the required amount and then you can escape It never interrupts the gameplay because there is downtime between enemy waves during which you progress the objectiveand when the waves come in you can fully focus on that In EHyoure tasked to dig out a specific amount of alien eggs and extract While the execution of this objective is very similarthis objective enhances gameplay each time you dig out an egg theres a chance for a new enemy wave to spawnthus directly enhancing gameplay with the objective itselfBL2 and KF2 In each of these three gamesyou have hundreds of guns to choose frombut none of them feel different Surea shotgun feels different than an assault riflebut comparing assault rifles between assault riflesthey dont feel different Typically the way I describe these games is that for each weapon type you have two real weapons A high damagelow firerate weaponand a low damagehigh firerate weapon If theres 30 weapons in a categoryits always those two archetypes with minor adjustments packaged in a different weapon modelalong comes DRG and changes that entirely Instead of a few hundred gunsall you have is 16 gunsand each one feels completely different from one anotherand the weapon modification system lets you completely change the functions of any weapon youre using A great example is Engineers PGL grenade launcher On the surfaceits just a typical noobtubebut on closer inspectiontheres a complex variety of usage types you can turn it into a railguna nuke launcheror even a rocketjump launcher This is all in addition to the whole low damagehigh damage thingand limited mask customization youll only see while waiting for players to join you KF2 is much the samebut in addition to gun skins theres also a massive amount of ridiculous and over the top character accessories that dont fit the theme of a zombie horde shooter at all In the case of BL2the customization is limited to picking a outfit color set from a limited selectionhatsaccessoriesarmor typesbeardscolorsits insanity Theres a massive amount of cosmetic character customization available absolutely freeand in addition to thatthe weapon customization is the best that Ive seen in any game Ive played each of the 16 guns has half a dozen alternate weapon models that you can unlock through finding treasure while playing the gametheres also more than a dozen weapon recolors available for each gun just by playing the game Last but not leasteverything customization related feels like it belongs to DRGthe game is very true to its atmosphere unlike some other gamesand I bought it somewhere in 2018 I remember playing it a few times and it was a great timehowever other games took my attention and distracted me Then I come back at the end of 2019a year and a half laterand the game has advanced in every aspect imaginable Everything about the game was betterit ran betterit looked betterthere was more mission typesmore biomesmore difficulty modesan endgame systema prestige systemmission end animationsjust it was beautiful Deep Rock Galactic has been getting on average one update a month since being listed on Steamand even after its official launch it is still getting the same high quality development support This is a game that will evolve and expand for a long timeand I do believe it is the best coop game on the marketnot just compared to the other three Ive mentionedbut compared to every coop game Im aware of If youre a fan of coop games there is a very high chance you will fall in love with this game And if youre sick and tired of the repetition of some other coop gamesDRG might just be the savior for youI heartily recommend this game Its a

1,Subnauticas graphics Factorios depth plus multilevel factories are intriguingMinecrafts soothing ability to burn hoursdecent multiplayer even for an alphaI spent  200000 on a computer just to play this game Worth every pennyOh you think you are buying a GAMEa FUNINDUSTRY and MANAGEMENT GAME HAHA YOU FOOL What you are buying is math classesendless hours of calculating to get the most productionminute Is fun thoI spent 30 out of the first 8 hours after installing this game playing it After 1100 hoursI feel like my factory is perfectly balanced and operates just fine without me This is the kind of game that you wont be done with until the game is done with you My success is also my demiseI am now obsoleteIll start mining this iron ore and then Ill go to bedI should start making copper wirebut then Im definitely going to bedbut then Im definitely going to bed promisebut then Im definitelyabsolutelygoing to bed Promise x 10but then Im DEFINITELYABSOLUTELYgoing to bed promise times infinity 1I have never felt it more necessary to completely demolish everything I have done just to make it 10 more efficienti locked my enemy under my base the fire ball spitting demon will stay there until i have mined his world into NOTHING And thenI will free himand he will be my LASTand he is the bottom The prison Where he belongs He kills me when I try and manage the bottom layer of my production lasagnabut thats alright His time will comeExcellent game I was initially put off by reviews saying that you still have to link your steam account to an epic store equivalentand that you could not play single player  All these are lieslolIf engineering is your jamthis is very much not jamSatisfactory has become my favorite game of all time Been gaming since Pong was the only one I have had my fill of runningshootingand collecting gems I enjoy building complex systems of manufacturingtransportationand storage facilities I have a traumatic brain injury and what I like about this game is that when my migraine headaches cripple me for a week at a time I can lose myself in this game for 6  8 hours with complete interest and focus I can tear down a factory and rebuild it with a completely new design in an afternoon This game allows me to feel like I can accomplish something really excitingcooland interesting all while my head is pounding away Satisfactory seems to give me just the right endorphins needed to combat the pain Plus its really funThis game is weirdly addictive  You think youre just gonna sit down and play for a bitthen suddenly its 2am and you have to wake up for work in 5 hoursBought it and cant stop thinking of conveyor beltsthat hasnt happened since the release of Terrariawho hates gamessits besides me and wants to help me buildI dont need sleepI need efficiencybSPOILERFREEHONEST REVIEW FROM 600 HOURS EXPERIENCE ON EPICbup to  playersdropindropoutpeertopeer Dedicated Servers for Experimental Version Currentlybut you dont need to defend your base in Satisfactory Think of Satisfactorys challenge more like clearing out biters from strategic resource depositsthe game has an entire extra THIRD DIMENSION What more could you possibly want But the third dimension greatly differentiates the logistics challenges between Factorio and Satisfactoryyoull have access to THAT games technologiesprogressand the developers have been quick to fix any gamebreaking or frustrating bugs as the result of a new updatebut the developers have hinted at story elements being added to the game in the future There IS a tutorial that walks you through concepts in the gameand then progression and exploration is left up to youbut ithats a good thingi The continent is 30 square KILOMETERS and every inch was handcrafted by humans It takes 18 MINUTES to walk from one corner to the next Only the most dedicated players will experience the entire planet in a single playthroughor you could play the game 20 different times for 20 different challenges And from the moment you land on the planetyoure given an openworld to explore there are hidden caveseaster eggs made by the same devs as Goat Simulatorso you know its gonna be goodoptional jumping puzzlesunique resources to collectalien creatures both friendly and aggressiveand moretheres an growing thirdparty modding community I use mods every day to record YouTube tutorial videos As I write this reviewits not clear if Satisfactory on Steam will use the Steam Workshopor some other methodthere are a lot of spoilers thereI run a YouTube channel with clearnoBS tips and tricks to help improve your factories httpswwwyoutubecommaxthecatfish and theres an active streaming community on Twitch as well  httpswwwtwitchtvmaxthecatfish is Satisfactory for mebOxygen Not IncludedRimworldTerrariaMinecraftall extensively I love thinky games like these and othersand Satisfactory provides so much moresmelt it into iron barscraft those iron bars into iron rodsturn those rods into screwscombine those screws with some iron plates and youve crafted your first Widget Now craft hundreds more and combine your widgets into a MEGA WIDGET So on and soforth If that sounds boring to you  picking yourself up by your bootstraps and literally building up civilization from scratch  then you might want to stop reading here That saidmany of you have likely played Factorioor adjacent games like Oxygen Not Included and are wondering if its worth letting go of a few more of your Insert Local Currency Here for a similar gamewith the sheer joy and excitement of an openworld exploration game In Satisfactory you might spend equal time tuning and designing your factory as you will exploring the continent hunting for unique resourcesupgrade modulesand staring at awe at the planets 20 handcrafted biomestoo Want to build a factory that looks like a sprawling megacity Do it Want to create a regal Grand Central Station for base Go for it Want to litter the countryside with phallic effigiestechnically possible But the beautiful thing is that you dont HAVE to do any of these Oryou can do them all – whenever you want The game as it stands is entirely openended and relatively stressfreefrom the moment you gain control of your character you can do whatever you’d likego wherever you’d likeand that freedom is…exhilaratingyou can have that If you want a sandbox to build in then – in all honesty  Minecraft might be more your style   but you can ALSO accomplish that in Satisfactory with the right mindset The game provides both mental and dexterity challenges but you can bypass each of these in creative ways using the tools at your disposal in ways that feel authentic to the gameplay experienceyou’re on your ownup to four pioneers can build togetherfight monsters togetherplan factories togetherrebuild factories togetheryell at each other for rebuilding that part of the factory without consulting the othersdelete a pivotal conveyor belt out of spite for being berated by your friendsthen go off and form a NEW factorywith NEW and BETTER friends who know that conveyor belts should be build at 90 degree angles and how DARE you even CONSIDER using the default recipe for crafting screws when the steel screw recipe is obviously superior in both throughput and resource requmaybe the singleplayer experience is best for you I kidof course – it’s a nice change of pace to experience the full breadth of the game with your friends And for the most part the multiplayer experience in Satisfactory is smooth The game IS still in early access and there are a number of known bugs and issuesbut allinall the game has been relatively bugfree and that’s an accomplishment worth praising these days The games team is incredibly communicativeand the community has responded inkind with communitydriven resources like satisfactorycalculatorcom and the ficsitapp unofficial modding communityyoull enjoy Satisfactory If you want an FPSforward adventure gamelook elsewhere But if youd like some factory building mixed in with planet exploration mixed in with a bit of combatyou should absolutely consider buying SatisfactoryWARNINGhave a girlfriendwifekidsor have anything important to do in the near future You will become addicted and productivity in other areas of life will drop by at least 50 I have stooped low to the point of having this running in the background while at work to stockpile My fellow gamers at work are wise to what Im doing because my laptop fans are churning awaybut I dont care All that matters now is setting up new production lines at 100 efficiencyDo you like conveyors Likereaaaally like themthis is a game just for youDid you like  play  Minecraft TekkitI thought this was going to be a game only about optimizing your factory in an essentially sandbox environment What I got was a rich game with a very well designed alien world to explorewith subtle messages about environmentalism and the beauty of nature contrasting with the efficiency of machinery  There are literally breathtaking vistasvast beautiful cave networksimpossible alien landformsand completely on point music and sound direction  The slightly sinister feeling nature of your FICSIT overlords lends some deep nuance what are you actually doing here What role are you playingand who are you servingbut Im not one to overdesign to get thereso my bases end up having a naturalistic base camp feelwhile my friends are building towering factories with rows and rows of machinery Im really glad to saythis game supports both playstyles fantastically I see my friends having a blast designing and organizing monolithic black cubes full of layers and layers of machinerywhereas I love spreading out and nestling my machines in with the trees and cliffsand possibly animals that caretake and develop their own resources as well This might not be the game for thatand if youre also wanting to see an alien ecosystem spring to lifeI highly recommend Subnautica HoweverI cant deny the intentional design I feel in segments of this game Collecting power slugs to me feels like collecting Missile Packs in Metroid They are usually placed in areas that have a similar challenge feel to themand are a wonderful reward for exploration  I cant wait to find out what Somersloops and Mercer Spheres are forbecause they provide such an intense incentive to explore that I think is missing from some games like thisparticularly with enemy AI Its very rudimentary and when you master kiting enemiesthey dont provide that much of a challengeeven with the Xenozapper  Its only when they congregate and team up against you that they feel like a challenge  On the other handthat complexity is used to great effect in the placement of hostile mobs todayso I cant knock the simplistic AI too much because it combines and scales difficulty fairly welldespite the somewhat limited toolkit for designing these encountersplacing the Space Elevator is a religious experience I dont care how jaded you areits a masterstroke of technology that that sequence plays out so organically and dynamically You really feel the scale of the structureand it changes the skyline foreverI often find myself hitting the number row to switch my inhand equipmentonly to remember too late that those hotkeys are for your building toolbelt  Id love a way to switch between modeseven if it just means holding shift while pressing a number gets the build mode quickbarand just pressing the number equips a new item to your hand slot  On the other handthere are some very nice Quality of Life touches that I appreciate once Ive gotten used to the quirks of this game  Actually placing buildings is decently streamlinedand I appreciate the way building off of foundations allows for a very granular angling Once youre started building a foundation to fit the areathe 90degrees snaptogrid functionality feels very useful  The only complaint I have here is the sometimes janky feeling of trying to get conveyors to snap together It can be very finicky about what counts as a valid angleand the feedback isnt always clear about why a conveyor cant be constructed Encroaching others area ends up being a somewhat frustrating exercise of shimmying things around in minute ways just fiddling to get the lines all connectedthoughthe game is beautiful enough to warrant the price tag I dont just mean graphics specifications and technical aptitude The design of the games assets and their placement creates spellbinding beauty The way biomes flow into each other feels extremely organic and immersiveand Ive never seen transitions so smooth in any other game It feels like it surpasses Breath of the Wild in this respectand some of this may be because setting this on an alien world helps smooth over any strangeness in geology or botany that would subtly break immersion otherwise  There are so many systems in this game to become familiar withand the tech tree feels so rewarding and rich that it compels me to develop more and more  All in allthis is genius design Mad respectIts all fun and games til you have to walk 3000m for some coalJust spent the last 9 hours building a km pipeline for crude oil It was pointless to spend so long making it look so goodbut it gave me a sense of achievement and completion
1,i am 77 years old and i spend all my days playing this game More i play more its interesting Iplay  on 3 screens with a logitech steering and paddles I choose auto transmission o both euro and american and I can say its really niceThis is the first time Ive ever left a review on Steambut I had tothe amount this game has gotten accurate is nothing short of impressive I have since hung up my keys and live my days retired from the lifebut firing this up with some noise cancelling headphones and hearing the engine noisesthe turn indicatorthe trafficthe air brakesall of it takes me backlike how if you try to GTA ityou have increasing fines but IRL you flat out lose your license and face jail time lol Id rather focus on what it DID get rightthe way they increase really makes it so if you do try to GTA ityoull eventually start spending more money in fines than what you get from the load Making it so that your profit margin increases dramatically for safe drivingquasi crazy the second oneand perfectly safe the third time I noticed that I made more profit with fewer deliveries by driving safe So while the game cant take away your CDL for constantly running red lights and scraping the side of a carthe fact you just simply cant make a profit unless you drive safe was a nifty implementationbut Id rather be playing it right now I tried the demoimmediately pulled inbought it on saleand once I really experienced itI didnt even question buying all the available DLC and now anxiously awaiting the new statesmake sure you put the entirety of Dallas under constructionforever Make sure no one ever uses a blinker And make sure any shippers in Laredo have trailer yards so small that even the most skilled drivergamer cant park a damn thing in it because they just simply cant moveI hope I stay alive long enough to see that lol I would love to hop I40 from Barstow clear to WilmingtonNC Or I0 from Cali to FloridaAs a former trucker with over 8 million under my belt i got this game last night becaused i miss the road   It is almost like the real thing  the trailer responds exactly like it does in real life and yes i was able to put in the dock on here just by using my mirrors   i highly recommend it because if you ever wanted to be a trucker this is about as close as you can get to it without actually climbing into the cab and drive itIm a disabled retired owner operator trucker who is unable to drive cross country now I really enjoy the realism and opportunity travel virtually to places I cant go to thanks SCS and Steam for all the hard work to bring this to usI retired in 207 and the next year I bought this game to meet a minimum shipping requirement online It was a great choicethis game fits my requirementsWhen I first picked up ATSs older brotherETSI got it heavily discounted while drunkthinking Might be fun to ram cars off the road 5 or so years laterI got my Class A Commercial Drivers Licence because of these games The first time one of my friends saw me playing thishe thought it looked boring as hell I didnt think he was wrongbut I told him to try it for himself He got his CDL before medue to its deceptiverelaxing nature This may be simply a gamebut its ramifications can be life changingas a truck driver myselfi find that ats is the best truck sim out there i had to retire at age 3 because of bad health i miss driving so much that this game is the only way i can ever get back in a truck its super fun and very well put together  iv already told people about this game and most said they will check it outWonderful gameIve been here before Or not or one more clover highway spread sigh while in ATS its always something new wherever you go And you feel the warmth when you come back to familiar placesrelaxing and enjoyable Not too boringnot too extreme ETS2 has very sharp and plentiful turns Whatever you prefer Personally I love ATS You still get enough turning off the highwayin the city or on narrow roadsless often by cameras So you a have to look around to see if theres police nearbyb you have to watch your speed and current limitc you can decide if you want to keep your money or pay a lot for a questionable right to break the laws Wanna be a rebel Go ahead D  Overall it adds to the gameplay very well Surprisingly well I hated speed limits in ETS2they were stupid and cheaply fined and mehless for fast simple onenone for just ditching the trailer at arrival Small bit but also adds to the game scoredepending on my mood ButI must admitI love ATS more Its an upgradeafter all its time consuming and may be boring But its not the games faultfor sureI just received my real CDL license This game actually helped me do my backing up for the DOT test I built the same truck and trailer and passed with flying colors as it taught me what to look for on the actual maneuversI was going about 00 mph on a freeway and had a school bus spawn literally right in front of me The kids on that bus are now with God and my truck is toomy daughter bought it for my birthday i used to be a truckdriver but got to old for the medical test to passI first saw ATS a long time ago when I watched my son playing it but wasnt keen to be a driver here while I was driving for real Wouldve been too muchalthough I was really interested and helped him with turning and reversing and stuffalways haveits a passion About a year after I retired I got the urge to keep the passion alive so I started a Steam account and my son gifted ATS to me as an early Christmas present and Ive been driving here since Oct 206take a load somewhere and experience the sunrisesunset and the great scenery Ive done a lot of real life night driving into daylight and when it happens in the game its so real I yawn and feel that special tiredness you only feel when daylight breaks and youre still behind the wheeleven though it might only be two in the arv at my place Im always thinkin about when Im goin to be drivin next and what Im gunna doAre you comin to bed yet I sayIll just drop this load off and Ill be there Then a couple of hours later I hearWhen are you comin to bed and I say the same thing again and hearYou said that two hours ago Thats how it is and thats what it does The best form of addiction I could ever recommend My personal opinion ATS  Its a lot better than going to bedWhy did i get this gameSo i wondered what it would feel like driving a big tractor trailerAnd so i got thisI cant say if its anything like a real truckBut this game does get very very complicating when it comes to parking with your 53 containerAnd it makes me wonderWow Those guys must really have some good practice Because if i cant do it hereI for sure wont be able to do it in real life xDDriving next to other truck drivers and then honking at themor meeting new friendsSOME actually truck driversand then traveling with themStopping to weight your freightgetting gas and suchIts a very fun experienceBecause I feel like i havent played enough to experience any problems or bugsBut the game is very fun ONLY IF YOU LOVE SIMULATOR GAMESIf you dontThen maybe think twiceBut I enjoy simulator games And if you want to give this game a try as your first Simulator gameThen i would recommend itI recommend it to people who want to give Simulator games a tryThis is a perfect one Or Euro Truck Simulator Although if youre from the USA i recommend this oneBecause Euro Truck Simulator has different driving rules than USSo you might get tickets for some things you dont know lolIts 2am in San DiegoCa You just picked up a double of graveland its your job to get it to Carson CityNV in one pieceor two pieceswhatever Its your first doubleand you just bought a longer truckso youre on edge as you snake your way through the narrow corridors of the miniture representation of Southern Californiapraying that you took that turn wide enough to avoid that stop light You finally make it to the highway onramp Traffic is pretty heavy for this early in the morning Luckilya tour bus stops in the middle of the highway and lets you merge Weirdbut appreciated none the lessas you snake your way through California You put on some music to fill your ears with something else besides the low rumble of your Pete Suddenlytraffic in front of you comes to a halt Thankfully for you and your fellow commutersyou kept enough space between you and themand quickly pressing on the brakes brings you to a rather abrupt stop You see flashing lights ahead of youandis that a plane After waiting for a few minutes for your brothers of the road to figure out how to zipper into the left laneyou pass what is indeed a small plane on the highwaysurrounded by cones and a cop caryou cruise into Carson City This is itthe moment youve been waiting for You roll up to the little booth at the entrance to the company yard and press Enter Two options flash before you Isnt there usually three AnywayAuto Complete or Where do you want it Your mouse hovers over the autocomplete Im basically doneits just a few XP right No Earn those points Carry that weight You defiantely click on the harder option You slam it click it into gear and hammer down You get about five feet down the dirt path thenTHUNK Your truck stops on a dime You slowly swivel your head to your left mirrorand horror grips your heart Your last wheel is stuck on a poleyoure not that great at backing up a single trailerlet alone two You ponder what to dobefore deciding to just go for it You gingerly put the truck into reverseslowly backing up into traffictrailers going north AND south Back in driveyou ease forward Your last tire clears the pipe by a hair You breathe a sigh of relief as you cruise past the gate guardwho seems too awestruck at your driving prowess to react or move or breathe Rounding the corneryou see the little outline on the ground Cut it wide right then back leftease her up until that little prompt flashesand youre doneand 5000 heavieryou pull into the gas station After filling up your truckyou check the job screen After that ordealyou look for the smallest trailer possiblebut whats this An oversize load Can my truck pull that Probably notbut itll be downhill all the waybut a story doesan experience does If a story is filled with glitchesbugsand general hatredIll pass You read through all of this or skipped to the end idkand you can make your own choice based on this and the thousands of other reviews for this game Its not everybodys gamesure Its not too exciting The AI is weird at times and a poor judge of distance at others Howeverif youre looking for a game to sit down withgrab a nice cup of caffrumcapri sunand zone out for a bitI think youve found it It runs wellthe trucks are fun and responsivethe loads are varied enough so you wont be hauling the same thing over and overunless you want to Jump in the cabfire her upand Ill see you on the roadAs a RL Truck Driver I think they done an amazing job with this gameregarding physicsgraphics and basically everything else especially how you can float the gears like in real life if you have a steering wheel and shifter I really enjoy this game Things I dont like They need to add a bigger variety of trucksthey really need to add Freightlinersand a few more models of each one Like the classic Freightliner and Petesome cabovers and some more of the newer models as well I guess the one thing that bothers me the most are the truck stop gas stations I dont know about in other countries but In the US they dont have 2 pumps in one row like a car gas station They have  pump in each row and the one on the driver side is where you swipe your card and put in your info and the passenger side is just a pump so you can fill both tanksso at ever truck stop there is a pump on both sides of the truck in every row If SCS reads my review I hope you all will do some research into US truck stops and hopefullyeven though Im sure it would be a little bit of workwould redo the truck stops to be more realistic and maybe even get the licenses to rename them I would love to see a Pilot or Petro in the game Other than that I do highly recommend this game to anyone that likes simulated driving gamesi drive exclusively on the shoulder at full speed to avoid speeding ticketsI downloaded this game because I needed something less violent for my kid to watch me play I didnt expect to enjoy it It was just because he saw the big rigs and got excited Yetlong after he had fallen asleepI found myself still on the open road with cargo in tow working towards my dream of long haul empire I dont know why I like this game so much I dont know why this game is so exciting I dont know why Im finding myself thinking about this game while Im at work But yetI do I recommend itI just like driving without having to spend real money on gasAs a now disabled former OTR driverI like to call this my driving therapyTake your headphones off when you launch the game
1,Fall Guys is a  chill and fun game  but it really needs server improvementsworkshop map creator and more mini gamesI gave a little Hug to a playerhe stared back at me for 5 seconds and then jumped off the map and killed himself and never before I felt as much power as I did up to that momentId reccomend it so much id buy it for youyou can hug peopleWhen I was a little boyI liked to see the Wipeout on TV I always dreamed of taking part in itIts nice to have BR thats just about having fun 1010 would fall again我是傻逼Heres what I see in this game potential Is it the best designed game out there No Is it the best multiplayer game out there No Is it the best optimized game out there at least at the time of writing No But what it does have is an amazing base game thats incredibly addicting Even for the 20 its selling forwhich in my opinion is a bit highits still a fantastic game that is incredibly fun to play with a group of friendscustom matchesthe lack of mapsactually being able to use your own name loland the crackdown on cheating to be completely fair I havent encountered any If youre skeptical about the gameI wouldnt blame you for waiting for it to go on sale or waiting until more content is added Weve seen this song and dance before games release with a bare bones experience thats wildly funbut gets old fast That being saidI hope the developers continue to make this game better and better Cut them some slack toothey got flooded with a player base they couldnt have expected Let them get back on their feet after the floodgates openedand show us what they can doIm having a ton of fun so far but its got a bit of a ways before its really amazing 810Fun in short burststedious in long stretches at the momentBlock Partyor Perfect Match need to always end based on eliminationsand they need to be faster and harder as right now they are so easy they are a choremaking your random chance even lower Fall Ball is also incredibly common because of its flexible player count requirementand Im absolutely sick of this minigame These are the worst and need to be their own game mode separate from the other game modesFall Mountain is a race where more often than not the person in the lead stays in the lead because there arent enough factors to mix up player positions Royal Fumble is basically luck based depending on whoever in the cluster  manages to grab the tail within the last 5 seconds HexAGone is actually really good Make these better by transferring survival games here and making them progressively faster until only one person is left standingbut since things are repeated so often many of the maps feel like a chore The number of levels increasing is likely to become the case as time goes onbut at the moment it Fall Guys biggest problemand there isnt enough of variety or customization options for costumes to really make you unique and stand out Every Gordon Freeman costume wearer looks the sameexcluding the face colorregardless of your pattern or color Againthis will hopefully be fixed as more content is added over timebut because of how much fun I had playing it and how much potential it has for the future I think this would be a good game to support and maybe play in moderation right now If you think the repetitiveness of the maps will be too much for you then hold off for now The goal is to have this review become outdated simply by adding a substantial amount of new minigames If this goal is achieved I genuinely think this game might become one of my favoritesStop grabbing me Im trying to winIts such a great game Had fun while playing BUT you need to get rid of the cheaters ASAPPLEASEThe Devolverland Expo led me to Fall Guys  I was a little reluctant to get involved in a Battle Royale style game as I generally suck at competitive play but the sheer gleeful hilarity of this game more than makes up for the frustrationsupbeat musicsnappy mini games and lovable characters all bumbling their way to victory or slimeyes it is and I love itgee forty hoursseriously  In that time I have managed to win two episodes  Bear in mind I am terrible  Two victories out of hundreds of failures  Sweet sweet victories  This sounds like a pretty bad ratio but really each victory feels truly momentous especially considering the ever increasing number of cheating hackersbut now it is the norm and it is really making me lose interest  This is supposed to be Fall GuysNOT Fly Guys  There is very little competitive edge when you know the dude who is hovering above the level is going to automatically win  I am now at the grinding stage just trying to collect the rest of the cosmetics for the seasonand unless Mediatonic add some kind of anti cheatthis is going to quickly lose the large casual audience  We shall see what Season 2 bringsbut if the hackers are going to be allowed to continue operating I dont see myself joining the ranks of hopeful suckers never able to get a legitimate winwhich I know has been a bone of contention in some other releases hello DOOM Eternal but it was desperately needed here and to be fairI havent happened upon any filthy dirty hackers since  So now I can get back to being terrible through my own volitionIm off back to my glorious upbeat technicolour failureIgnore the negative reviews about server issues Theres no way they could have predicted the player base would be this big If anything its an indicator about how fun the game iseveryone wants a piece of itCool funny chill gamebut actually 20€ for that game idkkinda little bit overpricedhopefully will there be an faster report system to ban those playersif you dont know what to playA battle royale thats funwhy did no one think about this beforeId recommend this game for all agesvery fun to play D It would be better tho if they added some custom game modes so you can practice maps or you can play with your friends only Overallits a really fun game if youre looking for something frustrating yet exciting at the same timeI never expected that running Tic Tacs can be so fun and malding at the same timeit needs more maps but still funThis game is fantastic The devs are super involved with their community and the future seems really bright The Takeshis Castle influence is strongtoofor fans of that show Its practically a hugging simulator tooif youre in to thatHackers destroying this game  most of them only use their hack on final matchIll change the review when dev provide ways to report hackers ingame
1,BETTER THAN EFOOTBALL 2022EA still charges 60 every year for the same gameat least Konami can admit they didnt do much this year and charge much lessAyat least they warned everyone it is the same gameunlike some other companyAt least they warned everyone it is the same gameunlike some other companyyeah its a season update but its discounted  does actually have a fair few improvements The UI polish is greatly appriciated aswell as the gameplay changes which dont fix the ai completely definitely make it more bearable Aslong as 2022 is solidas it should be a huge upgrade moving to a new engineim more than happy with the changes here for the considerably lower asking price than usualMost people already know Konami is working on PES 2022at least they offered this for cheap with bonus items and are honestunlike a certain other companyI dont play onlinejust Master League no matter which difficulty level you chooseits just impossible to play because the game decides for you It compensates all the time Do you just spent your club money buying Messi Ohdont worry he will never be able to dribble an unknown defender from a Serie B unknown club But if he can and he shootssaid shot will never end up into goal it will hit a postthe goalkeepereven your own teammatesor maybe just goes 70 degress off from wherever you aimbut it will never be a goal Next match is against Manchester United You can win 50 easilyeach update changes something for worse The last one i dont know namesjust around end of May 202 just changes ball physics and the way players receive passes among other things Now it bounces all the timeeven if its raining If player is able to receive the ball wit its chesthe will make THE IMPOSSIBLE to receive it with his leg raised at mid height and make ball incontrolable Ohand now your players wont jum andor use their heads for any reason dont worry neither rival players I dont know whymaybe they are just tired Pandemicmaybe but seems like Konami wantseven at their worst featuresof Banana Soccer 2022or whatever stupid name MKT team decides is better because they are decided to destroy everything a brandan earned reputationa healthy community of football playersyou name itreal club namesif you can see acne on players faceswhatever Im sure Im not the only one who wants to play in a simple simulator that respects players and the most beautiful sport in the world See how many hours Ive gave to this game Im tiredsadand dissappointedThe last good PESmay bethis game is so realistic im in 2035 in ML and milan still hasnt won any championshipI was playing Pes 2020 for two years waiting for the 2022 versions because I had been hyped by the whole new project 3 days before Pes 2022 was published I received a message that pes202 was in a 80 sale and I said its just 6 euros for a game that I would like to have I already had 6 euros in the pocket so it happened Todayafter reading the reviews about the pes2022 I think buying this game for 6 euros was the best purchase I did the last weekat least they told us it would be the same gameatleast they told us about the season update unlike other companiesBetter than Fifa 2I meanI did not believe the reviews and comments about the scripted gameplaybut holy moly they were rightbut I wanted to give it a couple more games before kicking it up a notchmy win score would become lower and lower 50300 etc And the quality of the opposing teams was not the factor herenomy players were becoming really bad and in the end they were unable to send forward a straight pass without issuesthey did not make any runs when off the ball and played like absolute monkeysthe opposing team started playing like Real Madrideven when their team was absolute garbage on paperlike a switch was flipped I was not playing vs the other teamI was playing vs the controlswith good controls and enjoyable gameplayit turned into absolute mayhem of garbage over the course of maybe 56 gamesbut not like this DisgustingAbsolutely DO NOT BUYeven at this pricelike myselfi have enjoyed them until PES 206then i took a breaksince i enjoy playing my favorite Master Leaguebut i can positively say that i absolutely know to play the gamethis years game is broken You start your new save and if you are a romanticyou choose the default roster so you can see what you can do with the new CastolosMinandas and everyones favorite misfits You surely expect difficulties and a strong challengebut this year its not about thatwhile even your strongest player gets blown away like a child before he can do anythingignore the ballstop momentarilly and lose momentum every time they need to run either defencively or running at the oppositionits unfair The mechanics and core rules of it work ONLY against the player That absolutely takes away the football experiencetakes away the fun You feel like battling with the AI both opposition and teamates You feel that your effort is wasted when almost every match seems like having a background narative and needlessartificial drama Even winning leaves you frustratedlike a tedius work thats left uncompleted and unrewardinggreat ideasbut everything fades when facing the above Such a pityBeen playing PES for almost a decade nowheres my takea huge difference from the 2020 versionwhich had pretty horrendous gameplayhigh latencyplayers with 80 passing screwing up simple passesCPU scoring off every free kickmy defender will be glued to the striker when suddenly the striker turns and shoots effortlessly while not even facing the goalgoes in 75 of the timebut the shirt sizing is somewhat wonkyperhaps add a tight kit option that fits more snug to the torsoStill better than PES 2022bEtTer tHaN fIFapes 202hPES2 Review with REALISM Mods  UPDATED REVIEWheven details like dirt and tight kitsreal kitsballsboots Lots of licensescustom real stadiumsbetter lightingturfsfog  New animationsintro scenesfans chantsanthemsmore managersfull cameras customization Its a whole different game I cant stress that enough If you enjoy the gameplay a little bitplease go after Mods Some hours of installations and whatever will pay offsome dumb and funny moments occurplayers seem more human and less gods in comparison to FIFAbut FIFA now has more customization and contentmore stuff to do out of the matches Howeverin PES it feels like your formations and strategies matter moreand this is rewarding In FIFA just buy fast paced players and youre good to gobut FIFA looks more stable servers and has many more players AlsoFIFAs FUT has a big market behind itso at least you dont feel like you are playing a dead gameI can clearly say that FIFA has better visualsalthough animations are somewhat unnatural A nice thing about PES is that if you watch it without Interface and from a Broadcast camerait looks closer to a real life matchwhich is goodyou will probably enjoy itintroslicenses and graphicsor if you only play onlinebecause its more established
1,I saved my car from sliding off the expressway IRL because of this gameI have committed war crimes using a 21 Honda Civicthis game really makes me wanna crash my car in real life and see if the physics match upI love hitting cars Then coming home to play this and hit more cars 11Ive had it since it released on Steam day 1 and have accumulated 37 hours to date I think I can safely recommend itLife is the best BeamNGdrive simulatorsome things I like about this gamewhich are very detailed and have many different areascontrolleror steering wheelGraphicsIve been driving for well over 2 years nowand Ive never gotten myself into an accidentalways watching out for other drivers and reactingand it still never gets old Ive driven myself off cliffssmashed into guardrailsand decided to see what happens when you DO get into an accidentchuckle and nod at the destructionand then do it all over againwhich Ive played a few times and are loads of fun Buuuuuuttif youll excuse meI need to see what happens when I take a 3 wheeled unstable vehicle over jumpI am currently a traffic crash investigator for a Sheriffs Department in the US Not only is this game funit has the potential to be a great tool in the field of traffic crash reconstruction The physics engine hands down is VERY close to the real thing Part of my job consists of taking real world crash datareconstructing and mathematically remodeling crash and vehicle dynamics That saidnot only is this game simulator really extremely funit has the potential down the road to aid law enforcement in the reconstruction of fatal crashes Similar programs that take raw physics data and convert them to 3D renderings such as this one can go for upwards of 5 Although Beamngdrive is not to the level of forensic softwareit could be with some tweaking and insightbut this isnt the full game and is to be expectedequationsetcand you could possibly license a professional versionwhich could spell big money Some type of mode to enter real world vehiclesmanipulate vehicle weightsbe able to place them on a road at certain angles and certain speeds etc would be awesome I can tell you already that the game in its current state will yield crash results in the same ballparkvery close to the real worldInterested in Sim Racing  It has you coveredI can keep going Though I havent full understood this sandbox myself because there is so much to dobut even thenI highly recommend it because it is one of a kind and it does almost everything with finesseBiggest tips for new players who may be bored quickly Explore the menus BeamNGdrive is more than just crashing cars By exploring every single menu and sub menus inside of those menus on the sidebar you open up A LOT of possibilities From changing almost every component in your carto making awesome replaysa bit of roleplayingand setting up car chasesmaybe from YBRor Mighty Car Vidsand Muyebe it theyre not ready for a full releaseor for copyright reasons they cant be included There are tons of extra mods on BeamNGdrives official websiteDrove into a wallThis game is THE best driving simulator i knowyou askyou will break your suspension oh dont worry you can still finishbut youll have to suffer the consequences of your decisions or you can restart the scenario and try again with a fresh car to get a clean run as the youtuber Jimmy Broadbent said in beamng compared to so many other racing gamesthe car actually feels like an object you have to look aftertarmac rallytrack racingdriftingderbyoff roaddragor simply just cruising in a comfy road car at comfy speeds there is a career mode i have tried a little and intend to look into more with nice fun challenges that are not conventional of your typical racing sim there are a lot of scenarios you can choose fromlike classic dirt rallying i really love dirt rally and its really good in this gamepolice chasescool stunts like in moviesdeliveriesraces some light and breezy and some very challenging and sooooo much more i have played 2 hours so far and havent even remotely scratched the surface of this games contenta highly detailed and very huge map of a countryside in italy with very long serpentine roadsthat go through the mountains and seaside with three cities to explore and drive in and countless dirt and gravel roads to put your rallying skills to the test there is Industrial sitewhere you can practice your driftingrallycrossderby there is east coast usa where you can cruise on the highway and make cool police chase scenarioseven so that they made most of them accessible on their website and in game you can download mapscomponents for your carsnew carsand so much more i recommend getting the nurburgring map mod you can find it in the repository under the name ksnord its a super realistic FREE and SCANNED map of the legendary nurburgring circuit in the nurburg area in germany most of the fanmade mod maps in this game looked really good to me and its fun to see such a loving and passionate comunity in a racing game also look up beammp which is a multiplayer mod for the game it is being constantly looked after and updated by their creators and so far i find it really fun doing some roleplay with peopleracing and cruisingIf my 5 and counting hours on this game doesnt already say itread thisan acurate one It requires a good computer to run most of the timebut its so worth it If you like drivingbreaking thingsor wondering around aimlessly in vast and detailed maps in a carthen this game is for youI crashed into a school busGraphicsSUPER fun  After finding out about thisI went on a search to find any free games that could do what this thing could do  Nothing  ThenI took off the free filterand still nothing compared This game is a true simulation of physicsand it does it extremely well and accurately  The next best thing would be rigs of rodsbut even that doesnt come anywhere close to the power and freedom you have in BeamNG  Highly recommendedim a simple mani see car go boom and it makes me happyDriving off cliffs is therapeutic DIFFICULTY 
1,November 018  With Space Industry Rocketry Upgrade the late game has become longer and relatively harder The amount on content the game has nowand the time one can put into it is well worth the moneyyes you should buy the game The pace is now smootherslower and the research tree deeperwhich adds both the ease to learn early on and the difficulty to progress later Beyond the efforts of survivalthe end goals are ones own See how many cycles you last Wish to have the best things for your suplicants or do it againbetter this timetelling you the game is uninteresting What puts people offI assumeis the midgame Starting and setting up base is the fun part but is hardly a challengewhich is why most people enjoy it The midgamepresentlyis where the base needs planning and strict management to survive  where everything starts to fall down a spiralprobably which is where people have a falling out The difficulty spikes during this mid periodwhere resourcestasks and dupes need to be managed if you wish to go on further  where it becomes a niche genre  some people love itsome dont After this difficult and rather annoying periodthe game becomes a bit of a sandbox and you can let your creativity flourishwith advanced machineries and systems Bases evolve to their final formmostly sustaining themselves and an easier relaxed life for your dupesand honestlyif my life allowed itid play it a lot more The ai is a tad wonky but perhapsgoing out of early access will fix itfor mehas improvedno bamboozle710 hours playing this game currently  To put this in context I am a 40 year old professional  While most games I play keep me entertained for a week or so I always come back to oxywith the amount of time I have spent on it  This is not true though  I have never made it to the surface or to the lava at the bottom  The mid game is incredibly difficult  You go from being well positioned to just managing crisis after crisis   Eventually I just give up and abandon the colony and your dups only to try againbut I have faced the reality of the enevitable so many times  Highly recommend this game  Highly  I think I have spent about 3 cents a minute to entertain myself and I am still addictedand this was a HUGE helpis to climb to the top first  Space is a vacuum and I dumped all my carbon out the trash instead of trying to process it which was taking all of my resources  This really was a game changer for me  Anyway Cyberpunk came out and I took a break for awhile but I will be playing this game againWith over 1000 hour into the gameI have to take the time to the leave a review for itbut aware of what your are jumping into There is a lotA LOT of things to learn in this game There will be a lots of restart and a new gamebut you will learn and progress more each time Think of it as Its more about the paththan the final destination  While playingcheck for tutorials online If you need helpcheck online The community is great Even if its on Early access Its now a

and many more Your reward A thrivingmaybe selfsustainingcolony Capable of exploring the cosmos and beyond You will face tons of different materials to dig through and managecreatures that can help or arm your fragile colonybut you assign them rolestask and priority You will need to level them up to reach further step in the game but also meet there requirement and deal with each of there little personalitythe visual is very appealing Animations are cute and well done Game is fluid on probably a lot of pcalthough once your colony gets bigger and biggeryou might need more power from your computereach layer you need to keep an eye on can be view as an overlay For example  You can see the temperature overlayyou can visually see hot and cold spot Same for germs or gas and liquidand

with the same battlecry that every player of Oxygen Not Included will utter at some point in their playtimeOxygen Not Included is just an awesome time sinkalthough I suspect its appeal is to a fairly narrow player baseand it remains quirky and adorable even while everything falls apartthough  You get to trade off how fast you want the game to go by how willing you are to take on new dupes  lots of dupes can get things done quickly sort ofeventuallybut can also easily tip your colony rapidly over into chaos and destruction  Keep your colony lean and mean and its easier to retain controlbut everything takes foreverin just the wrong placeand go Eatin timesystem planningtestingiterationidentifying problems as soon as possible and prioritizing work to deal with the most pressing issues while not forgetting the longer term  Reworkredesign is both inevitable and to be avoided as much as possible because there is nothing worse than finding a nasty flaw in one of your systems that will take another couple of hours to tear stuff down and rework to get around the flaw  And working around an existing mostly functional system to patch in upgrades is messy and finickyexcept they seem to be longstanding and just an accepted part of playing the game effectively  Fluid airlocks CO pits the different ways to manage critters and plants  a wild critter or a wild plant may be much more

negotiating tricky environments  and how you can create vacuum conditions through such excavation how vacuum works  the perfect insulator because they didnt model radiation for some reason the weird pseudo physics in generalwhere things kind of seem like theyre roughly modelled on real physicsbut with major weirdnessbut for a variety of reasons once you get into the rocketry phase I just found it to lose a lot of the vibrancy that marks the earlier parts of the game  You arent really facing survival challenges by the time you get to that pointits just about scaling up your systems to deal with massive resource sinksand that just gets a bit tedious  I kind of feel that the systems that are there at the end now dont really fit  there is a tier of resources and technology at the end that you cant really use as part of the survivaloptimization game because youve basically run out of motivation at that point  The survival pressure needed to be maintainedand getting access to resources of other planets feels like it should obviously have been an extension of the core game where you have to set up little miningexploration bases on the other planetoids with even harsher environmentallogistical conditions and deal with having very limited supplies that you can send via the rocketsbut otherwise make do as best you can with the resources on the remote planetits a fantastic game for the most partand its way too easy to get caught up in it and have it haunting your thoughts at all times of the day and night  EnjoyMy colonists are starving because my plants arent growing because my greenhouse is getting too hot because my cooling system isnt running because Im running low on power because my oil power plant isnt running because I dont have enough oil because my oil well isnt running because it doesnt have enough water because the water pump is submerged in hot steam instead of water because Im not cooling the steam fast enough because my cooling system isnt running because my aquatuners are overheating because they arent made out of steel because I cannot make steel because making it heats up my colony too much which would be fine if my cooling system was operationalif you can make a selfsustaining colonyput it on your job resumeI have played this game religiously since it was in alpha and my best friend gifted it to me There were years where I played this game almost exclusively Youll get frustrated at the things you dont know and have to learn about the game when you start and youll often wonder what it is that your dupes are even thinking when they do stupid things but I cannot recommend a game more than this There is so much to learn and explore in this gameit is crazy Ive put over 5k hours into it though and thought it was about time I left a reviewI am an Engineer by trade Never have a played a game that works your problem solving brain to this extent in abstract ways If you count in the hours Ive watched other people play this game when Im unable to play myself sometimes while Im at work  then I am probably around the 500 hour mark currentlymost of which you have brought on yourself but I promise you that once you get into the swing of things there is hardly a more rewarding and entertaining game on the market today This is a game that is well worth full pricebut if you can get it 50 off its just a no brainer

became mired in the details of waste water disposal and treatment I built a massive tank to hold the water with a pump to extract it I agonized over the thermal properties of my pipes so I could transfer the liquid for treatment and somehow kill its germs with extreme temperatures while in transit Then I had to figure out what to do with that heat so plants in my greenhouse wouldnt dieor even worseI accidentally melt an ice biome and flood my base Eventuallyafter much trial and errorI had a sustainable water treatment process that recycled my duplicants own waste Then the Stinky I left on a ledge above and forgot about peed in the water and ruined everythingthe possibilities are truly endless And while the game variables arent grounded too much in realitythis game provides a great way for amateurs to appreciate real world physics and materials science I dont know much about the history of the development of the gamebut its amazing this even exists I hope the game continues to evolve and perhaps even gets a sequel It has dominated my steam library ever since I bought itwho needs other games with this much to doahh fuckI messed up the placement of a room that could easily be fixed with a bit of effortbut do it RIGHT this timeI messed up the layout of my spacefarer modulebut do it RIGHT this itmeThis game is a poster child for early access gone rightI dont ever write

other than trying to design a system and I cant really argue against that I just want to give a personal positive review for those folks that enjoy designing systems just for the sake of it this game is really great for that For me it scratches a bit of the Factorio itch but in its own charming way The devs are also adding new dynamics to the game fairly regularly which is encouraging Price point seems fair as well
1,You might be wondering why the countless hours in this game Wellwonder no more It was all due to the garbage grinding that took placebut it is infested with PayToWin Squads Credit card swipes all the way What use is there when every timeyou are going against Lamborghinis or Bugatti Veyronswith your basic 4 wheeler My basic 4 wheeler has players that I grinded heavily for by raking up those weekly rank rewards Decent TOTWsObjectivesand standard cards Total squad value  5 millionbut this is nothing compared to the other squads out there All that with 3 months of grinding Utter garbagethe game concept is  PayToWin or GrindTillDeathwith no deserving benefits whatsoever Playable only the first 3 months upon release if you use the GrindTillDeath concept That is because most of the squads are ONLY half done with the nonstop credit card swipes Beyond the 3 monthsglhf as the PayToWin Squads would have fully infested the game Every match that you playwould be them Somebody call the Pest Exterminatorcan you guys do something and be a proper competitor rather than being a baby at the sidelines You guys remind me of Hazards glorious impact at Real Madridit is a special day for someone

1,So should you get Baldurs Gate 3 If you really like Larian RPG games then probably yeahits a lot like their other games with a few major differences that might make you not enjoy the gametheyre based on 5E DD so theyre based on your classso your class selection is very important and youll need a balanced partylike Ray of Frost leaving ice beneath the feet of enemies and similar spells leaving fields on the ground that debuff or damage targets Ray of Frost is the biggest offender since slipping on ice ends your turnor your opponents turn making it the best mage cantrip for its RNG valueso far it seems like it has nothing to do with the other Baldurs Gates game besides the fact youre trying to get to Baldurs Gate to some degree but cant because monsters are fucking around in the countrysideas per usual Your character is also not a Bhaalspawn so Im not sure why they called it Baldurs Gate 3 when more accurately it should be like Baldurs Gate The Mind Flayering or something similarmine is fairly powerful and with the game ready Nvidia Driver the game runs smoothhowever textures kinda pop in weirdlythe game is in Early Access so its expected that the graphics arent full up to snuff yetit feels pretty good they got the 5E stuff in game to work really well and they added in special weapon attacks that make a big difference The Combat is deadlybut fair and you have loads of options to subvert encounters and crush your enemies Beyond that its not a big murder hobo affair either you do murder many things but I was surprised when I actually found some friendly monsters whod normally be murder hobo fodder Larian also wisely shot the alignment system of DD in the head behind a shed which was a good move since 5E doesnt really use that system very much anyways I find the AI however has a hard time handling stealth attackswhere I can sometimes get three free stealth attacks against monsters if I have my rogue hidden wellperhaps thats a bug or a reward for good positioning I cant sayno spoilersor at the very least treat you as a decent person I read some reviews after playing where reviewers complained that the party ALWAYS hated you But I only ever felt that one NPC hated meand now after a few hours into the game they talk to me as an ally and have even confided into me about some of their own secrets making me feel like its something that could easily become a true friendship One praise Ill give it that others will call negative is that some persuasion options might not be good ideas Please use your common senseyou might not want to tell sensitive things about your situation to certain people or even if you pass your check it might have a negative outcomein this case passing the check makes a really bad situation a bit less bad You also get special dialogue options due to some special magical powers you get rather early on in the game though Ill avoid calling them by name because that could be a spoiler which give you OP persuasion options that you cannot failhowever I like that the game implies that by using these powers you can get some negative backlashthese options even let you learn extra details about certain characters that share your condition though I have opted not to use them since I assume it will worsen my relationship with the character The only downside of conversations is that in single player you cant change who is talking to perform skill checks I had a Dex check in a conversation to pick a lock but couldnt let the rogue do his job to pick the lock There was also lacking a dialogue option of me just using the key I had on me to unlock the shackles the guy was trapped in The animations in conversation are also fairly stiff looking and your character only has a few stances they taketheyre kinda annoying and I hope they add more variety to themyou get a large area to explore and the characters are varied and the story interesting if a bit high fantasythough I feel Baldurs Gate was also High FantasyI will say Im not a fan of certain named characters existing in the world like Volo who I foundbut I was happy to learn you can also mindlessly murder such refferences and rob their dead caracasses with only minimal consequences I bribed a guard like 00 gold after I killed Volo and stole all of his swagit was super worth Id recommend murdering Volo in every game hes in  Beyond that Id say the game is on the right track to be a cool RPGthough the game requires patience if you want to avoid murder hoboingthe game gives most characters even goblins actual names which makes talking to them and learning their secrets worthwhileId recommend talking to as many people as your patience can handle to solve problems nonviolently since some fights are nearly unwinnable Also dont forget to scout around with your rogue to find shenanigans to cheese encounters and make sure youre not about to walk into a hornets nestI can finally play DD alone because I dont have friendsI am an RPG enthusiast and I can say this game is just the bestright up my alleyI played the original Baldurs Gate games when I was a kid with my dadhe loved all the old school PC gamesand Im really glad I get to play another oneand so far this game hasnt disappointed meI know hed love itOnly 8 hours in and Im loving itbeware thoughif youre expecting a remastered BG1 you will be sorely disappointed This is Larians version of Baldurs Gate and it is therefore very similar to DivinityIm giving this a positive reviewbecause its one of the best games ive ever playedbut do yourself a favor and be patientGonna be really cool in like 3 yearsb Well this game has alot of faces b On one side its a Larian game and many people wanna compare it to i Divinity Original Sin  i in hopes it will become some kind of spiritual succesor to it On a different face this has i Baldurs Gate 3 i in the titleso people look back to the old BG games and try to compare it to thatBut the truth isb BG3 is none of those byoull recognize alot of things from it in here This is why some people are inclined to dislike BG3 at firstNarratively and MechanicallyNarratively and Mechanicallyand from what i hear Larian plans to have all or at least as close to all of them as possible at launch Which is awesome From the Player perspectiveits so refreshing to just be able to boot up a game and play a DD 5e campaign without having to schedule meetings with others and run a 7 hour session Dont get me wrong I still do thatbut its so cool to have that experience without all the effort that you have to go through in real life lolBG3 is also b greatb The RPG elements are so well definedCombat is fluid and takes pace just as if you were using Roll0 or Pen and Paper well its quite faster since you dont have multiple people thinking over what to do Animations and Graphics are wonderful to look at And the narrative its delivered in such a cinematic way Also something to noteCombat can be very difficultbecause most of the enemies you see even if they are taken from the DD lore are alot more powerful than in DDlikeyou see goblins casting Bless and using Action Surge n stuffwhich made me laugh Goblins are scary hereBG3 can give you 30 to 40 hours of gameplay PER CHARACTER you makethats if youd like to try more than one classand you probably will And though content will be the samethere are multiple ways of dealing with the same situations you facewich is something not many games offerbut nothing gamebreaking And the game still has plenty of room to improvewell see where Larian takes this game tobut its looking good so farand if you can spare the cash and cant waitget it nowyou wont regret it either way bCan throw children At other childrenYou know those reviews saying oh its just Divinity Original Sin  with the DD rules Wellthey are antiquated Larian put out the game in a very earlyexperimental stageand since they built the engine starting from the DOS onethere were of course going to be a lot of similarities that didnt mesh And lo and beholdLarian did and still does listen to their fanbase People were rightly saying that jumping was obnoxiousit got fixed People were rightly having problems with dicerollsthey got fixed People were rightly saying that backstab shouldnt give advantageand it got fixed I have never seen this level of prompt response and engagement with the communityit sounds fantastic both in music  and voice actingand the whole experience is just fantastically immersivenot to mention the characters OhI have a crush for about half the NPCs aroundYes some parts need expanding or reworkingand yes it hurts that we cant yet go beyond Act Onebut holy guacamole is this a good start and a better continuation Hearty recommendationFull disclosureI worked on the original Baldurs Gate series BG TotSC through BG ToB and Neverwinter Nights as a designerscriptor  I was hands on with scripting questsenemy encounterssetting up cinematicscreating itemsspellsmonstersplacing them and so on I’m not sure how best to review BG3 in Early Accessand I’m trying to keep in mind the full release is at least a year away I also feel like Ive been in enough EABetas to realize some things wont change much from how they are now I mention working on the originals so you’re aware I have some bias with the series Believe meit’s not worth mentioning to put up with trolls and insults otherwiseI have certain expectations OtherwiseBG Insert Subtitle Name would have been preferred But the choice to include “3” means something to meso Ill treat it as suchbut it doesnt feel like Baldurs Gate to me Pathfinder Kingmaker and Pillars of Eternity feel more similar to what Id expectincluding trying to include a great storymemorable charactersquestsmany choices in how you portray your character and approach thingsand a mix of realtime w pause DD combat The lack of a realtime combat component has thrown me off from feeling like this is supposed to be a sequel It was a defining part of BG at the timewhether or not you like the featureclasses and races There are a lot of choices availablewith a lot more to come which is great I hope there’s eventually more variety in faceshair personallyAbilitiesSkillsSpellsMonsters and so on  Againits not a BAD thingand its enjoyablebut it feels like Im playing a new Divinity Game set in Forgotten RealmsI’m just saying what it is and how the gameplay feels I personally enjoy both stylesbut its not what Id expect from a game labeled as a Baldur’s Gate sequel The fact is it feels like Divinity more than other CRPGs and that’s thatmost likely one of which you will NEVER use Party size is limited to 4and you probably wont want to double up with your own protagonists choice in class Initial impressions are there are a lot of angrybossy people in this worldnot arguing if it’s a good or bad thingbut it’s noticeable at the moment how they’re portrayed It constantly feels like my party is disappointed in my actions if I try to help peopleand I’ve only played a few hours into the game I have no other choices of who to bring alongso yes it’s a little frustratingsome morally questionablesome valorous choices and so on near the beginning  So far it feels as though everyone is out for themselvesand its a bit hard to like them as a resultThey are more memorable for something afflicting them vampirismtime bombangeretc than a personality This might change over time of coursebut that’s my initial impressionlearning about them and their personalities and having a lot of options for party make ups Choice and variety were always important Telling me they’re “supposed” to dark doesn’t help or change the fact it feels like there should be more options in classes and personalitieswhich I’m not sure will changea companion died before I’d even met themthanks to enemies ganging up on him It was interesting and I’m glad that conversations changed due to their and others death If not for another play through thoughI’d have completely missed out on a companion due to RNG without even knowing itand I had no way to help them in time I’d have no choice for my party at all if I didn’t want to double up on classesarcana checks can help you decipher languages you may not knowand rolls for intimidationpersuasion and so on are included in dialogue options I’m happy for this featureas it makes me feel like those skills seem to matter herenot so muchand while Im sure they want to maintain some mysteryI guess I dont understand the choice yet Larian has already made some amazing popular gamesand if they wanted to go down their own Forgotten Realms story I’d look forward to it Whether its in storygameplaycharactersinteractionschoices thoughit doesnt feel like there’s any continuation from the original games currently It might be there at some pointI dont knowbut at this time I havent seen ittaking the game in their own direction That’s completely finebut let’s face itsome people were hoping to find more of a continuation of BG1 with a similar playstyleand not so much a DD version of Divinity Whether or not you like one style of gameplay over the other isn’t the point really Reviews should give information and opinions for those still deciding if they should spend money on this gameand not something similar to Divinitywould be disappointed At this timeYes Saying the game play is better for you doesn’t change the fact that it is what it is Some will love it and some will be disappointedwhile others don’t mind either way You should all make up your own mind at the end of the day and enjoy the games you likebut if I’m honestI was hoping for more of a change from how it feels from Divinity I can look past itbut I know others won’tor don’t want to Even with DD rulesstatsspells and naming conventionsI barely notice a difference truthfullywhile annoyingstill feel uniquenot generic and there’s enough there that I do want to learn more about them Spells and monsters look and act as expected from DD 5E There are some bugsand the game does need polish but it’s still very playable and enjoyable in Early Access If you want a full feature game thoughwith all the questsclasses and balanceId highly recommend you try to waitit is more alike to Divinity in spirit than to Baldur’s Gate though in my opinion So I struggle to feel as though it’s a sequel to Baldur’s Gate so far other than in name and knowing the city itself will make an appearance down the road That may change one daybut not today300 hours in and Im still finding new quests that Ive missed  New personal cutscenes with my player character and my companions  New dialogue and character development that I revealed by strengthening my relationships with my companions and gaining their trust I wasnt going to write a reviewI was going to just continue to enjoy my time in early access alone and with friendsbut playing as much as I haveI feel compelled to share my experience In all honestyI am beyond impressed Lets set early access aside for a moment because it has the customary visual bugs etc that one would expect However the story being told here in the world and especially between you and your companions is beyond top notch The dialogue in this game has made me laugh my ass off at timesand has also made me cry real heartfelt tears Anyone who enjoys story driven games and has the time to really dig in and get to know the characters in this game will be rewarded My advice is to take your time with it Save often Go back to camp and sleep often Make new races and charactersand make different choices to see how different one playthrough can be from another Take the time to gain trust between your companions and they will respond in kind If the first act is any indication of what the final product will besaying that I am looking forward to the full release is a large understatement Well doneLarian Well fucking done mates This is what an rpg should beReally loving this game even in early accesslevel 4 capand only Act 1 availablewith games like DOS showing how much they listenfrom first release to Patch 6 most recent at time of writing this  Larian have showed they will listen to the players and improve the game and the mechanics in so many waysthen youre likely going to be a bit disappointedand as the game continues I cant wait to see what more they add LARIAN IF YOU ARE READING THIS PLEASE ADD THE SHIELD SPELLwith the BardBarbarianPaladin and Monk yes I intentionally avoided artificer just for all you Eberon nerds out there And I am hoping we see some more subclass options for the existing ones TEMPEST CLERIC  OMG PLEASEas of Patch 6is still a very fulfilling experience and even in its current form has a great deal of replay value Because each character you create will have different strengths and weaknessesdifferent ability point distributiondifferent skill proficiencyand the fact that different classes can get different and classspecific dialogue options makes replaying this game actually something that I find myself wanting to doand not dreading I love you Fort Joy  but I wont miss rerunning youand can go in wildly different directions depending on what you choose to say    and how well you roll on your charisma check turnbased combat of DD 5th edand have meaningful feedback that actually gets taken on board and implemented by the Devs several suggestions I made almost a year ago have been added to the game  then doooooo itThis is my review of the Early Access of Baldurs Gate III Its gonna be a lenghty one so bare with me if you would I will be talking about individual parts of the game with my thoughts and if need be also add a ProCon for this version thus far Those of you who dont wanna read more you can just refer to that part of the review and conclusionbut since its Early Access with limited content there is always room for improvement as seen with other titles that Larian have worked onbefore finally getting to the gameplay side of it Itoowas apprehensive that this game was going to be Divinity Original Sin 3 and only Baldurs Gate in name There is some truth in this truly from some mechanics that are pulled from the DOS games to being able to pick up everything to being very colorful and comedic unlike the setting of Baldurs Gate which is supposed to be very groundeddark and grittyand started interacting with the worldthe charactersraces it felt like going back home to this wonderful world of Faerun So much lore strewn about in booksreferences to past events  familliar places made my thoughts about how it feels more like Divinity in a visual sense go away I am more narrative inclined than gameplay when it comes to preference in CRPGs  and I love reading lore so I explored every nook and cranny of the content that was available and tried my best to see every outcome possible by save scumming a staple as a CRPG veteran I would reckon to say I will not go into a Story gameplay section because this game is worth experiencing for yourself and if you have seen the trailers already that should be enough to tell you if you are interested in the story or notbecause I grew up on these games and it makes the combat way faster I understand the reason why they decided to go with turn basedbecause its a strength of theirs and you always try to build to your strengths ButDD tablet top is turn based so it makes sense for this to be that way I understand both sidesbut let me tell you why I wanted to avoid mostly every encounter in DOS because once you are engaged in combat with more than 10 enemies it will take over 1 minutes before you get to use your character again And unless you can attack multiple times based off your action points like you can in Divinity or Wasteland then you will be wasting at least 1530minutes depending on how long the fight is every single combat encounter If you have bad luck and you want to redo that fight or something else unfortunate happens that you dont want to you have to redo the whole fight Luckily they added a save system during combat which can be usedBUT its easily exploitableof coursean encumberance system I will never understand why this is still a thingit doesnt make the game fun when you CAN pick up so many things and yet you have to either send the extra items to Camp Stash or pass it a long to another companion Another thing with inventory is that the inventory is separated between characters so every time you want to give someone something you have to open  menus to do sobecause of these skill checks You specializing in a certain area and RNGdecides to give you three 1 rolls in a row on a 5 check mind you I have  proficiency in charismapersuasion and guidance on makes no sense to me I hope they tune this in the future to have a certain threshold I understand they want to do it like DD where there isnt a reload option in tabletopbut this isnt FUN at all I always choose social stats over combat ones in most situations because Id rather get more information than having to fight it out Even after building myself that way I STILL needed to reload countless times to get passed those persuasion checks I am proficient intoDAOME fans will love thisfeatsraces etcanimation bugsdialogue loopsquest bugsperformance issues everything goes in here due to being an unfinished game that is still being worked on and will be fixed with timebut keeping in mind that a lot of things have to be changed for balance sake and NO if you cant handle pretty much what I wrote in the CONS sectionThis is a turned based DnD game with RNG battles    I am 56 and new to turn based games as well as DnDyou can move freely  but once you engage in battle you move into static turn based mode   Battle mode can happen when you least expect it  Save often for this reason  If you are playing solo  you have a lot of inventory and spells to manage  If you are looking for a rush thru fantasy RPG  this aint itdesigned the battle graphics and wrote the enchanting luring music   make sure you keep them on the payroll  for sure  PURE TALENT and imagination  and has been my favorite creature fight so far  I only wish I could zoom the camera in closer to see the Harpys faceclawswingsskull necklace etcIve been playing DND for 41 years  Ive been playing computer DND since the Gold box games of the 80s  This is the best version of DND brought to the computer ever  Period  Its not even close  And its not even done  Dark Sun was my favorite prior to this  This game engine and all the potential it presents may replace pencil and paper DND in my life  Yeswith 3 friends its that good  This engine could be used to bring it all back in glorious 3d with top notch voice acting and animation  DarksunRavenloftDragonlanceevery moduleevery adventure and new adventures too  And its just getting started  Best thing to happen to the PC in yearsbAs an average playerI do not recommend BG3 in its early accessbbut this is one of those early access games that is truly still in development when they say it is I love that theyre taking this game seriouslyI cant wait to play the finished productand I want to support them to hopefully create the best DD video game ever But I dont have the time or the desire to replay the same content multiple times due to characterprogress wipesso for now Ill sit and wait patiently for the 10 releasebut many times when big games are deigned to be put out for early accessthe game is largely finishedand its rare for the developers to make core changes that drastically affect the final product Its mostly to generate hypeget free promotion from streamersand collect lucrative marketing data from its playerswhile occasionally turning out token bugs and balance hotfixes But in this casethey really do mean it is iin developmentisave file invalidationsstory changesand spoiling

1,PUT IT IN THE FREE TO PLAY SECTION NOONE KNOWS THIS GAME EXISTSsnorts line of coke So you know halo rightportal but with gunsA movement FPS that transcends movementbut the higher you go on the skill curve the more of your actual movement gets replaced with dipping in and out of portals So while its possible to sprint and fly around pretty fastyou quickly learn any movement outside of portaling is suboptimal this means the movement in the game turns into peeking angles rapidly by shooting portals in other words as the skill gets higher you and your targets move less and less and the angles themselves move via portal placement even the actual gunplay and dodging becomes very much secondary to angle and route selection or blocking so thats pretty weird for a movement shooter where so much of the fun traditionally comes from tracking and juking targets as they movebouncing ricochetingand various newtonian physics although there are a few gimmicky launches you can do by falling through portals at terminal velocity which is fun if not usually practical but this also doesnt make the game bad by any means theres still a high mechanical and tactical skillcap in portaling even if its minimal on the WASDside If anything this broadens the appeal to tactical shooter fans since theres an exponential amount of angles and positions to study and masterand also consolecontroller players since expert movement via portals doesnt require much complex inputs to achieve the way say strafe jumping or tap strafing does aim assist is very generous as welland how much the qualitybalance of the game depends on the quality of the map If the portal surfaces arent balanced well on a map it seems like it can really mess things up with a classical movement tech like bunnyhoppingyou can still move fast around a new map without being familiar with it but when it comes to portaling around quicklyyou really need to spend time studying angles and routes on a new map or else youll be very sloweven if you are already adept at swapping portalsbecause the flow and type of practice required is so drastically different as you move up the curveand might be a lot less or a lot more fun than

for the portalswould be a fantastic f2p halo clonemaps are designed with portal strategies and tactics in mind I wont go into specificsbut strategies can range anywhere from camping a safe side of the map and sniping enemies from a vantage point through your portal  to falling through a portal on the ground and using the momentum to catapult yourself right into the enemy team and shotgun blast their faces offas you cant see through enemy portals  only your own This singular gimmick enables this game to be played by a multitude of differentlyminded playersbut there is a ranked mode The gameplay has so many layers built into it that proplay Splitgate is probably an incredible experience to watch  and probably an equally incredible game to cast forand possibly more to be added TDM is a classicbut VIP and oddball are super fun and exciting to play Snipers and Shotties is a mode loved by many You either snipeor close the distance and shotty I encourage everyone to play every mode at least onceyou may ask Because I cant see anything to complain about In my eyes if you want a F2P shooter but youre tired of whats popular on the market right nowyouve got just the game right here Not everyone will like it Many people may become frustrated with the incredibly high learning curve and skill ceiling I believe the casual mode and portal mechanic allows even the worst of players to come up with ways to be impactful in matches Pleaseif youre reading this reviewgive the game a shot It cant hurt to try itThis game is like masturbation once you get grip of ityou just cannot stop iti hate my wifebreadquoteShould you play Splitgate Absolutely So far this has been a great game from what I played during the beta Most fun Ive had with a FPS in a long time And its free as wellquotestrategy is an important factor here but you dont ireallyi need it to win Having teammates who understand the portal mechanics are equally valuableperkspay to win elementsor cheesy abilities Every player has the same toolsso it all comes down to your skill at FPSs and your teams ability to strategizerehashed war gamesand crave a newarena style shooterwith a classic feelplay this one
1,Greetings from Bulgaria I am Vulkk or Alex and I have been playing SWTOR since one of its beta stages without breaks and time outs I would like to encourage you to give the game a try with this quick review belowwhile still being honest about the flaws of the game in its elderly ageand continue through the first digital expansions of the game up to level 60you could only subscribe for a month to get all of the story content unlocked forever for your account Howeveronce you approach the EndGameyou start feeling the limitations of the F2P model very hard Once you find out what it is like to play as a Subscriberyou may struggle to get back to Preferred status player the middle limitation level after your Sub expiresbut it shines in the group playespecially if you team up with guildies and have a voice chat available Be it casual or hardcoreraidingPvPingexplorationConquest  everything is more fun with friends in this game Play the class stories alone to immerse yourself fully into themthen join a guild or play with friends once you find yourself in the EndGame grindSWTOR struggles to offer continuously fresh and engaging content to some of the hardcore fans and veterans of the game I myself have been playing it since beta and have witnessed every single  updatechangebright moments and failures over the years Its a thing to considerbut if you are reading this reviewyou are probably wondering if its worth picking up the game YesabsolutelyThis is a great game for all Star Wars fansIve been playing this game for years and Im very happy to see it come to Steam I dont know exactly how many hours I actually havebut Im sure its well over 4000 Sometimes that is a mark of shameand sometimes that is a mark of pridethis is one of the greatest MMOs ever madebut that does not mean it isnt without flaws The content releases are few and far between but there is so much already here thats not necessarily an issuesometimes EA has been known to flex their cash shop muscle in annoying waysand I wont liethis community is one of the more toxic ones Ive been apart of There are some very good people who play and will give you the worldbut there are also a ton who will put you down for breathing the wrong way Turn chat off when youre not enjoying group content and youll probably be much happieryou will love this game and all of its branching paths Even after finishing the 8 class storiesthere are ways to play those stories differently on a second run Its entirely possible to lose yourself while creating alternate charactersand imothats a great thingthat is an important feature Bioware did not forget their hopeless romantics and perverts Just sayinga few bits of advicebyou get all current content permanently and that is a LOT of content After you do soif its only the access to content youre afteryou no longer need to keep subscribingmeaning you can access it on multiple characters You can do this by buying the Dromund Kaas or Coruscant stronghold its very cheap and placing the one you get in the mail anywhere inside of your room Noteyou may need to level your legacy a little bit When youre about to go over 1 million creditsstore it therepress Y They dont tell you to do this Make a legacygive yourself a last name for all your characters Do it ASAPbecause youll want to level that baby Its importantdont waste your time in the cash shop Everything in the cash shop you can get in the game without spending real money by simply farming credits There are manymanymany ways to farm quicklybut there is a guide by swtorista which explains it best Go find her and watch a bunch of her videosshes greatfinebut if youre not enjoying the storylines there is very little point to playing Dont skip the cutscenes the first time around Give this one a fighting chanceeven on free to play you can skip most of the side quests there are a ton of them Stick to the story and do all the heroics on every planet Youll get the gear you need and likely be appropriate levelyou can use that buff on other classes This is why some people can share all 4 buffs at once If youre enjoying the gameleveling each class type only 4BH  TrooperSW  JKAgent  SmugglerInq  Consular might be a decent goal to keep in mindcheck out swtoristas guidesshes an old gem and has a whole series dedicated to the Steam players coming in This game isnt terribly complicated to get into or even play especially for people who are familiar to MMOsbut they might help should you need itHaving played this game for nearly 1000 hours nowheres what I can sayyou still get access to 8 class storieswho take anywhere from 15 to 100 hours each depending on how fast you go through them and if you do side missions Then theres the usual MMORPG content4 man dungeons called flashpoints16 man raids operations and world bosses all with different difficulty levelsbut in an MMO Some class stories stand outlike the Bondesque Agent storyor the classic overpowered sith story of the warrior Whoever you areyoull find a story that suits your stylecoming from WoW and having also played Tera a lotdespite its agewith your own lightsaber and very cool armor set that you can customizeeven if it got simplified over the years from what I read Your class story will give you access to 5 companions and you can gather more By the time you reach where the SWtoR story is at nowyoull have a few dozens Companions can all be geared up with the oufits of your choice and story companions all interact with you and have different personalities and preferencesstill giving you access to more content and featuresso thats definitely worth it If you never subhoweveryour adventure will end shortly after the class stories which can easily give you up to 500 hours of fun if you do all 8you will not be able to hit max level and will be capped at 1 million credits which isnt that much once you start getting really into the game  edit  Upon reflectionI moved the subscription system from meh to goodpvp is quite engaging Everyone gets a built in pvp trinket in their kitand interrupt and a stun Its not incredibly balancedbut most classes should have one spec that works There is however a bad side to pvp in this gamepeople are toxic as fuck in ranked the most toxic community Ive encountered so farand Im warning you as someone who reached the highest level of PvP in quite a few mmos and played online games with a PvP mindset for the past 25 years first by griefing people in diablo 1 as a 10 year old kid and getting Gladiator a few times in WoW during college Yeah Im a boomeryoull want to get your item level to 06and anything you do in the world will drop gear near your current average item level This means that you could solo your way to a fully optimized set of gear Of courseif you party up and run group content this process will go faster Once you hit 06 max item level currently you can hoard those items and twink your fresh lvl 75 altsputting them in best in slot gear instantly This is either good or bad depending on the type of player you are If youre hoping to be one in a million in BiS gear because its locked behind hard raidsyoull be dissapointedbut dated I dont mind itas long as the game is responsive when I use abilitiesbut for some people it can be boring This game is no Tera  BDO as far as combat goesthats for surethe coolest armors and boy are they dope are all real money cosmetics Unless you want to shell out the credits and buy them from people who used real money in the first place Admittedlythe cash shop is probably whats keeping the lights on this gamewhile gearing is so easy its impossible to call it pay to winits definitely pay to get rich By spending 10 you can buy a store item that you can then resell for somewhere around 150 million creditswhich is quite a lotbut wont get you one of the best looking lightsabers that go for 500600 million credits or 50 on the store Againpurely cosmetic You could be using an ugly wooden lightsaber and it would do the exact same damage with proper modsIm  happy I picked this game up The last time I spent so much time on an mmo was in the better days of WoW SWtoR has its flawsbut its definitely an epic game with an insane amount of high quality content You should at the very least pick it up and run the class stories for free I havent even gotten through all of them yet eitherI have over 000 hours in the other version I love this game and have completed almost all of the content available You can definitely get the same amount of time or more out of this game If you need help getting startedI am willing to help Just leave your name and server in the commentsthen it is of benefit to sub for a single month But without subscription as long as you complete the main class quest and the planetary quest line you will easily be on track for leveling Also make sure to use your legacy bank for any money that you acquire while unsubbed as that is the only way you can transfer money to other characters on your account The legacy bank is uncapped also Subbing will also let you use artifact gear which is super important to the progression in the endgame I would suggest subscribing then picking that up with the cartel coins you are granted so you can enjoy the endgame betterI have played this game off and on since releaseI would guess 700 total hours or more  This game has had numerous updates over the yearsbut I will tailor this review to newer playersthis game in very welcome to newer playersbut I would suggest ignoring the general chat on starter worldsthis game is fair to play  Whether you sub or notmost of the pay options are cosmetic only  If you subscribe for a single monthonce you revert to free to playyou will be a preferred and keep a lot of the benefitsBeing a subscriber is my preferred way to play  You can level using only the class story and never have to grind sidequests to stay within level requirementsmost of the time you will end up being downleveled to the content as you will be over the max level for the region  The class stories are all fantasticand if you dont have to grind to keep upyou will feel like you have 8 full KOTOR quality gamesto include raids Operations and dungeons Flashpoints with an easy to use groupfinder and difficulty that allows all ranges of capable and experiences of playersmultiple ways to get involved in PVP to include matches of HuttballSpaceship combatworld PVP and ranked matches  The ranked stuff can get cutthroat and is best experienced with a group of players you knowused mostly for cosmetic purchases  2  Sub for at least a month    Get into a guild most have already unlocked the 10 experience boost  I highly recommend my own guild of courseImperial Army on Starforge Serverbest group of players I have ever played with accross all my many years of many games wwwimperialarmyorg   and 4  Experience all the classes to at least level 20 before choosing your main eventually you are going to want to experience all the class storiesand being subscriber will allow you to do that without breaking up the continuity of lore too muchI have over 10000 hours playing this prior to it being released on Steam Ive played it on and off for the past 10 years Its unfortunate that its only just now being released on Steam after all this time as I dont know how much more I will continue to play it I loved itbut at some point I dont know if I could put in another 10000 hours It still gets updates and new contentfor anyone new to the gamethere is a massive ton of content to exploreand dont be turned off by it being an MMO For players who prefer a single player experience there is still 100s of hours of quality content that can be done alonefriends optionalor a mix of friends and companions PVP is optional and completely avoidablesound effects and music are movie quality and fit easily into the Star Wars universe This is quite possibly the game with both the most quality and quantity of voice acting ever created A huge portion of the games 200 million dollar budget was spent on voice acting and music production and it showsbut its still really good looking with the options turned upand its fairly low on system requirements so even people with older systems can get it runninglightdark and so on variablesfully decorated at the cost of billions in game and years of effort with dozens of friends to unlockthe game is Free to Play so you can go ahead and at least try it for yourself There is an optional monthly subscription and it will greatly enhance your fun and is needed to unlock some end game post class story contentbut you do not need it to start with and can easily see for yourself if you are willing to invest more into the gamebut this is purely cosmetics There is no paytowin and it can be completely avoided Most cosmetics from the Hutt Cartel can also be purchased from other players through the market for ingame creditsgive it a trywould you consider following my curator pageurlIm 55 years old this year This one is good for Star Wars fans of all agesOne of the best single player story MMOs out there FYIthis is a review from a mostly solo player viewpoint Ive been playing this game very on and off since day 1so Ive seen how its changed and progressed over the years Unlike other MMOsthis one has only gotten better with age There is literally hundreds of hours of single player story contentwith solo dungeons and raids for you to do in case youre like me and enjoy playing solo If youre like me and stopped playing WoW bc of various reasonsI can recommend this game very muchbut there is an emphasis on player control By that I meanyou can have a handful of companions that join you and be your tankdpsor heals You also can heal yourself at any timewhich makes solo content fun Im still shocked at how all the non force classes play so well and fit into this SW story so well I personally like the Smuggler and Bounty Hunter classes the most You get your own shipbaseand crew that you can deck out how you like4 Empireand all have their own 20 to 0 hour storydepending on how much side content you do Choices matter and can affect the game in smaller ways The game makes you feel like youre the champion of each class You start small then get bigger and bigger in the story  If youre wanting KOTOR then this is what you need to play The story is a sequel to KOTOR 2 looselyso youll see certain characters reappearing or being mentionedbut youre very limited with what you can do if you dont pay Others have said thisbut its best to sub for just 1 month and then you get put on a preferred status even if you arent paying anymoreso you still have access to certain features that F2P never subbed cant use The Cartel Market is their cash shopbut theres no P2W features Its almost all cosmeticsmountsboosters But all of these can be still purchased in the in game trade market for high prices But its up to you The game is also new player friendlywith giving you a lot of early tutorials and goodies to show off what you can do right now and at higher levelsI think in 2021 SWTOR is up there with FF14 in terms of single player content I dont do any PVP or hardcore raidingso I cant comment on that part If youre jonesing for KOTOR realistically youre never going to get itbut this game is about as close to it as well ever see Just do like me and play it solo and just pretend the other players arent there Its a MMO that people play for the storyYou can enjoy this game without paying a cent because you level extremely fast now Understand that if you start FreetoPlayyou arent going to accumulate wealthuse purple items artifactand you will be walking for a while You will be given EVERYTHING you needtherefore you do not need purple items or millions of credits When you finish one or two characters and want to continuepay for one month to get preferred status The Chapter content that unlocks with a Subscription is vast and worth the one month of subscriptionbut play one class before you decide I played this in 2012 and left it shortly after finishing one class I was shocked that some of the bugs still exist 10 years later but the game itself is greatStar Wars the Old Republic is a game that has been around for eight years nowbut it was never able to shake that bad reputation from its early days Even as of nowpeople are asking if the game is deadthe game is most definitely worth playing in 2020experiencing the story firstthe fault was not completely with the SWTOR Developers Lucasarts closed Star Wars Galaxies five days before the game’s launchso Galaxies fans who wanted to continue as they had were vastly disappointed And for several yearsthere were still people playing SWTOR who complained that the game just wasn’t Galaxiesin 2020there’s a LOT of end game There are currently 0 Flashpointswhich are fourperson quests for players to run through together There are also currently 12 Operationswhich are 816 player quests with lots of difficult bosses And both Flashpoints and Operations have multiple difficulty settingsthere are five maps for teambased PVPand doing well in these allows players to go into Ranked PVP Doing well in Ranked PVP allows players to get onto the SWTORCOM leaderboardwhich gets updated every two hours And if you keep the top spots until the end of the seasonyou get ingame rewardsyou take on the role of eight class stories across two factionswith four stories per faction And these are widely considered the best stories in the gameplayers head into the faction stories that are Rise of the Hutt Cartel and Shadow of Revan before heading into Knight of the Fallen Empire and Knights of the Eternal Thronewhich sets up the storyline going forward In Knights of the Fallen Empireyour character becomes the leader of an Alliance of specialists and Force users in their attempt to bring down the Eternal Empirebut now with the ability to sabotage your original faction This means that there are four possible stories instead of just the two faction stories now loyalist Republicsaboteur Republicloyalist Empireand saboteur Empirethere’s a wide assortment of armors and weapons to craft And thanks to the Outfit Designeryou can keep multiple specific looks available to you and still keep your up to date armors with your highest stats possible And even though it’s not part of the game right nowthe developers plan to eventually add weapons to the outfit designerbut the game also offers many opportunities to shape the stories as you see fit In addition to the previously mentioned loyalistsaboteur storylines that came from Onslaughtplayers can play a Light Side or Dark Side characterskill or let certain NPCs liveand depending on the classhave multiple endings For examplethe Sith Inquisitor can have one of  Sith titles given to them based on their alignment Light SideDark Side and Neutral And given the current “commit yourself to one side fo the Force” systemthe Neutral titleonce a painis easy to getand the best part is that you don’t need to spend any money to experience most of it In 2012the game went to a free to play modeland with the release of Onslaughtthat gave free players access to more of the game Free players now have access to 60 levelsup from 50up to the Shadow of Revan expansionup from the vanilla gameand can now have access to 1 million creditsup from 200000 for completely free players and 50000 for preferred players And if new players want to see what comes after thatthey only need to subscribe for 1 month to permanently unlock everything up to the current expansionas well as all content to come with that expansionyou’ve got nothing to lose but time for checking outIve never really enjoyed playing MMOsand Ive tried bMANYb of them Most of the time those games were Pay2Winwith bland combat mechanics and uninteresting story with generic quests such as kill  big ugly monsters or Im too lazy to harvest a flower I really need to brew my potiongrab it for meand so on4 Republic It took me around 15 hours to complete the PROLOGUE of my first classwithout even exploring a lot or doing a bunch of side quests And let me tell youthe story is fantastic and your choices matter Its a BioWare game after alltons of different playstyles and an unbelievable amount of content to keep you busy for a long whileGreetings from USA I am Walter or Fat gringo and I have been playing SWTOR since one of its beta stages without breaks

three years of my life playing WoW wish Id been playing this insteadThe gameplay may be dated but this is the best Star Wars experience Ive ever had It tells sprawling stories that the filmsbooksshowsand other games couldnt hope to capture It makes the galaxy far far away feel grander and more epic in scope than ever beforequestsand raidsnot just because of the stories it tells but the stories I have to tell of my journeys through the Old RepublicTreat it as a singleplayer with coop options The storylines and dialogues are amazing and there is ton of people willing to help youafter allmost of us dont want to see such amazing game dieFor free you get 8 awesome base stories and some good side storiesall with classic BioWare choices F2P players also get to play some DLCsnot the best ones those are behind the sub but they are still good Wouldnt say that SWTOR is as good as the original two KOTOR gamesbut its enjoyable and gives back the Star Wars RPG feelingbut its nothing that will make the story quality lowerbut they dont affect the funfactorA MMORPG with more single player  co op story content than many single player RPGs The MMO stuff is there too The graphics are a bit dated and cartoonybut with KOTOR  nowhere in sight this is probably the way to go if you want to play a Star Wars RPG Plusyou can play on the Imperial side this timewhich is always a good thing

1,Backstory   I started with MS Flightsim on an amber screened IBM clone in 987 It took several disks to loadand I would go make coffee and  drink most of it before it would be loaded and ready to play Looking backit was simply atrocious It had no graphics to speak ofran at less than 5 fpsand used a keyboard as input In shortit was the equivalent of flying a very stubborn turkeyI mused  this will be real One day places will look like it does in the real world One day planes will feel like planesnot just an illusion of something clearly being tortured on a screen37 years laterone day is herelike the fact that the frame rate is inconsistentand it slows down substantially around massive built up areasor that the drone camera system is somewhat cumbersome and flight planning could be a lot more user friendly when adding or reordering waypoints But these are minor And  though I am sure they will be ironed outI could also live with the game as isbecause all the rest is just so far ahead of anything else Ive ever seen It not just greatits phenomenaltrying my best for years and yearsand Im still rubbish at it Howeverthis simulator is a quantum leap from the ones before I can actually land every time without crashing when realism is maxed out  The actual simulation of flight systems and avionics has been vastly improvedmaking it so much easier to hand fly aircraft  than in previous iterations  It actually feels like you are flying a planenot a simulation  It actually feels like you are in your hometown when flying over it And no  that house you are flying into looks nothing like your actual house In fact it could be mine  makes me so unbelievably happy It gives me untold pleasure to admit Its finally here and its better than I ever imagined possiblewhenfor 6I can go fly anywhere in a faithfully recreated virtual copy the world Fly over a place and exclaim This actually does look like it does in real life How ungrateful would I be If I lamented the hours and hours it took to downloadwhenby the end of itthe whole world exists on a little setup in the corner of my lounge  Honestlysome peopleand its simply mind blowingIll post a full review later but just wanted to warn anyone out there that after buying the game you download a 6MB launcher The game itself is a 9GB download from that launcher The problem isthe launcher being open appears to being counted as play timeso just a heads up if you were thinking to return it if you dont like it Butbased on everything Ive seenits clear that this is going to be a phenomenal simbut just wanted to let people knowfor those of youlike mewho are installing this to a secondary drivenote that your main drive C\ will need to have at least 84GB free as it uses a Rolling Cache thats located in AppData\Roaming\Microsoft Flight Simulatorat least in my caseI came back and it looked as though the launcher had frozen at 5 that’s where I left it when I locked my PC I exited the launcher and reopened Microsoft Flight Simulator via Steam to learn it had fully installed Important thing to noteI didn’t put my PC to sleep overnightI just locked it and made sure it wouldn’t automatically put itself to sleep by changing the sleep setting in Windows SettingsIm a sport pilot so fly in real lifeheres what I can tell everyone else about VR and MSFS22  Using a reverb G2 and flight yoke and throttleor it has to many levelsor my airport is not depicted just right  but when you step back and look at the big picture this is a gigantic leap forward for flight simmersI can tell you that the at times tonight for moments I literally lost reality and felt like I was flying in real lifethe sim can be that realisticof course the windnoiseand vibrationsturbulence are missing from the feedbackbut in VR it immerses the senses even more making those points above even less noticeable while flyinghow good the sim is compared to real life and again while it would be easy to complain about various things  wow a jump forward for flight simmers There are times while in the traffic pattern Ill turn downwindbaseor on final and look down and out the window and I get that same feeling as real flyingI literally forget Im in the sim because the terrain and building match up close enough to trick the mind Performance wise it may be running better in VR than on my triple screensstill to be determinedmany have hangersFBOsor other vital landmarks missing Example at airport 2a the FBOone set up of public hangersand Tuskegee Airman hanger is missingnot sure how because that is certainly big enough to show up on maps The closer to real life they can make this that much more immersive its going to be for those who have flown over areasspecific to VR very impressed The fact it can make me forget Im at a computer at times and not in the actual plane is something no flight sim as done before I highly recommend this and can tell you from a visual perspective its highly realistic and in VR that much more immersivehad to cancel gamepass and buy the game on steam in order to play it the way I wantedI am a reallife private pilot This game is not only beautifulbut accurately represents a large portion of my time in the air The detail within this sim truly allows for realistic VFR flights to be performed like never beforeespecially when coming in on final at an uncontrolled airfieldbut more than enough to get you started on your journey through FS22Before you buy the game hereId recommend that you try it through the Xbox Game Pass where you can get it for  a month on your first monthotherwise 6 a month If you download it through Xbox Game Passyou can also use the downloaded files through the launcher on the Steam version if that is how you want to go about it later on The sim itself is fantastic and I feel that it was well worth the wait Ill update this with a full review later on when I get more hands on experience with the simulatorI wanted to give my inputs on how I feel about the simulatoris simply the best weve had in a flight simulator For the longest timeclouds rendered in simulators like P3D or XPlane  were 2D and flat albeit now P3D has TrueSky which significantly improves their clouds but with FS22we are finally able to get an overhaul to one of the most significant problems in flight simulationthese issues will be sorted out with their weather provider meteoblue The gusts however are great with the frequency being shown and able to be adjusted Gives the wind a more alive feelit felt as if you were on rails The aerodynamics are not comparable to XPlane  which I feel has the better flight model though it does feel too exaggerated Flying in the third person camera however feels kind of arcadelike which is dislike but I enjoy flying more in the cockpit than I do flying in the third person camera I feel the aerodynamics will need some work done on them as planes tend to be tail heavy in my experience with them pitching up too much upon touchdownmissing features in the GPS systems such as in the G where it can make it difficult or near impossible to fly with them on networks like PilotEdge or VATSIMand just general performance issues They look really nice but dont have the greatest functionality but they are just default aircraft so it is to be expected that not everything works in them They should howevertry to make really good avionics Kind of like how XPlane  has a fully functional GGNS43 and GNS53 avionics systems as they work really well and are included by default Most payware planes will end up using the default avionics and having strong base avionics is a must in a simulator in my opinionglass cockpits suffer hard on performance The game really needs you to have a beefy computer to run it optimally The best place to test your performance is in a major city like JFKIm enjoying the simulator and love to just fly around with my friends and do FSEconomy flights here and there It is an enjoyable experience so far and with the team wanting to support the game for a long timeI have hope that many of these issues will be fixedI can now fly over my house at 4 FPSCrashed a

1,As a historical novelist and former high school English teacher with over 7 books in my home devoted to ancient Greek literaturehistory and culture I had to try this gameI’m not a fan of ‘gopher’ games that make you run around collecting itemsrescuing damsels in distressdelivering messagesand murdering politicians to level your character  The whole premises seems rather tedious and unimaginativeand I am not the most nimble finger clickerI was prepared to spend a good portion of my playing time getting my head lopped offyeahthere is a pretty steep learning curve here  I did spend a lot of my initial hours zigging when I should have been zaggingand with my opponent’s spear in my headbut I stuck with it and eventually even an old poop like me was able to figure out the mechanicsSpartaArgosMycenaeDelosAeginaHydraCreteMelos now Santoriniand dozens of other locales on the campaign map multiple times  I’ve walked around the ruins at Delphistrolled the docks of Piraeus and walked through valley of Laconia for research for my books  I wanted to see these places at they might have looked 25 years ago and that for me is the true joy of Assassin’s Creed Odysseyyou’d expect to see historical figures like PericlesSocratesAlcibiades and Archidamas in a game about the Peloponnesian War  But that anyone outside of academia even knows who BrasidasAspasiaHerodotus and Pausanias wereis impressive  Kudos to youErechtheion and Parthenon as they were shiny and newinstead of in piles of rubble  I wanted to gaze up at Phidias statue of Zeus in Olympus one of the wonders of the ancient Greek world that no longer existsspeak to the Pythia at the temple of Delphiand see the five villages of Sparta as they might have looked  Getting to walk the streets of AthensArgos and Elis was like taking a trip back in time  Magicalthe game isn’t perfect  The pronunciation of common names like Pericles and Socrates and the character’s accents were maddening  I can only guess that Ubisoft believes we’ve Americanized the real pronunciationsor at least I hope that’s what they were thinking  Ultimately it’s a minor annoyanceguess you can’t have everythingbut have no connection to the Agiad royal family  By rights they should have been Pausanias’ cousinsbut they’re not  I don’t know who they are The whole Pythagorasismyfather thing is rather bizarre and makes no sense at allas it serves no purpose  Suffice it to say that I enjoyed the gameget drunk and sing songs with Socrates at an Athenian symposiumfeel the Aegean Sea roll beneath your feet on the deck of a  triremeor stare out in wonder at the lights twinkling over Attica at twilighttry this game  You won’t be disappointedAfter my experience with AC OriginsI was reluctant to buy this game It looked almost the same as Origins to meand as somebody who wasnt particularly fond of Originsthat wasnt a good sign NeverthelessI had quite a bit of money left in my Steam wallet so I decided to buy itmade it betterand threw in some of its own stuff as well It feels a lot more fleshed out than any of the previous games in the entire franchisethe game world is beautifully designed I loved Origins game worldbut I have to say that Odysseys game world is a lot better It is a lot more vibrantand it is incredibly easy to get lost in it There are plenty of things to do and plenty of places to exploremaking travel between them not too much of a hassle The map is huge Im 76 hours in and I havent fully discovered it all yet The amount of detail they put into it is nothing short of incrediblealthough not perfectare still better from previous gamesaside from a few overexaggerated animations My main issue in the graphical department is the poor rendering Textures can sometimes fail to load in properly and the draw distance is far from impressiveso for my playthrough I chose Kassandra Either wayyou play as a mercenary in ancient Greece during the Pelponesian Wara time of great struggle between the Athenians and the Spartansand after that I found myself hooked There are three story branches that the game has you follow You acquire these new branches as you progress through the story Im not going to talk about these branches in this review because I honestly think you should discover what they are for yourselves when you play this What they areand the way they are revealedare brilliant The more you go through the gamethe more content is available to you It can get overwhelming sometimesbut the things you say do have consequencesnot really Once you reach the half way point of the gameit begins to fall a bit flat Its not that it becomes badits just not as good The level of mystery begins to become a bit stale and the structure of the main quests begins to be a little repetitive You find yourself having to do other needless things before being able to do the main questwhich can get annoying As well as this the ending to the main story branch is a bit weakand honestly a bit cheesywhich was something that was incredibly forgetable in Origins Its still not that greatbut its more interesting in Odyssey and the conclusion to it is excellentthe story overall is goodand that goes for all three story branches The writing in Odyssey is engaging and I find myself liking the missions and the characterswhich is something that Origins struggled to do for meyou will notice a lot of similarities when it comes to gameplay The combat is very similarand some of the other game mechanics that were in Origins are present in Odyssey as well What makes them different in Odysseyis that theyve been drastically improved The game has fully embraced its RPG side which means it isnt holding back on anythingor exploration mode Guided mode is essentially what Origins was with a compass and icons pointing to where you need to go Exploration mode removes all of this and makes you figure out where you need to go with the tips youve been given from talking to people or finding notes or letters This makes the game a lot more challenging and serves as a way more memorable experience to say the leastthe combat is really entertaining You can fight using a variety of different weapons and the introduction of combat abilities makes these fights a lot more exhilarating You gain a skill point each time you level up which can be used to invest in these abilitiesresulting in the whole thing looking goofy Assassination executions can sometimes screw you over and get you spotted by other enemieswhich can get pretty annoyingbut Odyssey has done it almost perfectly Its simpleand it can be really exciting Your ship can be upgraded using resourcesand the more you upgradethe better your ship can sustain itself During your travelsyou can recruit new people to join your ship These people will give your ship bonuses and will assist you in boarding other shipsyou need to weaken the hold of the controlling faction Once a conquest battle is unlockedyou can begin a massive battle that will decide who controls the region You have the ability to choose which side you want to be withOdyssey introduces bounty hunters If you commit a crime and it has been witnessedyou risk placing a bounty on yourself This will send a bounty hunter after you They are smart and very powerfuland can show up when you least expect itthis was a major issue in Originsand almost made me give up on it Throughout my playthroughI rarely had the need to grindand when I didit was hardly any hassle for me at allas the ways you can level up are plentiful and entertaining The amount of XP you gain increases the more you level upwhich is a brilliant way to tackle grind If you dont rushyou shouldnt have an issueIm really pleased with this game Im glad it didnt end up being an Origins 2 The writing is good and the characters are memorable The game world is stunning and is filled with things to do The only things that drag this game down for me are the poor rendering and the poor midlate story pacing If youre willing to pay the price tagthis is definitely a game you shouldnt missbe sure to give it a like Im still learning Judging whether or not you’ll want to play this game is most easily done by comparing it to its direct predecessorAssassin’s Creed Originswith which Odyssey shares a lot of its DNAand the setting of Ancient Egypt is wonderfulbut urlhttpssteamcommunitycomidgreatjonumberrecommended58216I found there to be severe flaws in the foundation of what that game does regarding stealthcombatand storyurl Typically with an Assassin’s Creed game I expect a great core experience that often lacks polish in terms of stability due to the grueling yearly release schedule from Ubisoft that doesn’t allow adequate QA time to fix such things With Originsit was the opposite—The core experience was lesser than Syndicate’sbut the game was very polished It ran well and looked gorgeousfull of people raving about its wonderful setting and graphics while neglecting the deeper issues the game had at its core Odysseythenreminds me a lot of what Syndicate was to Unity an improvement of the core mechanics and the smoothing out of the previous games rough edgesthen you’ll probably love Odyssey It’s just Origins with added light roleplayingMUCH better combatmore practical skill treesand some key new features to provide enough new territory that it doesn’t simply feel like Origins in a new settingfeel free to read onwhich introduced customizable gearthere have been growing light RPG elements to the Assassin’s Creed seriesincluding the introduction of skill trees in Syndicate Continuing this trendOdyssey has become a fullblown action RPG rather than just an open world game with some RPG elements It’s clear the team was playing a lot of Witcher 3 during development assuperficiallyroleplaying and story are more developed Howevera lot of this comes to naughtbecause most of the side quests are still boringfiller fetch questsand a lot of the decisions you have to make are little more than windowdressing the illusion of choice rather than actual choice I reloaded saves only to realize that the same thing happens in most instances no matter which choice you make While its nice to have the option to select dialogue this time aroundstory and roleplaying still clearly need more work put into them to deliver on the promise of better story and writingand the combat itself was difficult to judge due to the unrealistic speed at which animations played The game felt like it was aping Dark Souls without understanding what makes its combat great Combat in Odysseyhoweverhas several more layers of polish Animations seem more naturaldodging takes place over a judgeable distanceeasy countering is back Adding depth are Adrenal Skillswhich basically act the way the single Overpower skill did in Origins There are a number of different Adrenaline skills to unlock within the skill treewith each providing a different facet than the otherwhich had few useful skills and a lot of what felt like unexciting padding that didn’t change gameplay greatly Many of the abilities that were locked to gear in Origins have been instead relocated to the skill tree different bow styles from Origins are now tied to skill unlockswhich gives you far greater freedom in customizing the way your character looks via gear It’s a very good decision as the skill tree from Origins felt like something that was tackedon because somebody on the team decided “we should have skill trees in this game” The skill tree in Odyssey feels more natural and has a huge impact on gameplaythoughis a fantastic port of what was obviously inspired by Shadow of Mordor’s Nemesis system Odyssey takes place during the Peloponnesian War in 431 BCand this war has a number of the different city states of Greece going at oneanother chiefly Athens and Sparta Odyssey’s modified version of the Nemesis system depicts what feels like a livingbreathing war going on around you Athens and Sparta change territory through the story and your actionswith each city’s forces being easily identifiableand each occupying different fortresses as they move They have leaderscities you can disruptmoney and materiel you can steal and destroy There are various war leaders and mercenaries that function as the actual Nemeses from the Shadow gamesand somehow the team has made this system feel more natural in an Assassin’s Creed game than the Lord of the Rings games which inspired it It’s the main draw of Odysseyand it’s a huge one It all works smoothlyindicative of significant polishand the game is worth playing just to experience it even if you were burnt out on Originsand it’s a fantastic qualityoflife addition There are also now nonlethal takedowns and enemy recruitingdeepening stealth gameplayand Origins taking that away really damaged the experience for me They are now back as a map featureallowing you to hover over map markers for a brief paragraph of backgroundthough The balance of the game is offrequiring a bit too much grinding if you’re not clearing every map marker like I am The leveling system is also far too rigidturning enemies one level higher than you into health sponges This should be addressed in a future balance patch It didn’t affect me much because I’m always overleveledbut I could see how someone focused only on the main story would become frustratedwhich is puzzling in a game about Greek combat—A style of combat based almost wholly on the use of a heavy bronze shield I loved the shields in Origins and am puzzled and disappointed to see them gomuch of Odyssey looks the same as Origins The menus are nearly identical You have a pet bird to scout with The running and climbing animations are the same The buildings look similar The graphics are of the same quality But these similaritieslike the critical praise for Originsare only surfacedeepand it’s become one of my favorites in the seriesIm not saying its as good as the Witcher 3bI bought the Gold Editionwhich seems to have a better valuethe Hourglass mountand the spear Harvester of Time  this pack gives more warrior damage boostand the Dusk Blood Offering sword  this pack is more stealth focusedTHE FATE OF ATLANTIS and bonus mission The Secrets of Greece  The Games Assassins Creed III REMASTERED and Assassins Creed Liberation REMASTEREDthe only difference between Gold and Ultimate Edition is that Ultimate has the Deluxe Edition Content Unless you want to spend extra money to receive the deluxe pack for temporary xp boost and some armor and skins the armour looks really cool and is useful after level 5 and not really useful after level 8  upgrading it at the blacksmith takes too much resources and there is much better armor later on up to you to buy Ultimate vs Gold Edition  price difference is not as big when on salethough I bought Gold Edition then Id suggest you to get the Gold Editionibmeaning if you buy the base game or the Gold Edition and decide you want the Deluxe Edition later  you will be rebuying the game again with the DeluxeUltimate Editionand thats money wasted Buying the base game with the intention to buy Season Pass or any of the other editions later onis not worth it at all either  buy Ultimate Edition to have absolutely everything or buy the Gold Edition to have everything important gameplaywise You are saving money and getting the best of the gameand available only through Assassins Creed III Remastered Soin order to play Liberation Remasteredyou need to launch Assassins Creed III Remastered Both Remasters are slightly better graphicallythan their previous versionsbefore trying to launch the remastered content because Ubisoft Connect needs to load the

Last Patch 151  All DLCSI would like to share my final opinion No Spoilerlong and decent main story which takes about 35 hoursbetter tell your friends and family that you dont have that much time for them and ask for some vacationa lot of fishesmanta rays and whalesblack flag and rogue is backan eagle to discoverautomatic walkingdiscovery tourstory creator mode and so onbut some textures dont look well Trees and grass at a far distance looking garbage Some animations looking weird and heartless I think that Ive enjoyed the origins graphics more  especially the sync point viewsespecially considered to everything after AC IIIbut sadly not as good as the desmond story which I really enjoyedbut it does not affect the story or any stats like a male is strongerbut not as agile as a femalethe GTA wanted system and the shadow of war nemesis system Its a nice ideabut I often felt interrupted at discoveringbut it doesnt really matterbut its mostly the same thing gameplaywise Kill this personsteal somethingtalk to a person and so onbut only after level 5but without new skills or something like that Lazy and latebut sadly the game isnt that great optimized Most settings barely boost your fps Im getting a stable 6 fps at almost max settings Ive tested it on different CPUs and my GTX 17 This is definitely not that great especially considered that it does need 12 more performance than originsalthough it doesnt look better Everything else was fine for me I didnt have any serious bugsit didnt crash or freeze The loading times on an SSD are finebut you still have to be at least 3 levels under your enemieswhich does make it pretty pointlessyou have to do a lot of side quests to level up It does throw you out of the storywhich is really badbut of courseits definitely nothing which belongs in a full price gamebut its way too much You have to upgrade your gear like every 12minbut still expensiveI do like every AC game I do think that every part does have something special and their up and downs Its also my favorite game franchise Thats also a big reason why I wanted to wait until Ive finished the whole game before I do share my opinion I had a lot of fun with this gamebut much more to donew and improved thingsexcept things as graphics and performance Its the better game gameplaywisebut not storywiseno assassinsand no templars So No How could it even be Its before the brotherhood has been created BUT why yes Wellsadly its still an Assassins Creed even if it is not the same feeling as for an example in the Ezio Trilogycause of the isuthe antic artifacts and present storyI would only buy it on sale now Ive bought the Gold Edition to play before release Buy the season passgold edition if you cant get enough The season pass includes the 2 DLCs and AC III and Liberation remasteredbut with 3h per episode to complete everything way too short If I am honest and hard its like almost every DLC these days it just feels like free content for money Soyou can skip it if you had enough of odysseyIve heard that each episode takes about 112hbut I cant confirm that It does add a new area and took me about 18 hours to complete everything It has been great More mythological stuffbut thats what I honestly expected for the main gameadded automatic arrow craftinga story creator modethe discovery tourweekly eventswhich are repetitiveeasy and nothing special at alla visual customization systema mastery systemand many other thingswhich expand the game for free The performancebalancing and other negative points are sadly the sameI really do like the game Its a good gamebut the worst Assassins Creed For meit was the GOTY 218 for PCbut sadly you cant write more in the reviewThis game made me book a holiday to Greece and visit the ancient sites roughly 8 hours for the full storyie people of your level are a challenge in groupbe under leveled and youll get you ass handed to yoube over leveled and youll be doing the ass kicking although the game does scale up as you level upup closeor assassination or even in combination with each otherkill someone and move up in ranks although if you are being hunter it does get ridiculous sometimes if you have 4 mercenaries hunting your ass at the same time spoileryoure better off paying off your bounty at that pointspoilerwho doesnt love a good ass handing with a spoilerminotaurspoiler or spoilercyclopsspoilerI love these kind of games open world  rpg that have a lot of diversion and things to work ondoesnt get repetitive or boringyou can always switch to doing something elseIll keep it short and sweetor wholl want to do the same to youall kinds of them with all kinds of things and stuff in themin which your lieutenants are chosen by your hand in battle and now fight for your glorymake them rulers of parts of the world and gain mighty gear and weaponsmuch more in factthat epic story is for you to find outI never thought Id think much of it WellOdyssey has straightened me outjust let your true spirit free and dive into ancient Greece and intoI tamed a wolf Named him and had great adventures with him That all ended when some Spartan soldier killed himh1Prosh1exploration etcbut daggers are clearly the bestOdysseys greatest strength is also its greatest weakness bBloatb Far too many points of interest in the game are simply duplicatedand thus pointless to visit Same campsfilled with the same enemieswith the same layoutsand same chests While I visited every point of interest in OriginsI have to say I simply didnt bother with many of the locations in Odyssey I wouldnt recommend visiting them eitherunless mindless repetition is right up your alleyhas to be the annoying RPG system I played the game on Hard with enemy level scaling Because of thatgear has to be constantly upgraded in order to be relevantand upgrades cost a LARGE amount of money and resources which require grinding Raising the level cap to 99 was also a massive mistake on Ubisofts part as wellbecause leveling basically made the game harder I only really had full end game gear after close to 1 hours of gameplaystats are extremely important Not having 1 crit chance from your equipment basically takes away guaranteed assassination killswhich is an insult to a game in the ASSASSINs Creed franchise I cant say I enjoyed the direction Ubisoft chose here Perhaps it would be best to simply call this game Greek Mercenary Odysseyand Origins is easily my favourite installment Origins had just the right amount of content the points of interest actually served a pointand the obscure locations gave you cool equipment I also found Egypt to have the better looking landscape as compared to Greece It also didnt have the obnoxious RPG stat system either But perhaps Im biasedseeing as the game that preceded Origins happens to be the worst installment in the franchiseif you couldnt afford to play bothId still recommend Odyssey solely based on bang for buck You simply cannot go wrong with the sheer amount of content provided in this installmentdespite it being the greatest departure from the franchise b91byou can sparta kick people off of cliffsBUY IT IF 1 you like RPGs and want a vibrant world to dive in2 are an AC fan for your collectionThank god that damn shield from Origins is gone  Palthough some people did love the shield based combat i know Free running is also pretty darn easy nowKassandraAlexios can pretty much climb any damn object no matter how jaggedsmooth it is The quests sometime get pretty boring and repetitive Go someplacekill some thugsrescue XXX from bandits and as you level upkilling bad guys becomes more and more routine and easy thanks to unlocked abilities The Naval Combat system feels refreshed and its fun to ram ships around and roam freely Overallgood improvements herei found the storyline to be a bit dull when compared to Originseven though the protagonists are well designed and animatedthey sometimes feel hollow Maybe due to not such a great story There are some fun moments and interesting characters though Even if youre running it at mediumhigh settingsOdyssey is a treat to watch and the option to switch to travel speed when travelling via ship showcases the amazing lighting and water quality of the ocean from a spectacular anglethe character quality and facial animations have certainly improved Overall a treat to watch and experience ancient Greece in a beautiful way If you can run it at ultraeven betteryoull be somewhat disappointed as there are not much Assassins Creedstaple features in the game Instead of earlier AC gamess emphasis on sneaking inyou can always barge insword and spear blazing but ultimately its upto you what approach you takequite a few amazing creaturesmonsters to battle with as you level up and on the other hand several menial tasks likefetching wine and helmets as well A good balance you think if you cant decideread the starting para of this review againit may help P77 hours inI have reached level 42 and Im not close to finishing the main storynot even half way Too busy completing side quests and everything else in this huge and incredibly beautiful game Every time I decide to go for a main quest something else comes in the way And to be honestI do procrastinate the main story because I dont want Kassandras story to end Im pretty confident to say that Assassins Creed Odyssey is the best game in the series followed by Assassins Creed Origins and Assassins Creed 2the storythe music and soundthe combatthe skillsthe RPG elementsthe world and how stunning and different every area is Just as in Originsthe world feels so aliveif not a tiny bit more in this one Take the time to listen to conversations around you and watch what people are doingit can be pretty funny at timesAssassins Creed Odyssey is a masterpieceYes sure its not following the other AC series and its not actually a Assassins creed but its a wonderful game Heres whyI liked it enough to play it for 54 hoursso yeah it rocks
1,h1Fallout New Vegash1and since then Ive played nearly 1500 hours of it across 12 playthroughs of 120 hours each It is my favorite game of all timebut not necessarily because of nostalgia Fallout New Vegas hasto my mindnever been surpassed in its pairing of roleplaying iandi narrative flexibilityby any game since its release  and Ive played The Witcher 3so you know this game must have something special Thereforethats what this review imusti provemost of everything you ineedi to know about the plot of New Vegas is laid out for you in one of Fallouts many iconic slideshowsbut if you are entirely new to the franchiseId suggest clicking urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnvqmpPDaQhereurl OtherwiseIll just state that New Vegas is much more connected to the stories of Fallouts 1  2 than 3 or due to it being set on the West Coastand is in some ways a continuation of the story from Fallout 2 The restId rather not spoil Althoughin this specific Fallout You are a courierhired by the Mojave Expressto deliver a package to the New Vegas Strip What seemed like a simple delivery job has taken a turn for the worsethe character you create can essentially be ianyone you want them to bei If you have the ability to coherently write a characterFNV becomes your own narrative playground one of my favorite elements of the game The character creation tools presented at the start of the game are suitably expansive as well between skillstagsand traits Further progression in New Vegas is also superbas you raise your skills accordingly and select from many gamealteringor at least usefulperks The character creation and progression in FNV is exemplarychoicesconsequencesand other roleplaying mechanics to be found These systems all work together in perfect harmonywhich puts real weight behind your actions This could even mean small actionssuch as how you talk to a companion changing their character arc Speaking of talkingthe dialogue system is especially of noteas this is where most decisions are madeand where you express the personality of your character There are always a stunning amount of choices you can makeand youll never feel like a viable option was left out  in any situation Many of your decisions even leave lasting effects on the Mojavewhich Ill explain in greater detail later onas you can choose from one of four main factions to end the game withas well as affect nearly two dozen other minor factions  either by aiding or hindering them Each organization has their own backstory and loreand all of them have quest lines worth delving into These groups will remember how you treat themwhich builds a lasting relationship between them and the player Its these dynamic factions that really bring the world to life through their thematic depthand give the Mojave a livedin feelId like to highlight why its my favorite game Because of how incredibly detailed and loredense the Fallout series isthe jawdropping amount of narrative flexibility in New Vegas is what seals the deal for me The ability to shape the Mojave as I see fita world that is so well realizedis unbelievably tantalizing to me and I dont think any RPG has handled this better It makes me feel like such a tour de forcethat its my character making these monumental decisionsand changing the future of a whole region  foreverclearlyand the desolate design of this setting establishes a highly authentic apocalyptic atmosphere I find the vanilla graphics to be timeless because of thisbut mods can certainly modernize them The region is a joy to explore tooas there are countless locations with pieces of environmental storytellingquestsand loot within them Theres also an optional hardcore modewhich makes these barren wastes just that much harder to surviveIll quickly state that almost every sidequest in New Vegas is spectacular They were crafted with the utmost attention to detailas they all have several ways to progress through them and sincerely thoughtful writing applied to them Each storyline has a distinct and often original motifwhich makes them all a pleasure to play and experiencewho all share one thing in common purpose Every follower has their own questsbackstoriesand motivating factors that make them relatable to the playerand from even the most minor of named characters to the most importanteveryone has identifiable personality traits No one feels like wasted potential These honest personas are what grounds your adventures in FNVby making you truly care about the Mojave and its inhabitantsFallout New Vegas combat is funbut also clunky Shootingstabbingbludgeoningdisintegratingand exploding your adversaries is what youll spend most of your time doing when not exploring the wastes or having a pleasant chatand this level of variety is where the strength of the combat lies Just because its clunkydoesnt mean there isnt visceral joy to be had The VATS system has also returnedbut I dont personally use it In essence the combat is just good enough to impressbut moddingwhich Ill mention latercan improve in considerablyundeniablyits performance This is almost entirely the engines fault Bethesda have never been known for their technical aptitude in games creation  and Obsidian had to make do Minor bugs run rampantas well as crashes if you dont make necessary tweaks to the ini fileswhich you can look up to discover what Im talking about The game also stutters oftenbut mods can alleviate this issue for the most part My advice would be to save oftenand install a few modswhich is the next topicand the postFallout 3 series in generalis its customizability Anything from simple fixes to new questsand visual overhauls to gameplay tweaks can be added to the gameand to do this Id recommend the urlhttpwwwnexusmodscomnewvegasFNV Nexusurl Id suggest watching some tutorials on how to mod the gameand from there NVSENVSRNVACand Project Nevada are all essential mods as far as Im concernedbut its up to you Visual mods are also welcomehowever theyre subjective so I wont recommend any here All considered imoddingi a useful skill for any FNV playerbut what it does do correctly is simply exactly what I want from a game The roleplayingdecision makingcharactersworldlorenarrative  and so much morejust binds together into such a cohesive package of everything I ask for from an open world RPGthat I cant resist its call Andif I remember correctly but of course I doI could never forgetit sounds a little like thisJingleurliPatrolling the Mojave makes you wish for a New Vegas Remasterh1Fallout New

seethings to shootbut four waysthe navmesh in this game worksbut is a little sloppy Sometimes NPCs will walk into walls and furniture But it is easliy overlooked when you get further into the game You may even find it funnybut can effect your overall experience of it IE glitchingFPS dropsand crashesbut with all of the DLC will it Yes it cost an extra 1000 but is worth it compared to buying the standard edition for 999 and all the DLC for 229but does have a fantastic modding community I would purchase the Ultimate Edition instead of the Standardjust my opinion Steam does have The GECK in the tools section which will allow you to make mods for the game✧ Easy Steps on How to Play Fallout New Vegas ✧id rather play fallout new vegas than support my kidsThe Wild West meets the Fallout Post Apocalyptic world and a great game is bornbut many different factions are presenteach with their own unique and often hilarious style And of course there is a power stuggle between a prewar industrialistCaesers legion and the New California Republic is under way and you are about to be thrown into the middle of it What will you dohilarious dialogue and so many entertaining quests that it would be hard to do them all in a single play through The DLC adds many more hours of fun although it is quite varied in flavour and in valuebut all of them are worth playing at least once The exception might be Lonesome Roadwhich most people loved but I had some issues withespecially with one decision it forces you to take that I felt was not one any of my characters would ever have made But Old World Blues may be my favourite DLC for any game ever The first fifteen minutes had me crying with laughterthis game could provide several hundred hours of play time and still have things to

models look decent and animate a little awkwardlywhile the open world is often littered with a lot of tinycluttered textures although it gets a pass from me since its pretty believable that a postapocalyptic world isnt squeaky clean of dirt and grime The lighting is okay but some indoor areas are pretty dark so be sure to use your pipboy light oftenyou wake up and discover that you have been rescued and nursed back to full health From therethe main story has you follow up on your mystery assassin in order to figure out what he stole from you and why he wants itthere is a larger plot unfolding as political tension is rising in the major factions residing in the Mojave wasteland There is an escalating conflict about land dispute as the NCR are expanding eastwards into Nevada attempting to establish order and law to the lawless desert while the Legion are expanding westwards trying to take over territory while committing acts of mass murder and enslaving any survivors they encounter There are a multitude of other factions that are interconnected in this political war such as the Great Khansa tribe of warriors that has repeatedly been weakened and pushed out of their homes by the NCRand the Brotherhood of Steela group of people obsessed with controlling technology that are in hiding due to a previously fight with the NCR where they were outnumbered and also pushed out of their residencewho is rumored to be in control of the New Vegas strip which is home to a wealthy and profitable gambling scene but nobody has ever seen him and he is somehow in control of a large army of robots that do his bidding Although the story begins with you having a multitude of questionsas you continue to play you understand how all of these factions interactwhy they like or dislike each otherand what kind of middle grounds they are willing to meet onif anyin order to solve this dilemmayou get a much better idea of their relationships and attitudes towards others and more notablythe factions of the Mojave Particularlythe companionVeronicahas like 50 lines of dialogue about who she iswhat her goal isher relationship to her faction familyhow she feels about her enemy factionsand how she even feels about youand the game will account for it accordingly If you meet up with an NPC that is part of a quest chain that you are followingbut you decide to kill himherthere is more often than not an alternate way to proceed in the questor the game will account for that death in a later questline and see that you killed the NPC and proceed with the quest under that circumstance Perhaps most importantlyyou have the complete freedom to play as a villain in a Fallout game If you want toyou can be a complete knob to everybodykill everyone you dislikeand align yourself with villainous factions to aid them in their political agenda Your relationship will deteriorate with anyone that dislikes your actionsbut you have that choice to pursue if you so desirethe tunes immerse you in the feeling that you are actually a nomadic wanderer travelling the desert with a gun at your side unless Johnny Guitar is being playedstandard firearmsexplosivesand tech weapons that use laser and plasma technologysome of them being unmarked and up to you to discover off the beaten path Exploration is to your benefitbut the game feels like it doesnt agree and your shot proceeds to miss entirely Some weaponsnamely the bigger ones like a missle laucherdont really have a proper aimironsighted assist to make your shots line up more accuratelythe game suffers from a small voice cast You will probably hear many NPCs recycle the same voice actor throughout the game The voices are greatalbeit a little too frequently used among the different NPCs so to speak I swear to youYuri Lowenthal voices all but a single man in the Brotherhood of Steel bunkermoreso if you are afraid of LARGE insectssome sections of the game will likely give you either a moment of terror

1,How to correctly play this gameuse a magazine or a book to replace your mousepadRuined my lifeActually the best game in this world It still doesnt matter if u have NASA PC or you are playing on MicroWavefun servers and even moreThis game saved my virginitySo heres a little storyand before I was even bornmy mom would work late nights at the the hosipital she was a nurseleaving my dad home alone He wouldnt really have anything to do so one dayhe went to the store and bought CounterStrike it was back then when you needed a disc to play steam wasnt around yet and he would play until she got home 14 years later on SaturdayApril 15th 2017he personally bought me and my little brother copies of CounterStrike so we can all play togetherbest game evercant buy skinscaseskeysstickers  gaben cant steal our moneyThis game is older than half of the steam community userslove ith1bihard to masterAfter playing it for 20 yearsI think the game is alrightNo r8 revolver1010 will play againh1 Once a fire lit in my heart and now it will burn there forever h1since this is a part of my youth and the first steps in esportswhen I was still 1112 years old the sky was bluerand the grass was greenerand the Orcs were no match for the present  although what am I talking about  it is from another…or even an ordinary knife000000 eyes are looking at you onlineand you need to defuse this bomb or detonate itand then everything depends on your Teamthen make a minus from the Elephant and here it is But do not forget to discard 2 Flashes on the Zigzag and make 2 more minuses from your Desert Eagleand now you are left alone And time goes by…but youas alwayswill love this game and smile after 10 100 years when you see it seeing how new gamers play something newersmile with a grin behind their back and burn the same fire of Love for this world of video games for the rest of their livesthe World has changed 10 times But this game remained the same as it was in 19992000and what it was like to live in the World of esports at the turn of 1000 years Then you need to play this game for 1000 hours so that your eyes and hands and brain are immersed in this World and stay here forever with Love in your heartthere is a lot of something beyond new and amazing aroundbut why all thisand you see your favorite Team of friends on the monitorso your girlfriend will be under the table  bEvery server is spanish or french16 is love 16 is life our childhood ❤CounterStrike Okafter 9 years of unlimited fun with friendsI have finally quit counter strike Counter strikein all of its versionsits just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy it Its a great game and allyou just cant stop playing ityou can just sit and play with your friends for days with out stoping The huge weaoponary option you can choose and the smooth and sound of the gameits just fcking addicting With this games Ive met so many different people and unique friends This game is literally GOLD To all the young players who are looking for a good cheep and fun game to play with their friendsI highlly recommend on this Ive got with steam record 2484hrs record in counter strike IN TOTTALand who knows how many more hrs in a non official steam version of this game Great Game GG WPall I can sayas alwaysGL  HF • Do you like original gamesCS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history It isin my opinionthe bestso for the girly girlsit is an activity to indulge inas well as a boom boxto spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game I wanted to play every chance that i could On my road of cs adventuresI encountered a couple of problems those being that nobody was as fervent as I was about playingand that when we did playnobody was good enoughso it wasnt a lot of funand signed upbut with skepticism at how the class was going to be Sure enoughI was proven wrong We started off by practicing a little bit Then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class I made some friendsand played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the coursethe whole world disappears Only Ithe mouseand my teammates remain We are united in a common goal We strive collectively towards an end we all desire Each player has a spot to hold They stand ready and waitingeager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory ThusCS celebrates the unity of manthe indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence When I play CSI play until my veins pump battery acidand then I play some morethere is a role for us to playand we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that roleand thereby our destiny What destiny might you ask I spoke before of unity And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family That is the nature of counterstrike the many working as one One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheelsmoving in unisonhappy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves Not that these small metal objects are actually animateIm of course speaking only metaphoricallyI have increased in skillbut I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share Even if that team is less than ideal I have realized that cs is about more than just ones athletic ability Insteadthere is a deeper meaning behind the coltthe AKthe AWPthe deaglethe sands under my feet in d2 or inferno And more importantlythe teammates at my side I love them It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatnessI love cs I love to win I love pushing myself to my physical limits Its that feeling that first drove me to the computer For every second that I am not playing csthere is only an unquenchable thirst to play A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outsidesitting at the televisionor playing sports I had an extraordinary time playing this gameand I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel This review may be overthis game may be deadbut I will never stop playing counerstrike 16I met a lot of people who slept with my mother 1010old but gold yesI was on the fence about this gamebut now I think I can recommend it
1,It took a year and a half of updatesbut damn its good now  I have to change my reviewthe game is actually about building and exploration now instead of pond hut simulator  Theres actually a good variety of locations now and things to do  Took forever to get the lore right too  It used to be full of just useless notes youd already read being dropped in the dumbest of ways  Now its actually got some story to it  I wouldnt say FUNCOM made the perfect gamebut this is probably their best work now  Its no longer an empty game of click and gather  Its got a real building system and the skills arent broken anymore  I dont change my reviewsbut this right here gets a thumbs up finallyI like Conan ExilesI play all the survival gamesRust7 Days to DieARKI think I like Conan best  No modern weaponscant get head shot by some wild kid with a killer instinctno real bombscant get your doors blown off by some wild player with destruction on their minds  Im 64 years old and Ive been a gamer since the early 80s  Work at a prison sorrystate correctional institution so Conan is my wind down from a hecticsometimes exasperating dayTo the Devsdont fuck it up000 playersdont drive people away shitty updatesor useless featurespolish it upsquash the bugsand get it the fuck out of early accessSo me and 2 friends are playing this on a private dedicated PvE server None of us played Ark and the likesbut we are all long time RPG fans Conan Exiles went under our radar for a while as it mostly gets grouped as an Arklike Truth isto usits pretty much the multiplayer survival Skyrim we always dreamed ofdo yourself a favor and play this with your buddies This is not just a sandbox theres much more to itand Im not a PvP kinda guy But yeah me and my buds are having a blast so farreally Unfortunatelythe Siptah expansion came out during our playthrough and introduced tons of bugs and adjustments that kinda ruined the end of our journey We had many bosses bug out on usand some gameplay changes were not just hard to get used to but also downright questionable Its been a few months but it seems all recent updates still concentrate on Siptah which we havent played I personally think splitting the map was a bad decisionas the original map is beautifully scuplted in a coherent way and tells a story that cries for expansions Stillall in allif you have buddies to play it withI still recomend itiIll get this out of the way before I even start I am going to compare this game to ARK and Rust While it is its own beast with its own merits and flawsit is within the same genreand many people will wonder how it compares in certain aspectsiConan Exiles has the most potential Ive ever seenand its the first day I am completely baffled by the negative response Compared to ARK at its releasethis game has a much clearer vision and a more complete framework even if a lot of the contents of that framework are missing or buggy Im inclined to believe the negative reception is due to the fact that Conan is an existing IPnot a new one People might just expect an IP like this to be completeand not release in Early Access Im not entirely sure why those people purchased the game in the first place There is definitely a bright blue EARLY ACCESS banner on the Steam store pagethe game does have a lot of issues Theres a lot of seemingly random framedropseven to the point of the game completely freezing for several seconds Im confident this will be worked out with further optimisationbut it is an issue that has somewhat affected my enjoyment of the gameat least initially is superb I can only suspect that it will get better from hereibut not ARK simple I said simplenot uglyibut its obvious there was a lot of care put into the visualsibut its pretty niceibut a bit more streamlined in my opinion As you level up you gain points to level up attributes like Strength or Encumbrance Furthermore you gain points to purchase crafting recipes But unlike in ARKa lot of the recipes in Exiles will net you two or more itemsilistBut Definite Room For Improvementucombat becomes much much better There is a degree of Git gud going on Howeverblocking responsiveness isnt fantasticand enemy range isnt always what youd expect it to beibut also better The size of the individual building pieces is rather smallbut despite thisyou dont feel like a giant standing in a hobbit hole if you only build your shelter one wall high Looking at you hereARKilistbut not so much that its unplayableibut it is still much better than similar games at their launchibut CoOpeven with a good connection has lots of desync issues Time of day isnt always going to match up between players I was also—as the person not hosting—randomly losing my tools as I tried to equip them At one point we also saw two different items in the same slot of a chest Removing the item and dropping it reverted it to normalibut its also somewhat problematic for players too Animals will frequently spawn right on top of you Out of the time Ive spent playingno less than 3 crocodilealligators made my ballsack their personal spawnpoint Of courseI could have been in the wrong place at the wrong timebut it seemed a bit too coincidental This exacerbates the issue with low level beds When youre low enough level that you are having trouble with a single crochaving another spawn on you means nearly certain death I havent unlocked beds yetbut Im assuming theyre more than single useas the low level bedrolls break after one respawn I feel like this is kind of counter productive All it does is encourage resource wasting by building 2 bedrolls and filling your base with them A much betterbut still similar mechanic would be to damage the bedroll after each respawnand require it to be repaired They could also implement a respawn cooldown That would be vastly superior to how they currently workilistand are willing to provide feedbackthere are definitely worse things you could spend 30 on If youre wondering if the game has promise and are just looking to see if it might be worth buying in the future unless the devs royally eff it upthis game is bveryb promisingIve liked this game from the start I started playing during the first month of Early Access The mood and atmosphere really suited meeven though I have little to none experience with the conan universe Also I generally like open world survival games I came to Conan from countless hours of Ark Survival Evolvedand although they have many similaritiesthis is an entirely different gameand much of the game mechanics has been revamped several timessuch as combat There has also been some trouble with the developers interraction with the communitybut this have improved a lotit didnt have that much to offer to the survival genre that we hadnt already seen in similar gamesexcept maybe the avatarslarge deitybased creatures that can be summonned at endgame to really wreck havoc on other players Sadlythis was very overpoweredand the game got boring really quick The gameplay for me at least was mostly Farming  Building  Get raided  Repeat But as I saidthe mood and atmosphere in this game made it bearable none the less And sometimes I would just exploreand each time I would find something newlike a new NPC campfriendly NPCs that would teach you stuffsome kind of lore that is scattered around the entire mapcavesdungeonsetcit was mostly just spamming the attackbutton on buggy creatures while running aroundor shoot the more powerful creatures from a safe place But this was not a big problem for meI enjoyed the game anyways My biggest issue at that time was how easy it was to exploit the game and the mechanicsand the PvP was very unsatisfying It was more or less required to build your base up high on mountains and suchthen remove all the stairs so you couldnt get raided The whole ordeal was just stupid and sadand the game couldnt be played the way it was meant to bebut I reached max lvl and felt like i had seen the most of what the game had to offermany months laterI am backexcept for a more cinematic introand a bit improved Character Creation But it didnt take long before this felt almost like a new game for meand they all have their own patterns which is similar to games like Dark Souls Combat now includes things like lockon and enemy health barwhich is very satisfying for me I havent tried archery yetwhich was my primary fighting method when I first played this gamebut I hope I will see improvements there as wellwith two new biomes Also old familiar places have been pimped upand the world seems even more lively now And stillthe game is more performancefriendly then eversuch as traps for raid protectioncounter measures for the avatarstime window for Structure Damageetc The combat is also more dynamic now you can defeat a player even when you have weaker weapons and lower lvlif you know what youre doing This opens up for building more freelywhich is a very important aspect for me Also I feel the community recently has become more friendly even in Europehahawhich Ive always liked in Conan compared to games like Ark This have also been greatly modifiedimproved There are so many things you can craftand for the architects out therethere is few limitations when it comes to structures and building Alsothe new system of which you learn the different crafts is so satisfying for me at leasteven though it took some time to get used towhen youre not building or engaging in PvPthe gameplay revolves heavily around lore and dungeons this is maybe an even more important aspect in PvE And there is just so much to exploreand I cant wait for the releaseand i was SO looking forward to that A caveat I play on a private server very casually Just a small group of friendsno pvpjust super casual gatheringbuildingetc But with that saidthe highest praise I can give this game is that my wife loves it and finding a game we can play together makes me happyThis is a pretty good open world sandbox not going to lieIve played this mostly on private servers with friends Almost exlusively Played a lot of Rust and stuff like that andya knowyou get tired of hours of work being destroyed for the lolz by a group of aholes slightly more numerous than you You could join themand troll othersand wreck their stuff but it gets old But thats how PvP in these gamse go As a groupsolo experienceits fun to bonk people on the head and drag them back to process them into happy citizens of your towna looooong time agoyou couldnt jump in FPS games Golden Eye Perfect Dark Couldnt jump Go back and play them Its weirdor a small rock and youre likestuckand youre likeBruh reallymate Die doing it But you died doing what you loved And most of allYou Died FREEh1 Corporate

By people buying the game and then profiting of our dataI have only played 4 hours here on steam But that does not mean thatI dont know anything about this game or that I have not played more of it I have played it but not on steam for a good 100 or so hoursFirst offthis is an amazing game Maybe the best hardcore pvp survival game out there Sure its a buggy mess at timesbut the lore is suprisingly cool and pvp barrier of entry is much better than Ark  The building is better than Arkthe items and weapons in the game are better than ark there are a ton of weaponsthe bosses and dungeons are numerous and better much than Ark its a lot of fun and massively underappreciatedRUIN SYSTEM is what hes known as currently He looted our vault thats 100 ft up in the air just by looking at it It wasnt even during raid hours He ran like the speed of a horse and killed me on my mount He was clipping through walls and was killing us even though hes level 20 and were three level 60s and pretty well gearedwe witnessed him raid another vault without breaking it as well and put on the best gear in the game and proceeded to run around killing people When called him out because he was terrible at pvp honestly he crashed the server for over an hour and duped his stats so he had maxed out everythingwhich is something they dobut this is a massive issue in this game and all of the veteran players are leaving Its not like Call of Duty where you just get more killsthe items in this game can sometimes take hundreds of hours to accumulate to the degree that people doand someone just comes in and takes itundermeshes a base where noone can raid itand Funcom doesnt seem to be doing all that much about itor crack down hard on hackers This game will die if they do notI dont like survival games Something about them just never really grabbed me or clicked with meI am losing sleep Should probably throw out a warning out there peoplethat this is addictive once you get into itlike I saidits a survival gameI missed that What matters is how the game is nowpurges raidsand Legendary Creatures that well better come prepared with some friends I thought it would get in the way of the funbut it adds so much I am glad it is thereto meads and ale to get you drunk and add buffs or to warm you up for cold conditions so you dont dieto cookingto alchemical bases for making potions or stronger steelto weaponsarmouretc It feels endless at times with the amount of options you have Very satisfying each time to progress to the next recepe and to unlock new things either through learning or exploration You can even have thralls boink enemies over the head and bend their will to do you bidding and pets nowintuitive and so much fun You can build almost anywhere and almost anything Not gonna say more about this oneother than its a timesiphon that I am enjoying so muchcrafting and building Not to worrysavanahsjunglewoodland and kinda deadish woodlandhighlandancient citiesthe iced north and a bloody volcano Better come prepaired again for different weather conditions Orjust wander to come across other player made settlementsetcdiscover recipesand ofc newmore creatures and enemies It is so full of things to come across it surprised me Making survival at that point take a back seat With cavesdungeonsand morethere is an entire backstory that you have to figure out and discover It might be annoying to some that you need tokind ofin a way discover the story of the game I personally found this to be great and one of the best ways to make my experience completely free I do what I wantand as I do itlittle gems are dropped on my lap Not going into spoiler territorybut I found it to be very goodfor suresometimes it feels a little unfinished And it could do with an ACTUAL cutscene for the ending too Those that finished the game know what I meantrying to free yourself from the lands Or stay there and conquer Warningleaving the lands is permanent And the character is deleted and now freed from the exile lands Serves as a great way to put an end to the madness of no sleep as well I guessalong with how you build your characterhas translated into more role playing elements than a number of role playing games out thereI even played Age of Conan for 2 years subbed when it came out even though I could see so many shortcomings with it and I was against subscriptions even as I caved to it This hereis a great rendition of Hyborian lore that any fan should be rather happy to enjoy and I think now it is in tip top condition From dual wielding daggersto shield and swordto javelinsspearsaxesmaceshammersgreat swordsand even the new addition of the Katana Which I thought would be a gimmick alternate to the greatswords Ooooh no they arentmaceshammers and spears asideI really cant make up my mind which I like more All on a system based on different effects with shield bashingcrippling and bleedingpoisoningdodgingblockingor even kicking enemies to throw them out of guard mode Never had so much fun with real time combat in a game of this type beforethrowing axesfire orbs what have youand ofc bows and arrowsI am glad This is the land of Hyboria Who ever thought of a bunch of wizards running the hills hurling bolts of lightning There is a chance they will add magicbut I kinda hope they dont We can summon huge avatars in the image of gods of worship to rek shop as well Its enough imosingle purchaseand its yours The content you can buy is just cosmetic really With completely new building skinsplus armour and weapon skins that dont power creep into the game and ruin balance And with this system at hand there is potential for them to add so many more variations in the futurePvPPvE with PvP windows on certain hoursdaysfull PvEor go offline and play it solo or coop with friends on private games were mind youall options are yours to controlalong with even admin privelleges just press make admin and youre done for a lot of wacky ways to testbreakor simply enjoy the gamesurvivalbuildingcombatexploration or roleplayingand you are gold to go with plenty hours to wasteits not the best stability I havent tried PvP for this very reasonand do not intend to I dont think I can enjoy a game with frequent 100 ping climbs This is rather noticeable on a real time combat game like this where timing really is key between living or dying And being able to play offline rubbs it in your face when you see how fluid and awesome the game can bealthough less than a third of the time its going bannanasits still a little too much I think and throws your confidence off for things like PvP There are private servers too ofcourseso this experience can varybut nothing too game breaking so far Surethey do become annoying when they happen Other times they are just hilarious like AI bugs This is another area that needs more polishsome RP polish and server stabilitynetcode polishthe game is a blast I completely recommend it Do I need to say moreso this game is getting more hate than I think it deservesthis game has a lot of potentialand people not picking the right server for them it will kill the game and never have the chance to live up to its potential that everyone wants to seethat will depend on what server you select Its the nature of the survival genre to have a toxic community and favor those who play more This game has a very nice feature that goes unnoticed by too many players that can fix that issue There are server types it brings up when you search for a game pvppvepverppvprpblah blah blahnot going to list all the combonations The beauty of that is there ARE SOME SERVERS that are heavily moderated and have rules and regulations such as not being allowed to raid people when they are offlineor not being able to just kill players with no purpose in mind or whatever your prefrences are pick the right server for you and the game will pay off far better for you in the long runin fact ive come to like it better than any other survivalcrafting game out there I suggest playing it and forming your own opinionI love roleplaying in this game helps me forget about my cancer As I push 200 hours I feel it is time to give a competent review of Conan Exiles in its current stateand from my perspective given the style and game mode we my wife and I are currently playing Just a notewe are diehard Conan fansand the given genre is right in our sweet spot having been avid ADD and Everquest players back in the daytaking far greater interest in games such as The Forest and Empyrion than games such as Ark which I played someand games like RustLife is FeudalDay Z7 D2Dwhich I sampled but never really got into I also greatly enjoy many of the single player survival games some of which are VR capable such as Subnautica While I consider myself equally PVE and PVP centric as a playerplaying ARK PVP was nothing short of a relentless and unproductive experience and despite some tenacious efforts to enjoy it on my partwas never fun to play However “ARK” in VR is nothing short of one of the greatest treats I have ever encountered as a lifelong gamer of many yearsand beta testing Shroud of the AvatarGloria VictisSavage Lands etc We have also basically played just about every MMO on the market including Conan for many years I would say we have extremely discerning taste when it comes to gaming and will happily take a quality game like Mount and Blade whose lack of graphics are easily made up for with content and replay abilitythe experience was tantamount to that which we had in ARK in that when you arent fighting relentless server issuesyou are contending with a completely unbalancedoften toxic population of people hell bent on making your in game experience anything but productive or pleasurable by utilizing the plethora of bugsglitches and exploits which currently riddle the PVP portion of the game I am confident that in timegiven the tenacity of the devs and their constant efforts to patch and improve the gamethat these issues will become manageable and we will revisit that element of the game in the future In the meantime the two of us are just playing PVE together on a private serverand truth be toldwe are absolutely loving the game In factfrom this perspectivethere is little to nothingsave some minor bugs here and there that we even dislike about the gamealbeit even simpler to learn and progress than in either of those games We have only slightly deviated from the default settings and are taking our time progressing through the content We are both around level 30 and have tried to balance our time between buildingleveling and exploringall of which are extremely rewarding in their own wayboth of which are powerful machinesand by comparison is in some ways more straight forward and rewardingas well as recipes and uses for that which you obtain from harvesting them If anythingthe fauna can be a bit overwhelming in the earlier stages of the game and act as kind of a meter suggesting by ones success or failure if it is time to move onor to stay put and improve gear and attributes a bit moresurvival or tower defense genres We dabble with the Dark Souls seriesbut Conan Exiles truly satisfied just about every aspect of our gaming needs Most importantlywe are having fun playing in a way so many games simply fail to deliverbut currently we are enjoying the aspect of the game we are playing and the experience is nothing short of a 1010 for uswith smaller clan size limits of perhaps five people per clan Obviously the more like minded the players are on the serverthe more enjoyable the experience will be for everyone Alasnot everyone has ten or twenty friends they can get to play the same gamebut this is one game which would truly shine above most given such a scenario We definitely look forward to the server issues being improvedand we remain encouraged by the obvious care and time the devs are continuously putting into the games development Until then we will continue to enjoy this great experience and look forward for more to come as the game progressesIt was good back in the day I bought this game solely to play Singleplayer offline Now I cantwhen Im traveling with a laptopor somewhere where I dont have a connection at allstart the gamechoose Singleplayeryou get the message that it cant connect to Funcom Live Services Thats ityou cant playI wont be able to play at all Ive had enough of thisbut its locked behind Online DRM False advertisingAfter being purchased by TENCENT you now need a connection to the funcom servers even for single playerApparently difficult to format this anymore One way to make sure truth stays obscuredthe company running it just cant figure out that if they are going to update  and ALL games NEED updating How to do it in a way that doesnt crush the spirits of the player baseI admit I am enjoying the game  precisely because I play on a Server with several Gigs of Community patches I mean MODS on itunless the got it for free or nearly soHonestly it can be a lotta fun and the graphics are good and the mechanics are fair as well but I do not recommend this due to the massive incompetence of the developer I can only see it sliding into oblivion and would save some poor soul from spending their cash on something in a tailspinIts too late for me but save yourselvesOfficial game servers are down and crashing And they TESTED this for upwards of a Month and didnt spot ANY of these totally game breaking issuesBack when this hit early accessI was hesitant Told my friends Id wait for it to release Got it on Humble a while back and finally installed itDarkout to SubnauticaIve played a lot of themIm playing on a private server with friends but thats how I always play these gamesif a little odd sometimes Having the optionthoughis awesomeits one of my top  EDIT AFTER being limb shit for years about the cheatersNOW they are banning PVE players and destroying their structures without so much as a noticeor even chance to correct it if FUNCOM decides it is against its vague rule bookwho is no expert on how game servers functionthat in attempts to save their gameFuncom has doomed it by turning against their own players And hell bethey cannot weather few puny cheatersso to feel in command they ban and demolish players with years of history in a single serverjust because some asswho joined talks smack on their forumsas you can tell I have over 4 000 hours in this gamemost of them Ive spent on Official PVP servers Ive started to play the game when it was still in bearly accessbseen its developments throughout the years With the most recent massive update bIsle of Siptahbour clan returned to the game with full forcewe enjoyed it very much and hoping that all the bad things that are possible in this game wouldnt follow us there How wrong were weafter a week server started crashingand global chat went wild about cheatersand cheaters we found indeedthey were meshing and using speedhack while going in to the meshes and destroying the cheaters is simple enoughcountering the thirdparty hacking software is on its own leaguebut some of the things that have been broken over the years are hatches and elevatorsvarious weaponsand now the whole cooking systembut there are things that have been going on for yearsthere is no server or a period of time when I have not encountered cheaters in this game or any of the servers Iv played on Now I knowthat Funcom is trying to fix these issues by implementing new measuresbut all in all I think that is wrongthe answer is more severe punishmentbpermanent bansbcame the cheatersthe official PVP server 6002 was full almost daily before the first clan that left due to cheatersand after our encounter with themour interests waned as wellspend countless hours on itand my money It irritates me that I cannot enjoy my money and time invested the way the developers intended because of cheaterand it irritates me that they dont permanently ban these peoplethey shouldnot with all the cheating going on on the serversand not taking good care of ustheir customers and source of incomeI really like this gamebut the 100gb mandatory updates make me want to PULL MY HAIR OUT I live in a very rural areaand my internet peeks at 12mbsso its a good 1hrs of downloading We rely on the internet for our phone and TVso I constantly have to pause the update  especially when my wife complains Last update took  daysand now Im having to do it all over again Why does Funcom make you download the entire game every time they patch Its extremely frustrating Give me an offlinepatch optional versionpleaseyoure rating your internetnot the game  youve completely missed the point There is this concept called usability When you purchase a productand cant control when you are able to use itthats an issue For 1 years I was a SSE for a big manufacturing firmso I understand the convenience of code modularization Funcom does not
1,So there I wasbuilding my factory with a nice daynight cycle after a while I noticed that it had been perpetually night for a really long time I chalked it up to a bug and continued building my bowl of spaghettion the far side of the planetbeing eclipsedIll keep it simpleconsidering the amount of time youll be enjoying themI have over 300 hours in this gameoften playing it all day long Its never crashed Its never glitched out or corrupted my save game Im at the point where Ive completed a Dyson Sphere and its never dropped a frame despite multiple planets literally covered in production lines Dyson Sphere Program  looks absolutely beautifulI could describe Dyson Sphere Program as Factorio in 3Dbut that wouldnt come close perhaps Satisfactory on more than one planet and with an actual end game goal would be a better fit Theres soso much morebut thats a good starting point I hate it when someone seems like theyre raving about a gamebut thats what Im about to do Theres a summary at the endif longwinded prattle isnt your style Saddle uphere we goI have 6 hours played and I only bought it 72 hours ago I played it for 15 hours in my very first sessionand only stopped because my wife insisted I get some sleep Ill admit that I left it running while I slept for about 9 hoursbut in my defense I was trying to break the game by flying to another star system remember No Mans Skybut have never launched a rocket I have over 1000 hours in Fallout two weeks of which was spent breaking the economy in survival mode with the workshop DLC by smashing tens of thousands of lunchboxes spoiler NukaCola is too heavy to be good for commercebut if you drink it you get a bottle cap Pens and pencilson the other handare weightless even in survival mode spoilerI unlocked my screen to find myself close enough to the system I aimed for to check out the planets in itand spent quite a while gleefully doing exactly that and taking notes I went on to visit several star systemsalthough none was nearly so long in journey time as the first trip I did some IRL things while I coasted through space at a mere 1000ms for an hour or two on my way to neighboring star systems that were only a few light years away As far as I can tellthe sole penalty for not using warp drive is that it takes bmuchb longer to get where youre going I regret being too impatient to research just a bit more before I left my home systemjust like in reality The letters roughly follow the alphabet in scale As an exampleSol our sunaka the star in our own isolari system is a G type staras is the star you start on in any new game F type stars are slightly hotterK are slightly cooler relatively speakingand there tend to be more of them They also tend to have large chunks of basic resources on them F type stars seem to be likely to have a relatively good selection of basic resourcesand to also be relatively comfortableif islightlyi less densely populated by planets than G type stars systems K and M stars seem to have more rare mineralsbut the very few planets are lets just sayless hospitable Lava or ice were prevalent features on manyif not most that I visited during my journey Btype stars have amazing amounts of resources on a fairtomiddling number of planetsbut those planets tend to also be slightly less pleasant than would be ideal Warm and dry would be a good descriptoralthough less hostile in general than the fire and ice I found at the KM end of the scale uThe only water oceans I found were in orbit around F or G starsubut did not visitboth a neutron star and a black hole as well as several red giants and white dwarf stars Im looking forward to visiting thosebut did not feel like 30 realworld hours of travel time could possibly result in a payoff that would be worth it I may come back and update after I achieve warp travelbut dont hold your breath spoilerleaning toward F type rather than K type if you have the option Skip M type and B type until youve got a solid logistics system andor can bring a base in a bucket with you uDont forget to bring fuel for the return journeyu unless your plan to get home is load a save fileand research warp drive before heading for another star It makes the journey much fastersound effects are stellarand positional audio is so immersive thank youdevs The graphics are topnotch for an Early Access title Its obvious that a lot of time and effort went into the art assetsand I dont actually feel like anything is missingat least in what Ive experienced so far OhI did encounter an unimplemented technology in the research treebut its labeled Work in progressits not selectableand skipping it doesnt prevent other techs from being researchedso the actual impact on gameplay is practically nonexistentand the grammar is kinda gnarly in placesbut I would imagine that will be polished to perfection when they get around to it and it still manages to imostlyi get the point acrossalthough I did have to read a few phrases more than once to understand the intended meaning To be fairIve seen worse spelling and grammar in titles that only had English as a language optionso this is perhaps another point to be impressed byrather than an actual issueabout 60 complete then I cant wait to see what it looks like once its actually finished Well worth the money I paid for it in its present stateand knowing what I know nowI would easily have paid twice as much Buy it before the price goes up this one is phenomenalStep 1 Make spaghetti factoryso you decide to make a bunch of planetary logistics systems and mass produce logistics drones in an attempt to literally cover the entire planet in an apocalyptic cloud of resourcetrafficking robotsWARNING This game will eat your time There were so many moments i wanted to exit then the sun rose and i saw what i had madethen played for at least 2 or 3 more hours I have some quality of life issues but jesus this game is too good to dwell on those Buy this is you like factorio and satisfactory but make sure you have a clear scheduleIm still trying out but this game seems fun Those who said that this game chews away time is obviously untrueand I certainly recommend it Jokes asideit does suck away a huge amount of time per session Handle with careI started playing at 6pmand before I knew itit was 7pm What a productive 25 hoursOh lordlet me just start out by saying that as soon as I got this game I played for 6 days straight until it was finished… for an average of 12 hours a day I abandoned responsibilitiesslept like  hours a nightand my room is a mess at the momentbut it was a fun rideand realized that career path was too much work so I got in to a programming careerand this game hits both of those aspects of me in just the right way Progression is fun and rewarding The game gives you very little in the way of explanations of things There’s an advisor like in Stellaris that gives you tips on how to play the gameeven a very minimal tidbit of lore about who you arethe state of humanity and what you’re doing It’s interesting… it’s just all in very poorly translated engrish It sounds like they hired a fluent English speaker to voice the advisorbut it also sounds like they paid him to read a script straight from google translate and he just said ‘hey so long as you pay meI’ll say whatever you want’so now you’ve just got this fluently english dude reading a halfunintelligible line and while many would see this as a detrimentI found it very amusing and endearing The funny thing isyou really don’t even need more than the halfunintelligible tips to figure out how the game works The game has a very low learning curveand is very intuitive They made a system that’s really fun to just mess with until you start to get a feel for how it worksand you continually expand and compound on what you learn The upgrade tree is very simpleyet engaging as well I like that the later tiers even have infinitely repeatable upgradesso if you just want to keep going after the end gameyou could just become ridiculously decked outand it’s already fleshed out enough to give me 70 hours of sheer enjoymentwell worth the price It still needs a bit of polishbut really already has a level of content that exceeds many comparable fully released games They’re very actively updating it and have added very many quality of life features just in the short few sleepdeprived days Ive played it It still has its flaws For instanceinformation matrices one of the core items you have to produce to win the game was the bane of my existence There are 5 main ‘matrices’ you progressively create manufacturing lines for plus a 6th final matrix made from the previous 5 combinedand these are then used for researching new technologies and personal upgrades Information matrices are the th tier of those 5and feels like it requires half the silicon in the known universe to make as many as you needafter all It’s a shame really I went to a black hole for shiggles onceand the way they rendered it was absolutely gorgeousI just had no reason to go there This game really is just beautiful… sometimes I would just sit in awe amongst the array of lights from my many conveyor belts watching the sunset as it was surrounded by a ring of dyson sphere nodes and the glimmering ring of the dyson swarm surrounding that Hats off to the modeling teamthey really outdid themselves with the beautiful and scientific aesthetic of it all And hats off to the coding team I was really struck by how you could just… fly into the air and you were in spaceseamlessly The entire universe was at your fingertips to fly to at any time with zero loading screens It’s not just an open worldit’s an open universe and every logistically complex miningmanufacturing plant you create on every planet keeps going even when you’re not there without overly bogging down your computer Color me impresseddon’t be too hyped for getting a bigcrazy ending I wont spoil anythingbut it’s very brief though there is some loreand it’s really only there to mark an end pointto tell you you’ve done just about all there is to do The beauty of this game is truly in the journeyand you can continue playing even after you’ve finished everythingI very highly recommend this gamebut only if you can spare a good 70 hours becoming utterly addicted to it I can’t recall a game I was as compelled to binge as this one in years For fellow technically minded sci fi nerds like methis game is absolutely worth itand then quadruple that infrastructure Silicon is going to be your most used resource by far late gamemostly for those dang information matriceseven once they’ve reached max efficiencyhave a ‘cap’ of how much power they can drawor how many critical photons they can produce Once the power your dyson sphere generates exceed the cap the ray receiver can drawonly then do you need to make another one I didn’t realize this til super late gameand thought I only needed one ray receiver and was like ‘wowmy dyson sphere does jack diddly for power demands’ Also Put ray receivers at the poles Light hits your poles all dayand so they never lose efficiencyor shells and such I didn’t realize this until late game too and was like ‘oooohhhhthat would’ve been helpful to know a lot sooner’Theres plenty of reviews on here comparing this game to Factorioand saying its a great game thats just like it This is 100 truebut instead of just adding the same stuff onto the pileI figure Id address some of the things Ive seen in the negative reviewseven though in reality youre placing buildings with a rectangle footprint on a sphereplanet and the fact that its 3d instead of Factorios 2D I havent had an issue placing blocks or buildings at all The only thing I would ask for is for blueprinting to be addedbut thats not something I would expect day 1 of early accessFactorio didnt even have it day 1it was added after about a yearbut nothing is hard to understand Here is an excerpt from one of the paragraphs in the game The Photon Combiner can convert lowfrequency photons into highfrequencyeffectively reducing solar energy loss from solar radiation Seems like a pretty coherent sentenceespecially when that is something I imagine would be a little difficult to translate It makes me wonder if people chose Chinese when it asks what language at the start of the game and are now complaining they cant understand anythingexcept for manually crafting larger number of items I would suggest maybe instead of the  by the produce buttonmaybe just a normal click makes 1shift click makes 10and ctrl click makes 100 But the technology tree is easy to useeven allowing for queuing of technologythe map is easy to usebasically everything except the manual production bitsince I do have a nice PC10th gen i7GTX 2070but I havent had an issue The game is capped at 60 FPS defaultand in the settings to bump it to a max of 100 I can run it just fine at 100but I leave it at 60 since thats good enough for me when it comes to a factory building game But maybe there are some issues on lower end hardwareI would hope as development progresses those issues get ironed outthis should be in the game As of launch its notbut I know its on the roadmap and they seem to think of it as a high priority But I agree with this oneI would love to change key bindingsbuilding big factories on planets is fun stuff I havent gotten to jumping around from planet to planet or system to systembut looking forward to it Id give the game in its current state a 75810 so farmain drawback is those keybindings P Once those are added Id go to a 859maybe higher depending on how fun the late game isand more development could raise my opinion of it even more Great fun for anyone who is into this type of gameAbsolutely overwhelmingly yesfactorio and a plethora of other such games where smart engineering is at the forefront of the gameplay itselfthis is practically a stealand for an early access title is one of the most polished and enjoyable releases ive seen in quite a whiletop seller in steams chartswith a 96 approval ratingyou cannot go wrong giving this a tryDSP is a game about putting things into boxes so you can build things to put in boxes so you can build boxes so big you can put stars into the boxes Boxesby the wayintrinsic logicelegance on a level Ive never seen in a video game before Also the graphics are nice There is nothing quite like standing at the north pole of your zen garden planet staring at your ten layer deep matryoshka sphere that you designed to look like youve created an origami swan with tesseracts folded through a variabledimensional n5 space and thinking to yourself about what the next one will requireBLUF My first save of the game was titledWhat time is itNo Mans Skyetc I was interested in factory games like Factoriobut the 2D perspective and overwhelming complexity was a bit of a turn off DSP looked like a bit more accessible version of factory genre plus a nice dose of space explorationso I took the plungethings feel really big when they are bigbut not so much so that it takes eternity to get anywhereto your solar systemthen the entire star clusterunlocking buildings and items as you go Finding rare resources and exotic stars and planets is really coolespecially when they are useful in your interstellar factoryMUCH LESS an EARLY ACCESS title A few placement issues with buildings and beltsbut very minor One crash in over 135 hrs of playyou dont actually have to build a permanent Dyson Sphere structure to beat the gameonly do a specific research that requires resources gathered from a star Since there a couple different ways to get this resourceyou dont actually have to finish a structure to beat the game A slightly odd choicebut I suspect is was done this way because it can take a REALLY long time to finish a sphere see more details below and giving the mission accomplished before the long grind sets in is probably a good thingits a bit surprising that there is no way to automate the rapid construction of buildings and the sorters required to interact with those buildings This becomes more and more of a problem in the middle to late game when you are making dozens of the same structures over and over again Mods like Copy Inserters and Multibuild are an absolute requirement to save you from clicking yourself to death  and this is coming from someone who generally tries to avoid using modsof the 135  hrs Ive spent on one play throughalmost half have been after mission accomplishment just waiting on my sphere to finish building Yesyou can make your factory bigger to speed things upbut scaling up your dyson sphere component production takes a LOT of repetitive factory building and a bit of resource whackamole There is nothing that is challenging from a problemsolving perspectivejust a matter of how much repetition can you put up with It would be really nice to see some higher level automation available Like some AI that you can command to go setup xx metal extraction at xx planet and bring it hereor something like thatbut definitely worth checking out in its current stateFactorio  Satisfactory  Planetary annihilation all you gotta knowDecades agoplaying video gamesI saw generation after generation improve on what could be done XCOM with maps that you

more fans than it has andeven discounting all the fun I had with it so farheres something else amazing I showed my young son me flying around a humaniform robot in outer spacebuzzing a sun and then warping to a black holeand he had a twinkle in his eye and I could tell bamhed be hit by magictoo 1010 would recommend and even if the devs abandoned itI would say this would be on my short list of games everyone should at least get their teeth really intobuildonly game Thats not everyones cup of tea If thats not youI STILL recommend you at least get a real taste of this genre pinnacleh1What is ith1very much in the same vein as Factorio  For anyone who hasnt played a game in this genre beforeit is all about mining a resourcethen creating a component with itthen transporting that component to another device to manufacture a more complex component  all with a view to automating it all and making some great machine that reaches the end goal of the gameSatisfactoryFactory TownShapezioProduction Line and morebut Factorio is its nearest comparison  The good news is that there is totally room in your library for both wellfor ALL of them  While both games offer exactly what makes this genre greatthey are both sufficiently different that you could play both simultaneously and not feel that one is better than the otheror one replaces the other   Dysons futuristic vibe is rendered in much better graphics than Factorios slightly more pixelatedflatter rendering and the scope of Dyson is muchmuch bigger given its space exploration and biggermuch more satisfying end goaland there is no enemy at allbut Factorio has a gritty steampunk vibe to it with a hostile planet that truly feels atmospheric and alienhuge maps with mass transport solutionsthe level of danger is greater and is more granular in the amount of components you will need to makethe gameplay automation much more detailed and complexand modding can give you a totally different game all over againthere really isnt one is better than the other  Get both  honestlyjust do thatits fair to say Factorio really cemented the genre in its own right  Factorio paved the way  Anything that comes along after WILL contain elements of Factorio as is inevitable  To say Dyson is a ripoff of Factorio is to say Dishonored is a ripoff of Thief  One might INSPIRE the otherbut basically Dyson is another title in a relatively new and extremely popular genre  Factorio deserves the credit for giving us this new type of game  Dyson should be applauded for giving us another game in the genre and taking it in a different direction  One has enemiesthe other does not One has space explorationthe other does not  As saidone is not a replacement of the other  fans of one will undoubtedly love the other tooyoure on your own  You know you need to create an energy sphere around your procedurally generated systems starbut how  The fun is in figuring that out  Every so oftenas you research and craft more componentsa new building will be unlocked and you wont always know what it does until you try it  You will be forever battling energy and resource limitationsbut that is the point of the game  creating a sustainable and stable energy source  The game never feels difficult to understandbut there is no handholding either  So you made that thing  now figure out what you can do with itI suddenly realised that the research tree is a bit misleading probably because other games of this genre pace their resource tree to span to the end of the game  But in Dysonresearch is just a fraction of the game  Ive unlocked nearly everything and have yet to make any significant inroad to building my Dyson Sphere  I realise that Im nowhere near the end goal yet  I have so much more to do  Right nowin FactorioI would be well on the way to building my rocket and escaping the planet  In Dysonyou are aiming for much more than a rocket  It is muchmuch bigger  I expect I will be playing my current playthrough for a long time to come as yetI say no  I have read criticisms about the space flight but I disagree  I think the flight model is more realisticbeing sucked into gravity fields of gas giantsovershooting a planet creating difficulties in swinging back for a return sweep  Another criticism Ive read is that the planets are so smallbut I think thats necessary to make resource management critical and can absolutely see why that design choice was made  Ive read criticisms about balancing issuesand there is a degree of that especially with chemicalplant related construction but that is an issue that is more a staple of this entire genre and not just specific to Dyson Sphere Program  I think the only criticisms that the developers do need to look at is firstly handling properly a lack of inventory slot when manufacturing something  especially something expensive like a logistics station because all those valuable resources are lost if no space is availableand also making the end goal essential  Right nowits not  I dont want to say too much because spoilersbut that does need addressing  Howevertaking into consideration that this title is still Early Accessthe absence of more major flaws is impressivethis games rating stands at 97 overwhelmingly positive  and thats with good reason  The fact its still in early access is a credit to its highlyactive and publicfocused developers as the game runs flawlessly  My only technical issue is that it does turn my gaming laptop into a hot toaster pretty quickly but that asideIve run into no problemsbugs or crashes at alland the bar has been set very high for the factory buildingproduction line genre of games  While it is clearly inspired by all the best of Factorios offeringsit also takes the game in a sufficiently different direction so that it doesnt act as a replacement or a blatant copy  I cannot recommend this game enough and it thoroughly deserves its overwhelmingly positive ratingThis game is absolutely addicting I kept thinking I would be able to put it down after hitting the next milestoneso far that hasnt happened I made some early mistakes with my first buildso bad that I restarted from scratch after about the first 6 hours After thatit was no looking back I obsessed over routing resources from place to placemoving and removing different conveyor belts and optimizing paths and output cadences Once the aerial logistics comes inthats when this game shines Seemingly overnight I went from plodding along to covering an ENTIRE PLANET with stuff Once the planet was fullI ended up using some of the other planets in the system that were otherwise totally uninteresting and useless  random volcanic worlds with scorching hot surface No problem Build stuff all over itthat would be totally annoying Insteadthis little robot  I know it says Icarus I call it Skippy  manages to keep an absurd abundance of hardware stored in higher dimensionsI have entire logistics systems devoted to logistics systems and basically at this point have a dozen planets pumping out components to build dyson spheres in a dozen other systemsgreat to immerse yourself in or have on in the background while youre working on other stuffalmost forgotits BEAUTIFUL Taking your Skippy up close to a black holes event horizon and coming back Checking out a stonetree planetwindswept plains of a desolate wastelandtropical paradisea funky AlphaCentaurilooking planet  its all just gorgeousDo not buy this Game  at this point I have been playing this Game for 150 hours and the game is not out that longI started the game uptook a drink of waterand suddenly 8 hours have gone byIts Factorio simplified  repackaged with a space themevisually very pleasing and no performance issuesbut its easy to find flaws and leave feeling underwhelmed
1,It would honestly be fair to call 2K an evil company at this point There are only two options either the company is staffed solely by incompetent developers who are incapable of creating a functioning game ORmuch more likelythey knowinglyannuallydecide to tighten the screws of their monopoly around the heads of literally millions of kids who shell out billions of dollars in revenue to this company every yearabysmal AIor the horrific optimization that is sure to make even a beginerlevel programmer cry himself to sleep Ihoweverthink it is much more interesting to talk about the scam itself to purposefully make the game unbearable throughout every facet of its gameplay The sheer malignance of such behavor is difficult to understand for normal peoplebut here it is important to understand how financial incentives choke the life out of every argument for game improvements that is not bounded in optimizing the revenue streamas far as I am aware Making the game unplayable is actually profitable If you dripfeed as little fun and engagement to your players as humanly possible and hide even this behind as many paywalls as possibleyou create the illusion that once you pay just a bit more the game will get fun but it just never does Its economics for elementary schoolersand it works magic Its a freemium game that you pay 60 euros for every year A cash cow only rivaled by the MaddenFIFA franchiseswho succumb to a love of basketball every yearand every year walk away disappointed The worst thing is that Ill probably keep playing Ill suffer through 1015 of every mycareer game consisting of advertisements and skippableafterawhile cutscenes Ill suffer through trying again and again for literally hours to get games in the rec centeronly for my teammates to lag out for the 10th timeor for the entire opposing team to consist of 110everythingwitheverybadgeinthegame hackers Ill get booteddcdlagged out in a hundred different wayswhile walking a tightrope trying to avoid the myriad of gamebreaking bugs and glitches that the game featuresso allow me to do it digitally plsall I can think about is how they can possibly be so disrespectful The solutions are not difficultthey are not even expensive or technically demandingand yet they will never be implemented It pays so much more dividends to invest in 2KTV or the new look of the neighborhood Its a slap in the face of every playerevery day of every week of every month of every yearand my unbridled disgust其他问不做表述，毕竟一个人有一个人的喜好。只说一点，PC平台公园90的外挂，难道就没一点办法？公园开挂，改体型不封号，刷徽章刷VC立马封号。合着你的利益不容侵犯，玩家的利益肆意践踏？There is very little difference from 2k20 The only difference is the shot meter All icon are the samecut scenesits quite astounding how little has changed Feels exactly the same Therere not even trying anymorewhat a jokesame bugs also Have to be in window mode for Sim to work Like fix something at least TerribleDO NOT BUY This game is trash and isnt a complete game and will only get worse They are releasing next gen which is basically an entire new gamenew myplayer creationsnew city in myplayerand you CANNOT play on this with PC Next gen is not coming to PC Makes no sense considering the game was probably created on a damn PC This game was half useful for the first however many monthsnow going to be completely useless with next gen in the picture Wow Did not expect this from 2k DO NOT BUY Cant believe they made everyone buy this game knowing the sleezy s they were about to pull to make everyone purchase next gen Another big F U to Ronald Ronald always ruining this damn gameDont buywait for next year or get 2k20PS5 and XBox X players get the actual new gamePlayed for an hour and relised I alredy own this game so I refundedPC version is  patches behind console with no plans on releasing them or feedback to the PC community The game was just abandoned after launchJust get 2k20 or 2k19 or 2k18 I mean at this point go play actual ballThis is what happens when you dominate without competition to keep you honest  You can put anything out there and know it will sellwellbecause you can  I will not refund this game but I do want to say its exactly like NBA 2K20 except for a few new things  So I pity 2K Sports because of COVID right  but lets have a COVID game price right  Why are we shelling out 60 dollars for nearly the same product as last year  Simple answer Because they can The endIngame ad for a full price game SeriouslyWait its all the sameThis game is objectively the same game as 2K20not only branded as a new game at a 60 price tag but it also disgraces Kobe Bryants memoryand all of these changes couldve been implemented in a tiny game update for MyCareeronly to find out that you need to spend another 50100 to actually have a character with any semblance of NBA talentskill or optionally you can suffer through 50100 games of absolutely awful and boring gameplay with a 40 overall playertoo goodawkward animations in general make the game play like Madden and that is not a good thingwhich has a massive weight in the overall systemthus boosting your overall to make it appear your player can runjumpdribble a basketballand etc which they cant do until your player is heavily upgradedbut they couldnt hire anyone to port the nextgen game to PC They didnt tell us PC wouldnt be getting the nextgen update until the new consoles launched If you dont knownextgen 2K21 actually has a lot of improvements and is a substantively different and better game than 2K20 and 2K20 20 This game is a 60 roster update marketed off the tragic death of a basketball legend Dont buy this garbage Stick with 2K20 if you already have it If its cheaper than 21of course buy it insteadnot made for the pcdevelopers just dont careCopy and paste gameplayawfulcheating AIlazy developers Embarrassing effort I remember back when 2K was really goodbut thats goneI actually spent money on this gamejust to have all my files corrupted Which is totally my faultknowing 2K is a scam company This company literally does zero work to improve any aspect of the game and used the death of Kobe Bryant as a marketing ployI was suprised I had to download 85 GBthey could have just taken 84 GB from the already installed 2k20Paid 59€ for a patchNEXT GEN ON PC PLEASEHonestlyI am a big 2k fan As much as I want to make this a positive reviewI just cant Game feels too empty Especially in MyCareer which I play the mostI havent encountered any singe cutscene Super disappointingpregame showsdugout cams Everything seems to be emptySowhere to begin  Iflike meyou love basketballmaybe you once collected cardsand you enjoy games with management elementsthis game has elements that touch all of those interestsyou should stay farfar away  This is one of those playingitfor100hoursbeforeyouaskamIreallyhavingfunanduninstalling kind of games  Its incredibly frustrating becauseit could be so goodmultiple game modesa steady supply of new challengestheres a mycareer modeetcauction houses exploitative this is no different  Its a trick to make you feel likeif you sell your 15th duplicate cardyou didnt totally just waste your actual moneyfranklythey need to create a practice mode that simulates the 00 ms delay you often feel when you press the shoot button so you can practice compensating  many gamers eventually turn off the shot meter and just use visual cues because its so lagged out and deceptive  Ive played games that have guns shooting bullets you knowsomething whose speed and responsiveness should be much harder to simulate that do waywayway better than this basketball game  Battlefield 4 had less rubber bandingat firstfun  Eventuallyyou realize that they keep trying to force you to play in unnatural ways to earn rewardssomething that I first experienced with the Battlefield assignment system and eventually contributed to me quitting that series after  games  Let me explore the game my way  Stop pushing me to achieve some dumb statistic that isnt about strategy or winning or having fun  Keep them simpleyou askreallyall I need is those shinynewgood cards to win  I keep getting matched against people with ridiculously overpowered cards  Yesthere are free cards you can earn  The most damning part is that I have probably lost 20 or 0 games simply because the other playerof lower skillbought overpowered cardsequipment  Im oknot great  Im also way better than when I started I meanI better be  So why am I losing so much more and to players that are much more limited that me  Im put in matches to get me to spend money thanks patented 2K VIP systemsyesbutpart of capitalism is also not spending money to further unbalance a game designed to be unbalanced  I just want to collect cards  Make it so I dont have to constantly ignore and be pressured to play toxic multiplayer to earn the cards I wantthats finebut here are some suggestions that I think wouldpretty easily and agreeably improve the gameadditional mode see2K  a new mode to market on the box Im only thinking of you called Card Collector Mode or something like that for people that want a SINGLE PLAYER ONLY MyTeam that doesnt keep pushing you towards multiplayer where youll realize you suck without those awesome cards and be soooo tempted to buy packs  I dont even care if packs are part of the mode and introduce new versions of playersjust strip out the dripdripdrip of pressure to play multiplayer  Some of us just want to enjoy playerscurrent and historicalscenariosand balanced challengeslower cards against brandnew4threvisioncardofthesameplayer Dark Matter Wilt  If I want to match my Hero cards against other people that are playing with the same cardsmake it happen  Its quite disheartening to grind for a playercardcome to enjoy it for a short whileand then realize three weeks later that you cant use that awesomefun player card anymore without getting embarrassed by a lower skilled player with players from new OP packsdo MyTeam CoOp and CoOp matchmaking against the AI  Coop is out of fashionand yesyou could play in the Playground to do some coop stuffbut wouldnt teamdeck building for a CoOp in MyTeam against the AI bejustfun  Short game modes and scenarios onlyfor surebut come on  Do it I say do itbut Im pretty sure Im never playing another 2K sports title let others enjoyhave players live pick their cards in alternating fashion1 by 1certainly for Triple Threat  Yesitd add like 90 seconds to a match but itd also build more actual strategy into the team selection rather than dumb luck  It also might more elegantly allow peoplelike meto quit if Im not wanting to do my 8th straight match against Galaxy Opal Giannisafter an online matchgive a small VC bonus to the opposing player if they wereyou knownice andor a good challenge  Having some positive incentives might actually curb some of the toxic behavior FYI the PC online community is decentmediocre  This opinion is influenced mostly by my console experience on Playstationwhich is a cesspool  And yesI own the game twice because Im an idiot  Ive actuallyoccasionally played against someone I had fun playing againsteven when I lostand itd be great to actually support those folks  Honestlythe metrics of this sort of feedback system should also be incorporated into matchmaking to groupummore compatible player typesno jokeinvisible players in some games against the AI  Optimize your graphics  Using the most standardbest camera anglevery subtly labeled 2Kis the camera angle that will shank your graphics card and create frame pacing issues every time the transparency of the backboard comes into view  Fix the issues created by a framerate over 60 just dont go over 60especially in MyCareer while simulating time when youre on the bench Just dont  Fix the fact that the gdamn player cardsTHE PLAYER CARDSare the thing that will drive your graphics card and Playstation into hysteresis  Your system will start to taxi the runway every time you decide to check out your Heat Check playersI promisebut it absolutely does not love them back  Dont believe me  Check out an NBA 2k21 focused youtube channel  Check out the content near the end of a season  Theywe are exhausted andhonestlymiserable  The high of getting the card will show upforlike minutes of the videoexperienceand then its back to the same sweaty reality  What you just worked hard to get will beby designmuch less usable and fun in a monthtops
1,Joined squad name Company BIyati dont know Russian tooThis is the middle ground between BF4 and ArmASquad is fasterSquad has cinematic actionSquad has dozens of full games running constantlyand servers that stay fullSquad is harderSquad has lots of people who care about strategySquad engagements can be different every timewith a hundred players in a square kilometer400m engagements are commonand you think a bullet to the chest should be fatalSquad is your gameARMA meets Battlefieldwith a splash of Foxholedemanding of you a certain level of tactical awareness and teamwork The game also does a ruthless job of punishing lone wolves and bad leadership Howeverdont let the realism dissuade you from itbecause once you get past the learning curveits an incredibly fun game with a huge amount of depth and complexity that will keep you hugely entertained and engagedrawand yetexciting and fresh Every single time you playeven on maps with the same layout and same factionsyou feel like theres a potential for something newsomething unprecedentedevery single time Fallujah is especially terrifying and immersiveand every time you step into that mapyou tensely look down each alleywaynot knowing whats going to come outand landed in the middle of a match about to kickoff As part of the US troopsI faced off against the Middle Eastern Alliance I joined a squadand grabbed a medic kitbecause I always liked the healer roleand I thought it would put me safely in the backline to learn the ropes while the others in my squad did the heavy liftingasking who was newand giving us some guidelines He told us not to give up if we went downand to wait for the medic to try and get us for at least 30 secondsor else it would cost a ticket the points that end the game if your side goes down to zero As the truck rolled offI looked back at the arsenal of armoured vehicles and asked why we werent taking them The squad leader replied that it was because losing them would cost so many tickets that it was better to use them sparingly rather than as some kind of overwhelming force doctrineand ours soon broke off from the packto form a backline FOB The squad leader pointed out things he wanted us to buildwhile telling us he was on the channel with command After we were done buildingwe sat around guarding the newlybuilt FOBnot an enemy in sightidly chatting and kicking stones around This felt like an accurate military simulator already Then suddenlyhe told us to get back in the truckwe were told we were meeting up with another squadwhich was under heavy fire and needed reinforcements I sat in the front watching the viewnext to the squad leader and the driverand thenthe truck grinding to a halt I turned to my squad leaderwho yelled PRESS F1 GET OUT GET OUT ENGAGEpanicking at how long it took I fumbled three timesmiraculously getting out unscathed from the hail of bullets smashing into the front window All around me little blips were showing up demanding medical attention as soldiers in our squad went down one after the other The squad leader yelled SETUP THE MG AIM AT THAT HOUSE OVER THERE before hetoowent down I couldnt even see where the bullets were flying from All I heard was shrapnelricochetand screams of MEDIC HELPholding out my medkitcursing its ineffectiveness before realizing I needed bandages to stem the bleeding first before healing I got my bandages outand the person I was tending to keeled over I took too long I desperately went to the next manwho I got back up on his feetbut he stood up and immediately got shot down again from a direction I couldnt identify As I tried to get him up againa hail of bullets sent me down tooI couldnt make out anything Just a voice goingI got youI got you in my ear When youre upgo prone on the ground and crawl after meI was awakethe light hitting my face The other medic in the squad had prioritised me I looked back at the wreckage of the truckstrewn with dead US troops The MG gunner was still firing blindly at the buildingbut he was the only one left A smoke grenade lay on the groundspewing thick white fumes The other medic explained to me I needed to pop smoke grenades so I could safely rescue others and let them crawl to safety under the cover of the fumes He yelled at the MG gunner to get up and join us under the cover We decided to complete the mission to meet up with the other squad as the SL directed while the others rallied elsewherewe crossed this maze of alleyways The MG gunner took point with his pistolhis MG having run out of ammo after the earlier encounter We noticed an engine rumblingchecked our mapsand realized it was a friendly one We ran outconfident we were safeand then an MEA soldier stepped out from an alleyway Too latewe emptied our weapons at himkilling himbut not before the RPG went into our friendly APCblowing its tracks out Shortly afteranother missile from God knows where slammed into the APC as we fired in all directions The MG gunner yelled outRUN before he got downed The other medic turned and threw a smoke grenadeshortly before bullets started flying and he went down as welland heard a chaos of radio static and panicked calls for help and for orders The smoke grenades fumes floated up I crawled on all fours to reach the other medicpatching him and bringing him up Then I crawled into the buildingleaving my comrade to patch the MG gunner The buildings floor was strewn with US soldiers incapicitated everywhere it seemed like every guy I patched got up only to be shot down seconds later WHERE THE HELL WERE THE BULLETS COMING FROM The other squads leader grabbed the medic from his squad and ran out the buildingshouting that he was going to setup a rally away from the fightingleaving his men in the bloody firefightmy revived SL and the rest of the squad opened fire from another building they had occupied The enemy was under enfiladegetting fired on by two sides Artillery rained down on them I cheeredwooping as they were surely obliterated As I stumbled out of the buildingmy SL checked my stats and remarkedWell doneyoure doing good for a new medicthat was the first skirmish We havent even flipped the first flag yet Come on Onto the objectiveI think to myself dear Lordwar is hellAfter several thousand hours of playing this game over the course of 3 yearsI guess I can review itand you basically will not win a match if your team does not work together This is glaringly obvious when you are on a team that is not working together The game has decent visuals and is more hardcore than many other shooterswhich if you like low TTKstrategic positioningand general small unit tactics then this game will mostly cater to you This game is really fun if you play it with players who actually understand military concepts as you can accomplish much more The game is not so rigid that it is a milsim however The mechanics are not well explained so the time you spend trying to excel at mastering the game will feel fulfilling when you see improvement in your skill It tries to be a middle ground between ARMA and Battlefieldand I can safely say thatyeah it does at least come closebut I feel it leans a bit more towards battlefield minus destructive environments and little to no customization The community leaders are generally helpful to players wanting to try the gameand dedicated servers means that hackers are hardly a problem Modding really increases the cool factor of the game and adds contentwhile willing to help new players is just as quick to dismiss or demonize and try to ruin the experiencereputations of their fellow playersserversclans The clans can be cool while you are in thembut they often get toxic fast As the game can get very competitive it really draws in a lot of tryhards who are not the nicest If you are a seasoned playerthe constant influx of new players from free weekendssales can drive you nuts with asking questionsnot knowing the gameand playing the game like Call of Dutyor by just being extremely toxic like its CSGO TBH you cant really blame them too much because there just isnt a tutorial that is indepth enough to cover every thing or enough to tools to handle the issues Eventually though they leave or adapt and the game will generally play better again Admins are not always present so the game can sometimes be play at your own riskyou will spend most of your ingame time warning or banning people and outofgame time getting shit on by players who dindu nuffin and want you to unban themor getting trolled by groups who are bored Most players have no loyalty to any one serverand so adminsplayers will flip flop to new placesrequiring you to constantly look for staff or playersand on top of the issues i mentioned you will spend hours every day trying to populate your server to get a match going If you dont have a clan or large community willing to try to populate dailygood luck Additionallysome of the guidelines that the devs want you and your admins to stay within do seem kind of limitingI do not foresee the game staying popular for very longas I feel a competitor may outdo the current product fairly soon ie BF3 reality modplaying the gamenote not admining a couple times a dayor every once in a while with some close friends preferably ones with military experience and ones who are mature enough to handle losing will give you the best experience Dont play this game for more than a few matches a day or you may go insaneCan the game be amazing and fun  yes Do I recommend this for everyone  Nothe game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armorthen proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawnthen you may experience a great sense of teamplay  other times not so muchif you do not communicaterunning of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked killedespecially if youre new to tactical shootersyou need a drivergunnercommander and possibly a loader has a machinegun Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bouncebut even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rearhere are my personal tipsshadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility game looks better with them thoughbut remember to join a squadgenerally it isnt worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m Sometimes it is the right choicebut before you know which is whichits a good idea to hold on for a medicdo not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a foolthan attacking But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyonewith indepth enough mechanicswhile also being easily accessablecheck out some lesser known streamer playing it bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is likeI might have 380 hours in this gamebut I still have no idea who am I shooting atLike ARMA except you dont have to pretend that youre having funmy wife also left me while i played  this game  very realisticImagine instead of writing Shakespeare you get 50 monkeys together to create and execute a military operation against another 50 monkeysIve have over 3k hours on this gamefrom CQB to long range to hit boxesSquad is a game that strikes the middle ground between Battlefield and Armabut Im sure youve heard that before Ill be a bit more specificand then half coordinate what youre going to do Usually sneaking behind enemy lines and getting that Conquest Flagthen this game probably suits you The gameplay is essentially your Squad Leaders talking to each othertrying to coordinate what to do Then they relay to their Squads what the plan is Then you do that thing Simpleright Wellnot quite There are a lot of moving parts in each game Ill explainsuch as GrenadierRiflemanMarksmanLight and Heavy AntiTankMachine Gunner with three variationsand some other funky ones like Combat Engineer and Raider That isnt including vehicles crewmanpilots Each game will be diffferentas Squad Leaders changeSquadmates changeand with each map change you often have to readjust your squads strategy and role kits to best suit the plan If you were the previously mentioned Battlefield player with a modicum of strategythen youll fit right in with being a Squadmate under a Squad Leaderand for your first few games I would recommend either Rifleman or Medicjust to get your bearings and start understanding the game I would also recommend telling your Squad Leader that you are newthat way they will better know your skill level and plan accordingly I personally have only met one or two Squad Leaders who say they dont want new peopleso if you run into one like that you can always switch Squads or Servers I would also HIGHLY recommend having a micit doesnt matter if its amazing as long as it works and people can hear you clearlythen I would say to branch off and try to play Machinegunner and Light AntiTank dont take Heavy After a few more games of thatlets say youre at 815 hours Then I would personally say you are more than welcome to branch out into either more complicated and niche Squad roleslike Combat EngineerOR you can move onto Armour or Helicopterstherefore I will touch on it only briefly Armour I am spelling it with a U as I am Canadianit is not a typo is fun if you like blowing other vehicles sky high and being afraid of towns You will most likely be enemy vehicle hunting for most of the gameand providing support to infantry so that they can capture a point or destroy an enemy FOB youll learn what FOB is in gamebut it is essentially a playermade base that you can spawn and resupply on If you get really really good at armouryou and a couple friendssquad mates can pretty much solo win games againif you play really well and coordinate with your team even better WellI guess this wasnt brief Oh wellnextgetting information for your teamand being the hero who picks up an entire squad while hovering inches from a cliff If you enjoy being chill and playing the long gameand having brief moments of extreme intensitythen helicopter pilot is the way to go Just dont become Black Hawk Down and lose your team tickets after you have been playing for 2030 hours and have a basic concept of most things in the gameyou canshould hop into Squad leading If you want to be an effective Squad leaderyou have to incorporate everything youve learned in the past 30 hoursand use that to help your team win the game Just like when youre first starting out I would recommend telling your allied Squad Leaders that you are new to Squad Leading Its helpful for other Squad Leaders to know You canshould in my opinion tell your Squad that you are new to Squad Leadingbut not the gameand that while you may not be the bestyou will try your bestyou can try out Commander after some games Squad Leadingbut to do it effectively I would recommend having a lot of SL games OR joining a Clan It sounds weirdbut many Clans will help newer players and experienced ones learn the gameand their desired specialization such as Squad Leadingany Squad roleHelicoptersor Armouredjust to make it a balanced reviewtutorialand will curse out other players or intentionally make bad calls to lose the gamelike leveling or weapon level The only thing to show how skilled you are is your skill Its kind of a 5050 conprodepends on your opinionespecially ones with varying skill levels If you just stay polite and continue trying to winyoull be aokayand the learning curve is difficult for someone unexperienced in this type of game I myself never really played a strategic shooter unless you count Tarkovwhich I count as a tactical shooter before this gameso learning to work with everyone and come up with plans at the beginning was difficultand then suddenly their team starts silently taking out your HABFOBs from behind Suddenlyyour last HAB is being overrun and you lose the game shortly afterbecause you cant reinforce the objective in time Take from each loss a lessonso that you can move forward with experienceSquad isnt a game for everyone There isnt a progression system or a battleroyale modebut what it does have is engaging gameplay with tons of room for growthconstant replayabilityand an amazing community If you even think that you MIGHT like this gamebuy it on steamhumblebundleor wait for a free weekend they are pretty common If you stick around after your first few hoursthen that means that youll be around for a long time coming Thank you for reading this long reviewand I hope to see you out there soonh1One of the few multiplayer games that reminds me that people can be amazingh1Ive seen some sht Ive seen people crumbleIve lost friendsIve watched people eat each other even when they are winning When people are supposed to be working together and yet they would rather treat their ally like trash because they refuse to take the blame for their own wrongdoingexecuteand accomplish masterful plans to outsmart their enemy Ive seen teams rally from the depths of defeat and flip unwinable games into incredible victories Heros emerging from the storm of mortars landing upon their bunkerto squad leaders risking their own lives to save those of their squadyou must communicatework togetherand form a bond with the soldiers at your side You are a teamyou are a unitand you will never win alone Be it a medic patching the wounds of your comradesa logistics driver supplying your team with the supplies they need at the front lineor a squad leader putting the responsibility of 8 individuals on your shoulderseach person is a vital component of the teamSquad has now become my most played game on steam The depththe peoplethe comraderieits an amazing experience that no other game captures I encourage you all to try it out on a free weekend as I originally didI have been playing it ever sincePlays on a Afghan map on the US Teamcant scatter due to constrained wallsgo prone and jump on the Grenade and begins to cheer for my selfless sacrificeSo for reference Im a child playing an advanced military simulation and I join one of my first gamesI spawn in and immediately my squad leader brings me over to an anti tank weapon and just tells me to blow everything that goes down the road the fuck upserious goofballsor legit fucking monkeys its greatespecially if you are newask them what you gotta do and youll have an amazing experience Now go buy this fucking

god follow these 34 stepsAfter just reaching 1000 hours in SquadI can say wholeheartedlythat this game was worth every pennyand every hour I have owned this game since it was just a foundation of what it is todayand never did i ever think that this game would evolve into what it is today The development team is very proactiveand does a really good job of listening to the playershelicopter transportartillery barrages when you least expect them To say this game is immersive is quite an unfair understatement I wish i had a heart rate monitor on sometimesas things can get seriously hairy Like defending the police station on the new map Mutahaall by yourselfagainst  25 something US soldiers and a Bradley IFV Youre positioned across the streetand have an angle on just about everyone With so many targets and potential ways to die you begin to sweat a littleyour hands begin to feel clammy as you lay your iron sights against your unaware enemy Who do I shoot first Once I engagewho will notice first How will I react This game is in a way a three dimensional game of chessexcept the chess pieces are camoflauged in the treesand have the firepower to scare even the most battle hardened veteran playersI have yet to find any other game that lets one person wreak so much havoc upon a large group of enemies I have walked around corners unsuspectingly to find 5 enemies in the same compound as Iall bunched togetherand i was able to switch to full auto and mow everyone down with one magazine before making a hasty retreat Ohand lets talk about hand grenades While these are a common item in most shooter gamesIve never felt as much impending doom as ive felt in Squad when I see one of those tossed over the wall of the compound im in Ive seen one tiny hand grenade tossed directly into the center of a compound take out close to half of my team once Imagine  or more people all with microphones screaming GRENADE in unisonwith audible terror in their voicesand scrambling to find something to hide behind that can withstand the blast Most dont make it  I know i didnt Now ill recognize that familiar Pop of a grenade being tossed anywhereand in my opinion gives one of the most fulfilling gaming experiences possible
1,car go fast make sadness go bye byegreat game only thing thats negative if your a veteran player from windows store your saved game cannot be transferred over to the steam version which is the only reason i bought the game again gonna have to refund this onePros This game is addicting and has lots of contentVery well optimized Can run high settings at 7080 fps with a 100tiFinally I can stop playing The Crew 2 for the rest of my life Its the best arcade racing game with frequent content updatesGraphicsh1SMOOTH RIDING WITH A FEW BUMPY ROADSh1I am going to get this out of the way If you are planning to buy this game and wondering which version to getask yourself this If you are a minimaliststandard is fine If you want the expansionsget ultimate Deluxe on the other hand I think is worth skipping entirely If 9999 is too much for you for Ultimatejust wait for a sale Ultimate is definitely my choice for recommendation The amount of content you get is impressive and worth the price of admissionwith a roster of over 700 cars with Ultimate And also a racing enthusiasts dream playground with a decently sized map with tons of racing variety and events to play around with I have tons of racing games on Steam personallyand none have held my interest as much as Forza Horizon 4 Its a shame though that this came so late to Steam But even stillI got my moneys worth with over 120 hours of playtime at the time of writing thisit is not The Steam version is hampered with some unfortunate bugs People may experience random crasheswhich while not happening often after the last few updatesstill do happenas this game is a few versions behind the Microsoft stores own version Something I dont know if will ever be fully fixed Also online racing can be hit or miss with issues Those issues usually lie in the wait times sadlyso it might be offputting for those looking to race with others Luckily there is more than enough content without having to do online races to keep most people happyjust because more often than notthe game does run smoothlywhich includes many race events ranging from your standard street racesdirt tracks and even full blown off road events There are also other events which include speed trapsdriftingmassive jumpspromotional events like racing the Halo Warthogracing against trainsand moreand some cool little story events like racing for Top Gearor even opening your own businesses Theres plenty of content for sure If you decide to get the expansionsyou get other mapsincluding Fortune Islandwhich iswellan Islandcomplete with both low and high altitude locationslots of off roadingsome impressive night time visuals Aurora Borealis anyoneand more You also get the Lego Speed Champions map which is a fun and impressively designed map based on the Lego toys which features its own variety of fun and unique settingsincluding a beach riddled with pirate shipsa haunted lighthousea stunt arenaand more Also it gets its own radio station that plays just 1 song on loop If you guessed that song is Everything is Awesomeyoud be rightBoth expansions also come with a unique way of progression and their own vehicles to collect Fortune Island will have you progress to unlock a variety of treasure huntsthat each unlock 1 million creditsand the Lego expansion has you doing different tasks to collect studs which can be used to build your house and also collect new cars Both expansions will also include a majority of the types of events you will be used to in the base gamewith their own unique flairyou can custom tune each vehicle to your own likingwith a variety of parts and overhaulsincluding full blown engine swaps For those who are not gear headsthe community has you covered and you can even download custom tunes from others Forza Horizon 4 is one of the most generous racing games I have ever played with the sheer amount of cars they dump on you You can win cars from events You can win cars from wheelspins you can win cars from leveling up You can win cars from performing certain tasks You can win cars from barn findswhich are like little treasure hunts You can also buy cars from both an auto showor take your chances at an in game auction housewhich is also a great way to make moneyto wellbuy more cars BasicallyHorizon does not let you down with the cars Its like Pokemon for car lovers And once you have that dream cardont forget to give it that unique look Most cars can have some visual parts swapped outranging from spoilers to bumpers and moreand you can add custom designs to the paint jobs too Want to race around in Jurassic Park Jeep Want to race around in the Bandit 1 from Smokey and the Bandit Forza has you covered And if you just want to look at the cars in all their gloryForza also has a nice little feature called Forzavista which allows to do things with your car like opening and closing doorsand for some vehicles you can open up trunks and hoods and look inside at the engines If you get the James Bond packyou can even look at those nifty little gadgets like the machine guns mounted to some of the Bond vehicles Pretty neat stuffis Forza Horizon 4 worth it Id say yes𝐡𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐨iThanksMicrosoft for adding this masterpiece game to Steam iThis Game ended my long term relationship with NFSGood for the soulparticularly when it comes to ramming a Bugatti through a dry stone wall at 20mphForza Horizon 4 is remarkable game Its a racer thats for everybodyinstantly accessible for people who dont play racing gamesbut with enough depth and difficulty to satisfy gamers who prefer simulation The very premise of Horizon 4 is fun The quirkybouncy voiceovers and the festival vibe keeps things free and lighthearted Races are aimed at creating tightbalanced races that are fun no matter what vehicle you driveand it does this well Its fun to just jump in a random race you findmultiple race disciplines keep things interesting and all are genuinely fun If you get bored of one discipline you can jump in another and get the hang of it really quickly It doesnt force you through awkward drifting minigames or shift orientated drag racesthe cars and environments are photorealistic Set any screenshot as my desktop background and I wouldnt even suspect it wasnt the Lake District The cars themselves look fantastic lighting is done very wellso Winter is good for dirt for exampleand Summer more for road racingand that can get frustrating if you want to change seasons Seasons are locked to the serversmeaning every week they changeyou cant change them in game by moving ahead seasons for example Each season though does look amazing in its own wayand adds diversity to game campaignwellpolished and full of cars and stunning environments One more for the casual crowd but fun nonethelessa fantastic celebration of car cultureh1FinallyMicrosoft makes the moveh1just waiting for them to release on steam platform There’s no way I will ever buying games from Microsoft storenot even nfs will come close to it The game right now has sheer amount of content since it first release Lots of carsmap is huge and packed in lot of nice details Wants street racing You got it Off road There you go You can also relax and coast around in your favourite classic carexploring the country side Climbing rough terrain with 4x4 to the top of the mountain with your friend The game has almost near to infinite replayabilityeven with my old potato 1660tiim able to run at steady 7090fps with mix of ultra to high settings Although I encountered stutter during the cutscene transition every time I finished a racebut I believe devs are working on it since it’s a known issuethe bpriceb A lot of people are excited when Microsoft announced FH4 are finally coming to steam But when the game was releasedpeople were greeted by the overpriced tag instead Luckily in my regionthe price of the game is almost 0 cheaper on steam when compared to Microsoft storeIts finally time to get rid of The Crew 2 once and for allh1 Greedy Devs h1I have a lovehate relationship with this game On one hand its the most fun simcade driving game that Ive had the pleasure of playing over the last few yearswith hours upon hours of contentamazing graphicsand a really good car selectionits straight up THE most miserable multiplayer experience I have ever had with any game in my lifeyou can wait up to 1 MINUTES to get into one matchwhich takes lasts like 3 to 7 minutes at most And THEN the game might just spontaneously crash whenever it feels like it It seems to have gotten better since the Steam launchand any support tickets were marked as answered even if the issue wasnt solved Instead of actually fixing the problemwhich was clearly on their endtheir support deflected instead and put the blame on the players themselves Only when the servers went down completely and enough people started complaining about it after 2 weeks since the issue has started they actually started doing somethingand even thenit took them one week straight to actually fix the problemsince Steam doesnt have that optionthe core gameplay is so much fun that I would still highly recommend this game if youre into racing games Just dont set your expectations for the multiplayer aspect of this game too high because youre just going to end up as disappointed as I amh1 DO NOT BUY THE STEAM VERSION h1either buy a key for the Microsoft Store or buy Game Pass Since people are saying the price is normal in my country I should probably state the fact that Im talking about countries that use the Euro currencyruns flawlessly on ultra on the Microsoft Store i7 6700K16GB 3200MhzGTX 1060 6GB1TB SSDit really doesnt Hopefully the developers fix this in the futureI will be buying the Ultimate Edition on the MS Store for the price I paid for this from a keysite or by using the Game Pass dealthe game is a fantastic arcade racing experience for everyone to enjoy and one of the best racing games of all time in my opinion and its just really sad and disappointing that this port is this awful compared to Microsofts other Steam ports such as Sea of Thieves and Halo99  €6999 €70 is 8344the game does not receive active bug fix development or bugfixes and rather leaves the game in a broken state for a month or two until the next major patch comes alongonly a few of the issues I listed in the review above are actually mentioned by the dev team to be a known issue You can check out the page yourselfbut the developer of the game is working on it “The Forza team is aware of issues related to stuttering and wheel support and keeps players updated on progress via the Forza Support page We’re always listening to the community and looking for ways to evolve the game but have nothing further to share at this time” the Microsoft spokesperson said quoteh1BurnoutNeed for Speed and Test Drive Unlimited had a threesomeh1great selection of carsfun gameplaygood controls and physicsI wanted to play this game for years But xbox app was testing my patiencebut mostly its arcadea fun onewhere laws of physics still exist and different cars handle differentlybut theyre tiring while Forza is relaxing in a way Wellyou can make it relaxing or challenging Its the most fun racing game on the marketyou can drift which requires some effort unlike in other games Its just that awesome feelingfun and slightly realisticsomething like 700 maybe Cars have classes and the selection is very diverse From vintage cars to modern supercarsfrom regular road cars to rally cars or even trucks or vans There are even Lego and hot Wheels cars Just insanemore expensive cars Fortunately you can choose whatever car in exhibition races but still it lack progressionof course you can drive however you like but still coming from other games like ETS2 its a bit confusingespecially the roundabouts Not in a bad way thoughdirt roadssmall roadsforestsmountainslakescityeverything you want is there for you to explore And exploring is fun There are hidden barns and other collectables While barns are funthey give you a new car but other collectables are just there for the sake ofcollectables But again – not

1,Greatest FM ever Too expensive howeverTLDR 810  WORTH buyingbut NOT a MUST BUYIve basically won every trophy this seasonhowever I did get incredibly lucky in the UCL Semis where I beat City on Aggregate 10 with a total of 3shots over 2 games woops Did some major changes to my squadSOLD PogbaMartialMaguireFred and Costato fund my BUYS J FelixHaalandMarquinhosAouarR Neves and Donnarumma Massive changes to structurebut hope things go well in my 6th season After this seasonim starting a fresh savetrust meIve collected more than 1500hrs in each FM that comes out each yearfrom fm1019 Yea probably need a lifebut gives a nice feelI buy the game in support of the developers for all the years and hours of fun its given me So ive already grown to know what to expect as each year goes by Its the same gameits just refreshedsquads updatedand some small nice additions The development center seems to be a very nice addition to the gamehowever im not deep enough into the game to warrant a full conclusion on how it really performsnothing ground breakingnothing overzealousjust simple and what you need Lookthis year its again a simple facelift plus some The addition of a handful of small new featuresand the big addition of the development centerits good Thats it Expect the game to be as how it always has beenseem to miss too many or hit them directly at the keeper Maybe its just my poor forwardsno cluehave to keep monitoringare really minutematch engine tweaks have been a LITTLE BIT betterbut still far from perfect Still dislike the 1on1 failures and shooting from impossible acute angles But its better than the start of BETAbut nothing that jumps at you as a MUST BUY series Good game as always nonethelessThis is the fastest Im dropping an FM gameand by a MILE 29 hours might not seem like much but for someone who has thousands and thousands of hours combined between previous editions going back to Championship Manager 4it was enoughgiving you control over more things than everwith some littlesometimes unnecessarybut cool touches in the end it delivers on most promises bar onethe crucial aspect  the match engine That one doesnt seem like you can control it AT ALLor the conversion rate of 1on1sand its all trueand for that the team can take full credit Youve lured me in Even with limited time Ive decided to come back to the franchise after two yearsso kudos to the marketing teamresponsibilities instead of keeping it simple got messybut its not a big dealexcept for the game itself The match engine just doesnt cut itand while I dont believe thats the caseit literally feels like it was an afterthought this year To the extent that I wouldnt be surprised if someone told me this engine was created from scratch in like 100 hoursyour team does the same things for the most part regardless of the instructions The game gave me no joyeven when winning I wasnt winning My team wasnt playing the way I wanted The majority of goals scored had nothing to do with the style of play my tactics were usingthinking it would affect the outcomebut even at FMs worst points the game didnt disappoint me to such an extentAI teams always going bankrupt BANKRUPT SIMULATOR 2020 Good gamebut you got to make a discountThe price is too high for a game which released 4 months agoEverything apart from the matches is superbbest FM everso SI nerfed the conversion rates of oneonone chances to keep scorelines acceptable The result howeveris that your world class  striker misses 25 easy chances every gameinstead preferring to shoot from obscenely acute angles rather than play the ball across the boxand yet over 50 of the crowd are dressed in orange It diminishes the match experience and detracts from the game as a wholebroken for 2 months nowIve bought every game in this series since the year 2000I preorder every year literally the only game I will do so with and said Ill continue to do so until I get burned WellSI Gamesyouve broken me at last The Bugs section of your forum is littered with these issues that are under reviewwell you can consider my purchase of FM 2021 in the same categoryyoull thank me for itEvery year we see improvements here and therethis year thats not an exception Although still far from perfectthe 3D engine and graphics were improvedsmall tweaks through out the entire game and interfacemore tactical response from the players in the pitchimproved relationships and the biggest focus for this new edition The youth prospects and the future of your club and carreer Now the clubs objectives are set on a more accurate and demanding way and the young players are really taken into consideration regarding the next few years Its fair tosomehowsay that this new edition is more of the samebut in the end its refreshing and its changes are enough to renew our desire and hunger to keep playing year after year this amazing game I play since the very first edition back in the 90severy year I spend long hours playing I was a teenager by that time and Im a 41 years old married father today I never get fed up of this gameno matter whatI love football manager and I genuinely regret buying this gamedespite two updates and promises that it will be sorted This is a football management game where the strikers cant score one on oneswhich therefore renders all counter attacking football as useless Ive been a huge fan of the series for a decade but this is the worst one Ive ever playedBewareyou might never leave your houseThis game and the games before it converted me into a football fanand I had barely any appreciation of sports before that pointin gaming termslike a grand strategy RPG You have the grand strategy element of heaps and heaps of numbers going up and down and the initial confusion of understanding what any of them meanas well as being able to play for 400 hours like I have and realise you understand absolutely nothing about the gameand still having that creeping feeling that you really dont know what youre doingand you have to balance your match day squad as best as possible Its not just a case of whos best at what although sometimes it can be  you might need to settle a disgruntled playeror give one of your younger players a chance to shine and get some experience in the first teamcringing when your team has an awful defeat and cheering when they do well Were you responsible Was it just RNG Who knowsbut its funisnt it Trying to work out whats actually you and what is just smoke and mirrors is part of the funeven if youre not a fan of football and sportif you have an interest in grand strategy or complex RPGs you may just appreciate the incredibly diverse and immersive game that has the potential to grab you here For meplayers like Alessandro RossiHendrick Weydandt and Luismi are burned into my brainand Ive gotten a brand new appreciation for the complexity and nuance that the sport of football has This IS the beautiful gamebut not as you know itEach edition of FM stands or falls with its match engineand 2020 is unfortunately one of the poorest entries in that regard The problems in the vanilla version have already been covered in many reviewsand hoping that the most recent update had improved thingsI gave it another spin The outcomes are no longer quite as absurd as they used to bebut still miles from acceptable Worldclass forwards waste chance after chancegoalkeepers win pretty much every oneononeand most goals come from standards There are some interesting UI updates and streamlining of various sections that are an improvement over earlier editionsbut the constant match day frustration makes this one an inferior entry over its last few predecessorsPLEASE put a discount on for this time of need I LOVE Football Manager but with issues with money because of COVID19its extremely expensiveI think theres a lot more to come from you and I completely believe youve got what it takesFotball manager is always solid fun Developing a club is such a rewarding thing I do wish that they would not release a new game every year More development would benefit the gaming experience A rooster update every year would satisfy more playersUnderstandablyas someone who has clocked up roughly 8500 hours playing the FM series thus far from CM0001 to the current iterationId like to think I know what makes a good Football Manager game and what has historically let the series down FM20 does the best job of any instalment so far of improving and expanding on the good and dealing with the negativesCruyff turnsstopandgoall represented here in the best match engine to date Yes the crowd animations are repetitive but you know whatif you want to play FIFAgo and play FIFAfriendworry not Along with all these new options comes a wealth of new staff responsibilitiesand you can delegate or take charge at your leisureLike to finalise signings but dont really care about the scouting side of things Delegate it Prefer to find those hidden gems yourself but couldnt care less about negotiating their contracts Suredelegate it Want to keep an eye on your blossoming U23 side but the U18s are just too far off your radar right now Guess what Delegate iteverything you can think of that would improve the series from FM19 is here Data presentation is fantasticplayer development and progression is as close to perfection as it could be FM20 makes the complicated things seem simple and makes the simple things seem effortless To methis is now THE Football Manager titleFM20 is a defining moment in the history of Football Manager titles Make no mistakethis one is a classic Though you may not find the next Tonton Zola Mokouko sitting in Derby Countys reservesevery story you do write for yourself on this genredefining game will carry its own memories and legacy and surely that is the highest praise of allGame is good but the price is ridiculous for a glorified patch with 1 or 2 extra featuresWas free on EPIC last weekLast night I calculated my Football Manager playtime since I first purchased FM2013 It was 5929 hours So now I finally feel qualified to review itHere is what Ill say about if you should purchase this or notits too expensive
1,Thought Id submit this for the benefit of the devsbut would prefer normal campaigningit just all fits in nicely and melds together very welland very rewarding on those clutch momentsand understandeverything is much easiersometimes really long snaking corridorsother time very close dungeons with multiple doors to choose from but you need to go all the directions anywaydue to the multiple clicks required to do a simple actionie move 3 out of 4 hexesand poisonthe walls can make everything feel really claustrophopicI suggest making each tile slightly biggerso there is more room on the map It all feels super crammed in tightand I have to spend a card unlock on them Theyre essential cards to some classes imoand should not be put in with the level unlocksright nowsometimes it is difficult to determine when you draw that x etc Maybe separate those numbers from the enemy hp baror I just never come across themyou get no XPgold etc Please fix this you get both xp and gold in the boardgameand the tavernwhy not just put it all in one placeor self effect items can be a bit clunkymaybe once youve chosen your two cardsyou could lock them inand choose initiative thenarent thereand nothing to spend it on because other minor settlements have no items to buyI have failed a few scenarios thinking there were no other roomsto suddenly see a door and know I have failed due to me thinking there were fewer roomsbut  that means lots of room for growth Do not regret spending £0I own the board game version I play the Tabletop Simulator official version every weekover 60 sessions and countingand I play this video game versionand I strongly recommend them allbut its seriously one of the best board games ever madeand they have great scripts for most aspects of your turn Its an amazing way to experience Gloomhavenin my opinionthe best way to experience the game solo Gloomhaven can be played solo 1 character or multiple in both other versionsbut none of them do it as well as this game I actually think that once this video game is completeit will surpass both other versions in quality of life and ease to play Whether or not playing a video game online can surpass a board game IRL with friendsfor you personally is another story For me I like online gamingand have a great community of friends to play withso I could really see this game being better than Tabletop Simulators DLC in the long runbecause it just runs so wellanother 10 taking it down Youll spend 50 of your time playing the gameand another 30 of it rifling through the rulebook This is pretty common for new playersand even some veterans need clarifications almost every session especially when unlocking new cardsclasses The video game takes SO much of the vagueness out of the gamebecause the game knows the answer to the question youre not able to ask it An example that came up a lot when my group started playing Push and Pull It took us awhile to figure out exactly where we could push or pulland we thought incorrectly that the mechanic was very restrictive and weakand being able to visually see valid hexes to pullpush enemies intowe realized just how strong the mechanics can be in certain situationsI think this is the best format to start on The price tag may be a turnoffbut I assure youthe value is there I meanI own the board gameIve played over 60 sessions on TTSand yet I still put over 160 hours into this video gameand it was the latest of the 3 versions I playedand youre like me You finish a session and youre still itching to play This game will scratch that itch It gives you a chance to try the classes youve only sat across the table from Try new card combos and items or enhancements The Guildmaster mode which is basically the main game right nowlets you quickly jump into a scenario and playall the campaignand starts into the Expansions I cant get enough Gloomhaven TBHand this game just gives me one more way to play it If youre a GH Junkie like meyou need this game Buy itBought this because I had no one to play the board game with irlnow I can play by myself and have fun Thanks GloomhavenI think this may be my first review in all of my years on Steamwe are now about 4 months into the Early Access version of this game and I wanted to really highlight the development teams handling of itsubstantial changes to the core elements of their Adventure mode variant of this board game adaption alreadyconsistent additions towards that eventual goalmy confidence in the team that will be able to eventually deliver that faithful port of the physical board game has grown tremendously since they seem to be completely on track with their road map thus far They even amended their road map through this process to include shifts in priorities based on community feedbackwhile I have no station to guarantee it will happenI feel quite confident that they will be able to follow through on their promise to create a truedigital adaptation of Gloomahven In the meantimethe adventure mode that is constantly evolving several times per month is already worth the modest asking price as Ive already put over 100 hours into the gameincluding almost all of the playable characters and over 100 scenariosThe game is still in early accessso features from the board game are being added slowly currently theres only five heroesand the full campaign from the board game hasnt been added you have a randomlygenerated mode instead  Even the existing heroes dont yet have all their skills  Additionallythe devs have been forthright with the fact that adding the full game and all the classes will take some time  If you want to play with ieverythingi you may want to waitif youre fine with early access limitationsthis is a very good game  The developers are responsive and have tweaked it in response to user feedback right noweven with all its limitationsthe randomlygenerated mode is quite funTwo words Early Accessand you can play solo through as many scenarios as you like If you enjoy turnbyturn tactical puzzles then this is pretty funat least at firstand there is no larger campaign No story No larger goal Pretty quickly it gets to feel like been there and done that Ive maxed out three of the character classes and learned a lot about how to play the game Ill probably try the other character classes But after that Ill probably set it aside until the full version of the game is finishedyou probably want to waith1IN A WORD bCOMPELLINGbh1turnbased tactical combat and compact dungeoncrawling With abstracted elements providing adventuring servicesand minor character and party management Set in a dark fantasy world with a nomadic aesthetic Where players take a group of up to four mercenaries on a series quests to defeat a myriad of enemies and levelup their characters while hunting for treasurebut with a number of subtle differences The GM mode plays more like a sandbox with generic quests when compared to the campaign Which consists of up to 95x unique storylinked scenarios in the guise of core and sidequeststo overcome Perhaps the biggest difference between modes is that in the campaign characters take on take on a personal quest that when achievedforces the mercenary to retire and a new one called in their placecustomisation and the inevitable trainers Cooperative online sessions for between two and four playersrequire an invitation code be sent to participantsgiving gamers the possibility of taking on the role of gamemaster andor the mercenariesattack modesstrengths and weaknesses Plus 7x bosses to defeatthat plays somewhat like a sandboxForest  Dungeon that can become overfamiliar with extended playsettings and visuals it certainly proved enchanting to take a look at The deeplayeredcomplexity generated by copious mechanics make this a dream for fans of tactical board type games Though it should be noted that on standard and higher difficulties the campaign possesses a seemingly strong level of predetermination and a puzzle like quality to its gameplaythis would have been UNMISSABLE As it is casual gamers be wary the Guildmaster mode will be enjoyablethe Campaign mode not so muchgo offSteam toI already love this game  Its been available for just over an hourbut I eagerly installed it  I played through my first scenario with a Brute and Scoundrel  Its great  Its super faithful to the board gameand I really wish I didnt have to go to work right nowbut it would just be nice to have that extra confirmation of what my attack did in a text logand Im sure there will be improvements here and there  ButI am really amazed that I played through the first scenario without seeing anything incorrect  AndI definitely used the cards to full advantage pushed and pulled into traps  Maximized my looting  Really great job  Best Day 1 early access experience in a whileA few hours in so far My thoughts are generally positivebut it definitely feels very early access at this point Disregarding the fact that the main modes multiplayer and campaign are not yet accessibleIm only critiquing what is currently playablewhich is a sorta randomized adventure campaign that you can play solo with  charactersso you need to know how all that stuff works already There is a workinprogress Youtube tutorial videobut you would never be able to play the game after watching that you need help info during combat to explain what is happening To be clear Im not really knocking the game for thisits kinda expected for early access This is more just a warning to anyone thinking of trying this out if you havent played the board gamewhen a round startsyou dont see the modifier cards that the enemies pull unless you mouseover each enemy to see what theyre going to do that round This is very unlike the board game where you individually pull each card to see what the enemy does that turn Another problem is that the attack modifiers that you pull on each attack are super understatedand it took me a while to even notice where it was showing this its tiny tiny text over the enemys health bar that appears for like 1 second and then disappears This needs to be like a big overlay center screen that says 1 or Xso its really clear what is happening on each attack I constantly have things happen and Im like waitwhat happened there why did he not die did he negate that or something It doesnt help that there is no battle log so you cant just look back at the last move to get the summarythen at other points to specify the attackthen at other points to specify the push directionetc it can be confusing to figure out what the game is asking you to specify at any one momentand it can be real finicky about accepting what youre telling it and moving onto the next step In some cases Ive had it actually get stuck at a certain step and refuse to let me back out of that like I had a movement action where I selected that movement just to see what my options wereand it locked in the movement and wouldnt let me undo or back out of the action the only option I had was to confirm the movement which I didnt want to do and it forced me to walk into a trap But in general during these steps it really needs some text or visual indication of exactly what action youre doing right now so you dont have to just intuit what the game is trying to get you to dowhich can be a problem when youre trying to make a decision and there is UI covering the characters like when you need to decide if youre going to take the damage or lose a card instead its important to know how much health the character has for this decisionbut in a lot of cases you cant see their health because that specific choice UI covers itthey are just a background with nothing to do there I feel like Im missing somethingIm still having a lot of fun with it because Gloomhaven is just plain fun and the original game mechanics are pretty much there Looking forward to all the improvementsIve played the board game and all of its expansions extensively andin my humble opinionGloomhaven is the absolute pinnacle of strategic turn based card combat in any game ever The digital version is fantastic at not only recreating the game in virtual spacebut also creating new fun ways of playing the game I would highly recommend any fan of board games or dungeon crawlers get this game or the real board game and its expansions for that matterThis is an amazing digital recreation of my favorite board game of all time As of writing thisthe full campaign has not yet been releasedbut the Guildmaster mode alone is worth the price of entryits a turn basedcoopRPGstrategy game in which players choose from their deck of cards to guide their character through a series of dungeon crawls  There are a variety of enemieseach with different abilitiesrequiring different strategies to overcome  The rules are lowtomedium complexityand this digital version takes much of the more complex work the rules dictating the AI out of your hands  There is character progression via gearHPnew cardsand card modificationdo yourself a favor and pick up this digital version  It is fairly faithful to the physical board gameand removes much of the busy work eg no setupno AI to manage  The graphics do a great job of bringing the board game to lifeand the game is beautiful without requiring high end hardware  I believe these games are always best played with friendsbut I have spent many hours enjoying playing this version solo  something I couldnt do with the physical board gamebut even cranked all the way upoutside of missions where new enemies constantly spawnan adept player will almost never fail a mission  There are mods available to increase difficultybut as of this writingsuch mods are not functional in multiplayer gamesGood attempt at the actual board game My only issue really is that there is no well implemented undo button for botched turn picks All they need is to have the undo option let you rechoose card orderempowering thingsusing itemsetc If you miss a steptheres no going backwhich ruins a whole dungeon sometimes Ive lost many times when I really shouldnt have from a faulty click with no option to go backeven though the execution hasnt even been finalized Still recommendedbut that UNDO button is badly neededas other reviewers will also tell youIve never played the Gloomhaven Boardgame so i did a deep divenot really preparedit will take more than  hours to go thru with itkeep that in mind if you want a chance to refund it Maybe watch a video on YT first before palying digital Gloomhaven at allat least at the start until you knowwhat you do After that you can play a quick adventure here and there and build your guild   toons upGloomhaven is still in Early Access  Its very playablethoughwith a lot of content  The latest update introduced a new sort of story mode they call Guildmaster  You basically run a guild of dudesand go exploring for dangertreasurefameand gloryand I know manymany others agreeGloomhaven is one of the best board games ever made  And this digital version is EXACTLY the board game converted to PCand the interface is smooth as silk  One of the best board game interfaces Ive played on PCbut they just introduced a brand newcomprehensive interactive tutorial that really helps out immensely  There is also a How to Play rulebook ingame that you can access at ANY TIMEeven in the middle of a fight  Which is nicebut they promise the FULL campaign from the original board game  This will be an outstanding and immense campaignwith 80 unique and hand created missionsgear to find and equipbonuses to discoveretc  The game is a blast to play if you like fantasy board games  It really is a wonderful digital adaptation and it nails the board game rules without deviationnothing to complain about here  The characters and monsters are really detailed and look greathighly recommended even now in early access  The new Guildmaster update really adds a ton of contentand its almost like a full campaign in its own rightbut they still give it two very dark sunglasses up  The band they got back together really enjoys it tooIf youre a fan of the board gameyou should get this game  All of the funnone of the set up time  Scenarios take 100 minutes instead of 1 hours  No more arguing over line of sight or monster focusmove mechanics  The AI takes care of all that for you  The multiplayer mode is fantastic and the introduction of Guildmaster is a welcome improvement from the freeplay adventure modethe game is still in Early Accessso there are a handful of bugs  Nothing too major  My friends and I had to restart the game a handful of times when the game bugged outbut luckily it autosaves at the beginning of every roundso theres no need to restart the scenariothe Steam game is a good place to start to learn the rules and mechanics  It will save you a lot of time reading the rulebookonline FAQsand googling ambiguous situationsIt is only appropriate that one of the most ludicrously ambitious board games ever should get one of the most ambitious ports ever It is far better than Id have dared hope for  combining faithful translation of the board gameexcellent UXand decadent 3d graphics The departures from the board game are all good choices resolving AI ties with randomness instead of player choicereplacing a couple abilities that would have made the interface much worseetc In additionit is both wonderful and kind of insane that they added an entirely new semirandom campaign mode Guildmasterthat is arguably better than the originals campaignbut since they have provided modding supportits not too big a problemwowgreat job Flaming FowlUpdated 11100 for the City Streets release Ill abbreviate my updates for this release with CSbut resetting and playing with other people is extremely difficult and largely impracticalI was stokedespecially since most of my gaming group moved over the past few monthsso goodI have to say While this isnt the campaign experience from the board game at this time  thats coming later  whats here so far is solid I appreciate the developers making sure each new mercenary they release is done rightthis is early accessso features are light right now and bugs are aplenty Heres what youll get as of this writingmoneyenhancementsand perk pointsnot every missionbut is easily resumablethoughthere are strikea lotstrike of bugswhich is par for the course with early access Heres what my friend and I have seen playing together co opbut does still occur Typically what happens is my online session as host terminates suddenly and my friend is kickedforcing him to quit and rejoin my sessionstrike CS These seem fixedallowing them to be used a second time yaystrike CS These seem fixedtooso they are always used immediately when the encounter starts but do refresh properly on long rest CS Still seems to be the caseand I am wondering if this is a design decision at this point rather than a bugbut gameplay can be slow and itd be nice to have a x speed option especially for solo playno matter how long its been since the prior clickso its very easy to accidentally start an attack without hitting all available targets There is no confirmation for skipping targets like there is for skipping whole card effectsbut for standard movement this should absolutely be an option Finding out you hit the wrong hex and youre out of range for something when you could have been elsewhere suckstheres no undo action for card effects that will not actually affect anything until future actions For instanceif I apply a buff to myselfthen change my mind and want to moveI should be able to do that  the buff doesnt matter until Ive done anything elseafter allwhich is bad and confusing During setupcards are deselected by left clicking them again During the roundcard actions are deselected with a right click Enemies are deselected with a right click as well Given the above noteaccidentally left clicking an enemy a second time to undo will launch your attackso hopefully you were done picking targets Dwhich is something I hadnt specifically noted in this review but was a very pleasant surpriseheres my  centsyou should absolutely buy it nowyou wont find it yet and should waitwatch some streams This is fun and Id probably like it anywaybut your mileage will definitely varybut my core evaluation remains the same Great updatethoughwith lots of new content and a lot of minor improvementsThis is an extremely faithful adaptation of the tabletop game for those who arent awareGloomhaven has been the 1 board game on BoardGameGeek for about 3 years now As of June 4 01the game is only missing the board games campaignwhich would be a bummer if it werent for Guildmaster modewhich acts as a sandbox campaign with a whole ton of content and the entirety of the games roster of mercenaries for you to play with and experimentgiven that the game is in Early AccessId say it is in a very good place Wholeheartedly recommended to anyone looking for a great tactical skirmish experience It cannot be overstated just how good the turn to turn gameplay istheres now a x3 speed up button and the campaign is in betaThis is a great automated version of Gloomhavenentirely faithful to the original though campaign isas of early accessnot complete yet If you enjoy strategic boardgamesthis is an easy purchase If you enjoy Gloomhaven specificallythis might be a Must Buyeven though we are in early accessthis game is fun as hell Devs appear to be good communicatorstheyve got a roadmap for the evolving nature of the productand have got something pretty damn good builtSo let me start this review by saying that yesI do own the board game I have a 178 hours into Gloomhavenmost of which I accumulated during Early Access playing the Guild Master mode I am currently playing the campaign modeand I have done the bulk of those hoursoutside tutorialsin multiplayerfor me the challenge is my gaming group is almost always 5 people which is one too many For referenceI do play a lot of board game digitallyThrough the AgesCarcassone and Ticket to Rideto name a few I also love ZombicdeHero Quest got the new edition this weekVindication and 7 wonders to name a few physical gamesbut the person can rejoin the game at the start of the next roundwhen you pick your cards It would be better if they could join while a round is in progressbut the disconnects are not frequentalthough I would have no issue added a third and either do 3 or one person gets twonot readily throw your turn away because the card system is both your lifeyour time limit and your abilities This can make for some surprising interaction and decisions and sometimes luck and some pretty hilarious accusations when your partner does something really dumb or brilliantmost people will find one more classes that suit their playing style Its great fun to play in Guild Master mode or the Campaign You unlock characters in both They just play so differently though that its great and rarely feels stale even if youve been playing for a while and are moving onto a new onewell you can learn Some of the classes are complicated and not easy to really get the hang ofbut you really dont have to focus on the characters you really hate playing if you dont want to If there is more than one of youwell your partners might love what you hate anywaysome explorationa lite story now and then and chance encounters Its a coop board game that allows everyone to play the game and not try go be some game master or something that separates you from the other You can also do something meaningful in an hour to hour and a half I mean this isnt Divinity or Neverwinter Nights or a full fledged RPG experiencebut it is a great digital version of a board game many people love or love to hateunique decks for each classinteresting mapslots of monsters that behave differentlythe maps with traps and obstacles can change your strategythe campaign has bosses with unique decks and challenges even decisions to be made Its a lot of stuff without the  hour affair of separating componentswell this is nice way to jump right in each nightgive it a try You never knowyou might just really enjoy it enough to play night after night and still feel the thrill of trying another roundseeing another encounter or trying to remember what the heck those plant looking people are called
0,As a person with a disability of not having use of my hands to play regular games I have found a passion in clicker and idle gameswith that saidthis is the best clicker game I have ever played and it is still in early access It has already beaten the competition and has great potential for so much more Thank you for the hours of entertainment I shall find myself lost in000 hours  This had the potential to be a great game  But three years inits become more cashgrab than anything else  Want the best gear  Paywall  Spent actual cashmoney on a character  Said character gets nerfed to oblivion  Thats why its important that they have that Early Access tag on the game  So they can make good characterscollect the money from playersand then nerf it to the point that nobody will use it in their formation  Now theyve put event characters behind a paywall toobecause you wont have enough currency in the form of Time Gate Pieces  Prior to this changeyou could pick up all the previously released characters in a particular event by simply running each variant once  Nowyou have to pay Time Gate Pieces  Itll cost you 1event to pick up the characters you missedescalating by 6 per year  You know how ELSE you can get previously released characters  Whyyesyou guessed it  PAYWALL  Fork over that cashmoneysuckaCrusaders of the Lost Idolsthe devs gave characters 3 item slots  Here they have 6with the standard CommonUncommonRare  Epic varieties  BUT WAIT  What if you havent had much luck opening the chests you earned for free by playing an event  PAYWALL  Alsowith the addition of Golden Epicsyou have ANOTHER opportunity to give them money  A Golden Epic is TWICE as effective as a normal epic  GET THAT WALLET OUTthere is a Golden Epic released EVERY weekendwith an additional one released for each new character every two to three weeks  If you want to keep upthats a minimum of five bucksweek  the new character one  Youll need to spend between five and ten bucks depending on the week  But then youll have a Golden Epic and a bunch of Uncommons or Rares on the character  So youd better spend MORE than the minimum of 5 to get that GE  Probably better to spend ten or twenty so you get some SHINIESwhich are 50 more effective than the normal item rarityso that every 10 of a SINGLE kind of chest you open will have an Epic in it   But ten bucks will get you 7 chests plus the three you get for free from running a characters event missionsso you could be unlucky read normal luck and have only the GE you bought and one epic from the missionsplus one shiny on a random slot for that character  The 10 option has the Most Popular with an explosion graphic so youre tempted to spend that MONEY  But the Best Value is 4 chests for 50 bucks  So if you want to actually gear up a characterGET THAT WALLET OUTthe better you do  Dont spendyoull be consigned to the bottom end of the power curve  If you like giving your money to blatant cashgrabsI recommend playing the lottery  Skip this onethe QA process is broken at best and nonexistant at worst  Events and new content regularly come out with gamebreaking flaws  Sometimes theyre fixed quicklysometimes not  Depends on whether they affect their cashflow from their playersif you do have a problemthe customer service is wildly erratic  Sometimes theyll get back to you quickly and solve your problemsometimes they wont respond at all  Sometimes theyll sayeffectivelyNeener Neener and mark your ticket as resolved after a year  QUALITY customer service Sarcasm detectedbut I just cant take it anymore  Im doneIn response to the review pointing out that most of the negative reviews have 50 hours of playtimeheres a guy with over 5k hours telling you to find a better idle game to playand they will sell literally everything possible in the game to get it chestschampionstime gate piecespotionsscrollscardsfamiliars I wouldnt be surprised if they start selling campaigns in the future Dont get me wrongit is entirely possible to play the game without buying a single thing like mebut youll find that you are not the type of player they will cater for and youll be consistently just behind the peak of progression because of itso Id be remiss not to point out some others that Ive enjoyedits the company thats adding them you need to look atnot the playersThis is definitely not for everyoneif youre a new parent looking for something to do with a baby in your other armcatharticidle game that you can sit down at for a few minutes then walk away from No massive pressure login every 15 minutes You can still make progress just poking at it whenever you have a chance to sit for a few minutesand this definitely fits that overworkedbutneedsomethingtoclick demographicbut Im sure there are plenty of Steam users out there who understandIts one of those games where youve put some time into it only to ask yourselfWhy am I even playing thisthen by all meansbut dont expect to get any real joy from thisIf you haven’t played Crusaders of the Lost Idolsget prepared for the deepest clicker everand if you enjoy idle gamesyou ought to give Idle Champions a shotI have a lovehate relationship with this game   You can be successful just grinding away endlessly but to be successful in ones lifetime you really need to pay to play  That bothers methough I have paid to playso maybe thats why  It is extremely addictiveand while I cannot say the time spent is dedicated mostly checking in every 3060 minutes to see how things areI also cannot say it is fun  Its just there  Always Running in the backgroundand the content added sometimes brings nostalgia for past games like Neverwinter Nightsor DD obviouslyor some of the recent Twitch stream DD characters playedI am still grinding away much more than a thousand hours later as of this writingthen this is recommended  If you are not into grindy or hate PW schemes then avoid this at all costs  As such I am going to give it a slightly thumbs up 501 since there is no maybe button  YMMVOne of the most complex idlers Ive seen to date A little too complex to be honest Its greatbut it is very longthere is a lot of strategy involvedand to me the strategy doesnt seem well thought outit is just the byproduct of throwing many random mechanics in the game each update Its power creep at its finest yet there are no safety guardsthey just let it grow more and more out of control each timeyou cant choose who you want to attackor what abilities your champions useand you cant see health bars if enemies are stacked on top of eachother which they will beby the dozens you cant remove buffs that arent helpful Firebreath potion Yetthere is such a big focus on these mechanics that if you dont do themyou simply wont progressId say its downright impossible to find the best combinations on your own and to keep up with all the moving parts You absolutely need to search for external guidesopinionscharts and spreadsheets if you want to progress steadily The game is very involvedbut at the same time it feels like you cant do enough if you prefer an active playstyle Meanwhileits called Idle Championsyet sometimes it doesnt feel like an idle game at all because of the complex strategies needed to make any progress If you were to let the game run for a full yearyou would make very little progress because each adventure is isolated and selfcontainedgear you buy could become completely irrelevant once you unlock a better champion They sell chests in packages of 5 to 50 USD This is PER champion and there are 60 champions in the game Imagine trying to gear all of them via ingame purchases Yesyou can play this game completely FP and I suggest you try to but just the fact that they give you the option to spend thousands of dollars to gain only a bit of an upper edge is absolutely appalling Its one of the biggest traps and I expected a lot better from the devs given how wholesome and accommodating the community isI give the game a thumbs up because I still enjoy itand I do recommend it if youre into idlerssince theres nothing really like it Its just a little ridiculous when you step back and look at exactly what is going on If you do try itbe sure to read some guides if you get stuckand be VERY careful of the ingame cash shopNeverending grind even if you are paying Paying just puts you farther ahead on the same grind Not even in the ballpark for DD lore either The lore of DD is what made me want to try itespecially since its supposed to be set in The Forgotten Realms There is no loreor almost none and what there is isnt very deep or engaging in any way Drizzt stats alone should get someone fired Their answer They plan to nerf all of the good well used characters and give slight buffs to all of the worthless ones like Drizzt in hopes that people will play the bad ones more Heard of socialism in DD Make them all more equallaughable The truth is that by nerfing the good and buffing some of the never used they hope to have a giant cash grab while players have to get better equipment on the garbage ones by buying chest deals that give a gold item or a set number of shiny items I doubt these devs have ever even played pnp DD and they most likely get the new ideas from cash grab gurus who have also never played DD What about having to choose between the characters Want to bring the monk and the rogue pickpocket in the same group Too bad so sad There are quests that only allow certain characters based on statsalignmentetcIm not talking about that Every time a new guy gets pooped out of their cash grab officesit gets added to a slot occupied by other characters so you can only choose one from that slot at any given time What exactly would be the trouble in making all of the characters available for quests that they qualify for If you wanted Minsc and CattiBrie in a group then you should be able to have themalong with any other combo a player wants Considering what a shallow obvious pw cash grab this game is the least they could do is let you play who you wanton quests that allow the character anyway I have to keep throwing in that fine print for the fanboys that will totally miss the point I was trying to make Lastly the rate that they churn out eventsnew characterspetsnew quests requiring certain group combos with gear levels youll only get by spending loads of cash on chestsetc means you never get off the hamster wheel if you want to be on top Hamster wheelhey the event ended  days agoheres another event with character 386 that youll need to buy this golden item chest combo forwho cares that hes the 18th bard weve releasedslight exaggeration but not exaggerating the time frame of events and releases of new products There are many fanboys who will defend anything that the devs do or say but with 3000 hours and playing DD since the early 80s I think Im entitled to my opinion Do yourself a favor and play real games instead of idler cash grabs Anyone that says they have 100 completion on this without spending loads of cash is flat out lying  thumbs downif I had more thumbs theyd be down tooThis game does what it advertisesand well  It gives you all the correct dopamine injections to let your lizard brain thriveh1All of the negatives of their other titlewith very few of the positivesh1this is an idlerso dont expect clutch gameplay or anything like thatmay I suggest their other title  Crusadors of the Lost IdolsOP championswhich has always been a strong point of CNEthe negativesbif you have a slow internetlive far away from the serversyou will have severe loading issues champions dont appear on screenskills arent shownenemies are invisible that will potentially break your gameif you arent actively trying to get the new championsyou will fall behind It also exacerbates the above reloading issuesa very forgettable idler  if I wasnt going for the 100 in achievementsI would have avoided entirelyh1I have more than 1000 hours in this game I still dont recommend it  as I mentioned aboveI am going for the 100 completionclosing this one seems to yield significantly less gold than if I left it open  hopefully this will change in future patchesthe reload time is awfuldue to the lack of local caching  another reason to keep it runningthan you do and hit a wall after 100s of hoursThis is my newest reason for not getting ANY work done You can set it up and leave it hence the idle part and just return for an adjustment every now and thenbut invariably I find myself spending the same amount of time watch the incremental progression of my championsas I did in the old days of yore watching my hard drive defragmentingHeres the rub This is a good game As clickeridle games go The company is activemore the most part fixes things fastreleases lots of new content Its a great idle clicker game One of the bestachievement hunters and whales They release streams of new skinsfeatsgolden epics and new characters  But I guess thats the name of the beast Though they are ratcheting up the microtransactions more More packssurprise special time only offersmore skinsdifferent play modes that need extra play time or moneyhave a whole bunch of extra money or have an iron will to not be temptedavoid this game Your wallet will thank you But if none of that is an issueits a damn god game I dumped 13000 hours into it before finally seeing what it was becomingWithout a doubt the most disgustingly monitized clicker game ever Chock full of loot boxes and overpriced consumables with exceptionally low durationsadvertisements for Starter Packs Charactersitemsand boosts only available for real moneyexcessive ingame item advertisingoverpriced lootboxesReal Money Consumablesand intentionally tedious game design make this a very solid NOTrust meA fair bit of enjoyment for little effort  Definitely worth the cost of admissionbut the amount they ask for things all but guarantees I will never buy anything from this gameIf I play on an ipad and steam I have to buy the same things over and over It should be possible to link the accounts so that I can use the same purchases on both systems   It would be nice to have the option to buy for all accountsIts a single player game with extremely predatory monetization  Loot boxes will be crammed down your throat every 5 minutes  Also kind of addictivebut I guess thats the whole point  Give this a passGo look at the DLC menuthen come back and tell me this isnt maliciousTLDR psychological free to play garbage in a DD skin Play something else insteadThe only satisfaction Ive derived is psychological tricks which are all too familiar in gaming nowadays Theres goals to progresscurrencies to accrue but its all so hollow because its all designed to 1 keep you playing and  funnel you into using the storeit costs gold the most basic currencythe one you earn the most of by playing the game to unlock the characters in your roster to be placed in the party and it costs gold to level them up And every subsequent character and level costs more And yes the game is designed so you are encouraged to grindespecially if you really want to access that level up advantage for that one character or unlock that character further on in the roster And wryly amusing this is the only DD game Ive played where character levels are meaningless Because theyre bought with gold appropriate for a game such as thiscalled favour It basically something you only seem to accrueand the more you have the more quickly youll gain gold when adventuring in that areathencan be unlocked in a different screen Of course for money you can get a lot morebetter chests Chests can contain various consumables which increase stats like character power or gold earned and they can also contain gear for the characters in the game including those you dont have as well as items which upgrade an item for one of the characters but only if you have a character with an item in all slotsit gets complicated except not really because its all a roundabout way to keep you playing and want more and spend money This being a DD gametheres special characters or character skins that may be desirable if you watch certain streams and theres events with special currencies an characters which can be earned by playing as well as codes which can be used in locked chests to get different types of chests
1,Really good RTS gamethe campaign is excellent set during WW2 on the eastern fronttrying to overcome the power of the nazi war machine and struggle with the harsh winters of Russia With the added bonus of extra single player missions for dlc Recommend to anyone that enjoys world war games or RTS games in generalhundreds of achievements and hours of fundeath and devastation The multiplayer section of the game is addictiveallowing you to pit your wits against other players or CPU in 1v1 or v battles win or lose you will earn in game currency to purchase better doctrinesDLCskins etca really great game to have and play That been said there are a few flaws with the gamea couple of the achievements are no longer able to be unlocked since the game has change so much since its release and it doesnt look like they will fix this any time soon and compared to the original CoH this fails to meet expectations However the game is still excellent and well worth your money and your timeIts a good gamenot everyone around the world can speak Mandarinyou will gain more than what you expectedwe will not say that you have to learn other languages to understand this gameand tell them to get a copied somewhere elsebut also for you to make this game popular in chinese players也是为了英雄连这个系列能在中国玩家里找到自己的地位Okayenough training in skirmish maps Now lets try the campaign for once ❤ Audience This is a game my late brother loved more than all others Hed play this game religiously My favorite memory of him playing this game would be when hed use the command console to speed the game up 1000x or close to that and play entire 1v7 matches in a matter of minutes on the hardest difficulty I would enjoy playing against the computer with him This game has a fantastic multiplayer mode and just being able to cooperate while playing spoiled me too much I will always look back on my time with this game fondly I hope anyone else out there can find just a positive experience with this Have a great dayWhat can I say that 3000 hours doesnt say for me  Its a great RTSprobably my favorite game Ive ever played which is saying something since Im well into my 50s and have played 10s of thousands of hours of games both video and otherwiseit reached this stage at the end of its product cycle instead of the beginning which is a tragedy quite franklybut if not CoH2 is one of those games capable of giving a player thousands of hours of gameplay without ever feeling like youve seen it alldone it all  If you have any interest whatsoever in WWII or RTS gamesthis is an automatic buy  Thanks for spending the time to read my reviewUpdate March 29 2018but most of my original criticism still holds It seems the dev team is now focusing on making COH2 a competitive RTS Little real improvement has however been realized The ingredients for a competitive RTS are completely lackingbalance is a total joke Since launch in 2013 their have been numerous patches concerning unit and faction balance Each and every patch has only made the situation worse For example till January 2018 axis super tanks were exceptionally powerfulespecially in vs Up to the point that  US players would simply not been able to win a fair vs game against equally skilled players other than having to buy that 1 OP commander So now Relic nerfs axis late game tanksup the point where the allied tankscosting less resourcesoutperform their German counterparts Now the allied forces hold a complete advantage over axis in late game in a vs situation These changes are just not thought trough properly This is just one example of numerous destructive balance changes that have been made I think this game cannot be truly balanced anymore Too many factionsunitscommanders and new mechanics were added over the years Compare the old commanders to the shit the new ones get Its not possible to create a balanced RTS in what feels like a fanmade modthe new maps feel atrocious to playespecially in 1vs1 You are constantly running around trying not to loose that one control point that connects to all your other control points So if you loose that pointyou dont get any resources In the old game natural choke points would eventual erupt from the course of the game Now it feels so tiring to constantly have your supply line disrupted by that one fucking point covered in mines and MGs Also giving factions with early access to suppression a clear advantage You just hold that one point throughout the entire early game Effectively denying your opponent all resources in the most important phase Again why do you implement this Poorpoorpoor design choicesit just isnt a serious or competetive RTS anymore If it was to begin with anywayan overpriced in game store with microtransactions and a slow transition into a free2play game This could be related to the 2013 takeover by SEGA and an imposed microtransactions model I wouldnt have granted them a single cent if I knew what they would end up trying to do Free2play is coming soon Every update is clear step in the free2play direction In a final assault they want to get everyone to buy the game before they actually make it f2p Like with almost every gamefree2play will demolish of what is left of a once great game If you really want to playjust wait for the free2playits really that fucking bad During the 2015 christmas salecertain items were 75 off Greatis what you might think However these fuckers are so FUCKING greedy that they actually raised the price of certain commanders to 9 euros instead of the normal 23 so that they could pretend giving a 75 discountwhile selling it for the orginal price no we wont add pay2win commandersbut we actually are adding pay2win commandersa 0 euro single player campain that didnt add any MPcontent and wasnt even worth half of the orginial pricea weird random drop system that they just used to justify their pay2win modelbecause now you can get it by drop so it doesnt matter were asking outrages prices for content in our store The chance that something drops you actually need or want is nihil and the only thing that really drops are crappy bulletinsI have always defended this game because it was enjoyable and it was a good RTS In the end the game is still finebut the way Relic and Sega want to make money of its player base is not They have crossed the line  In recent patches they have made it clear that they only sees players as a cow to be milked before they send you off to the slaughter in the free2play fuckfest they are planningcomradwait for free2play If you really want to play it well the only thing I can say is get it on sale It would be worth the moneybut be aware of what your getting yourself into and the direction that Relic and Sega are taking this gamebut I think those with deeper historical knowledge and understanding will find it unsatisfying and childish The campaign of COH2 was thus not compelling and imo did not paint a complete and historical accurate picture of the Eastern frontIf you are running in to the issue where you cant obtain a free copy of the game because you already have DLCgo to the store page app23130CompanyofHeroes2 in your browser not Steam itselflog in to your Steam accountpress F12 and go to the Console tab of the window that pops uppastetype  AddFreeLicense32859and hit enterNot as good as the first imo but still playable and Epstein didnt kill himselfAnyone who is having issues with the game being locked on the free forever weekendIts a bug and relic is working on fixing itbThis strategy is in Real Timewhich proved to me that strategies can be not only excitinginterestingbut also beautifully realisticbwho with courage are ready to die for the sake of seizing key control points or defending their positions These are truly epic battles that unfold on maps It should be noted that you have a task at your starting point basein which you produce your unitssoldiers or equipment Collect this shock groups and participate in exciting battlesin which every soldier and every drop of his blood is like a Victory flagand bring you a truly unforgettable pleasure from each battle After allthe balance system is made almost perfect Whether it be 1 vs 1 or  vs in any caseyou will receive an unforgettable feeling of this spirit of a heavy and bloody Victory that we inherited from our grandparentsas I would not like to talk a lot about the company In factthese are quite good missions in which you can test your knowledge of tactics and strategies You really get more fun from additional missions from the DLC than from the main campaign of the game For this reasonI advise you definitely to buy additional missions that are not related to the main plot of the game You can relate to the main story with ironybecause there is nothing in it The history that the main story tells us is a unipolar view of the events of the Second World Warso I want to emphasize once again that you should take this view of developers to events of the past with irony and a lighter look And be sure to get a DLC to enjoy the mission and actually get the real Second World Warwhich we were waiting forbut when we talk about strategieswe always put this in the end  because strategy is important for its gameplay and tactical component that captures and strains your mind And we no longer look at the graphics or technologies that the developers use in those games But this game showed me that it can be beautiful And at the same time excitingand the technologies that are used here add a truly detailed realism of events unfolding on the screen If your computer does not have enough features to get the maximum settings and see all the features of this gamethen this is the case when you have to buy a new HardWare and see this Virtual World in the full palette of colors of Life and DeathAfter scrolling through many negative reviewsI began to realize that these reviews were not reviewing the game at allthey were just complaining about Relics business choices Now the amount of DLCs  Relic made for this game is shamefulbut the game is amazing and definitley worth the 30 dollars Rather then write a lengthy review i will just have people see how many hours I put into the game and have them judge for themselvesThere is Good in GoodbyeThanksHumbleBundleCoH3 whenIts good unless I losethen its badThere is Good in GoodbyeThis is a game my late brother loved more than all others Hed play this game religiously My favorite memory of him playing this game would be when hed use the command console to speed the game

and just being able to cooperate while playing spoiled me too much I will always look back on my time with this game fondly I hope anyone else out there can find just a positive experience with this Have a great dayI have to write this review as it troubles me greatly the way that SEGA are distributing games  I like Company of Heroes 2 and I like playing it just as I like the Total War series but I do not like the precedent that is being set through DLC and need to make others aware of itwhich no sane person would pay  Pleaseplease wait until the game and all its content are on sale to buy it else you feel like youve had a raw deal  I bought this game for £10 from a supermarket when it was on special offer and the deals Steam puts on can undercut that  I felt I had got a good deal but if I had paid £2999 I certainly would have felt cheatedmultiplayer serversmodders and the publisher could release updates for the game  Then the bad like publishers releasing buggyunfinished games which would then be patched later  Now we can add to that the insidious practice of DLC down loadable content that we must pay for to use  Now Im a realistsome DLC such as extra levels or new units may be worth paying for where it adds to the game and its here to stay  SEGA arent the only distributors to sell DLC but in the case of Company of Heroes 2 they do let you know what you havent gotone theatre of war and some commandersskins and intel bulletins for skirmishmultiplayer more on that later  So you have a relativity engaging single player campaign but for multiplayer you quickly realise youve just been sold a starter pack if you will and youre lacking a hell of a lot  That doesnt mean it isnt thereit just you cant use itArdennes Assault and Fox company rangers to try and get you to purchase them  It seems the game delights in showing you what you dont haveyou have to see them through the gamethose are CommandersSkins and Faceplatesall with associated costs  Then you thinwhat have I actually paid for other than the short campaign  A good Question and the answer raises more questionsStalingrad £699  Case Blue £699total of £1697the cost for all those bits of DLC for multiplayer  For those who aren’t familiar with the Company of Heroes games one of their traits is it allows you to select a commander  who has specific abilities that you can use to gain a tactical advantage during the game  This can be the ability to call in airstrikesoff map artilleryspecial units or uniquely powerful armoured units such as Tiger tanks  In the original game there were three commanders InfantryAirborne and Armoured  In this game there are lotsI don’t know how many but there’s a forum about it somewhere  Initially when you buy the game you get a basic number of commanders for the Soviets and the Werhmacht  I got a message that as a legacy player I’d unlocked some so I have a number that weren’t ‘unlocked’ with the base game  These are critical for your experience on multiplayer and skirmish as the computer can use commanders you don’t have access to and it will  Likewiseonline players may have access to that German commander who can call in a Tiger Ace a Tiger tank with full veterancy level and you don’t have a commander who can call in an equally powerful unit  This makes the game unbalancedso I talked about ‘unlocking’ commanders and earlier on I mentioned intel bulletins  Intelligence Bulletins change the mechanics of the game and you can select three from a vast number of options  Some are subtle such as giving machine guns a 2 faster rate of fire and some have a greater impact such as giving tanks 20 greater accuracy  You can’t buy these through DLC that’s no loss as there’s already plenty of that you have to ‘unlock’ them  You unlock more commandersintel bulletinsvehicle skins and other goodies via the war spoils system  This essentially involves grinding away for hours on skirmish matches to ‘win’ random war spoils  There’s no logic or pattern to what you getwhen you get it or how many get  For instance after one 20 minute game I won two war spoils and after one 1 hour game I got none  Plus you can get repeats like trading cards except you can’t trade them with anyone  So intel bulletins and commanders are classified as commonscarce and rare  The rare types being the more useful and more powerfulI want the special commanderscan’t I download them  Yes you canat a price through that store page accessed via the game  Now I’m not saying that anyone would buy all the commandersor that you would even need toespecially as many just have different combinations of the same abilities  But just say you’re a completestwell there are 1 x starter bundle of four commanders at £698 commanders at £279each8 commanders at £299each and 10 commanders at £199each  Total cost  £7263noyou can also alter the cosmetic appearance of the game with vehicle skins different camouflage paint jobs and for a full set you need three one for light vehiclesone for medium and one for heavy  Now I’m not big on paying for cosmetic changes but just say you wanted to as they were there and you wanted them all  There are two starter packs one Soviet and one German at £79each  There are then a whopping 0 extra skins at £159each  Total cost  £7318yes £1813surely you wouldn’t download all the cosmetic stuffjust what you want  This is truebut it’s not the point  You have paid £2999 for a game that is missing fundamental aspects to make it playable in multiplayer and the only way to get it is to pay morea lot more  I would never part with my hard earned cash to buy commanders which should be in the game I’ve bought  In fact they are in the gameI just can’t use them  Fix the war spoils systemreward players who are very good and very skilful with the better commandersdon’t fleece usstuff the gameplayit doesn’t matterno game is worth £2112 DLC cost plus base game costall full price to access all of its featuresnot oneeverbut please boycott paying for what’s in the game already  Don’t buy the commanderseven those you really want or need  £299 may not sound like a lot but you can often buy a FULL game for that on a Steam offer  You’re paying to use a single special unit that the computer can use at will  It sucksOnce you buy the gameyou have to spend another 60 to play the other half of the game In fact its more like 3th of the game
0,After a lot of hours in the game i can saysometimes u really feel the battlethe play time from 1030 minjust minor bugsIf you want to get BANNED for no reason play this game of my friends got banned for no reason at allthe funny thing about this that 1 of them stopped playing the game for a month and he still got bannedbut the other 1 spoke to the admins of the game and she replayed as follow  ChenshuToday at 60 PM u have been banned for hacking BIG PROGRESSION ISSUES Once you reach level 30 which happens very fast  You move from the newbie 19 matchmaking pool into the general matchmaking pool While that itself shouldnt be a big deal there are several problems which make this a complete brick wall for progressing your hero and soldiershaving much better gear and units The Gulf is huge  The units alone are so insanely more powerful than your own heroUnits that is virtually impossible to do anythingGenerallyI would say this game has a great potential and new ideas which worth trying and playingbut suddenly the matchmaking starts putting you with people which is 50 levels higher than you They come with very highly upgraded weaponry and units and you and your squad can’t even scratch his paintsome of them have abilities can kill your full health character within 3 seconds and you can’t do anything about it Many people just picking these characters for meta playthey can easily wipe you squad and kill your character and you cant even do anything except of running for every time you see these charactersyou will find less stuff and gears on the market and basically everything is hard to find comparing to other region servers They have added cross server matchmaking lately which is goodbut they didn’t do it for the market which give all other servers players advantage over you in term of available resources and gears Moreoverif you have a friend playing in another server you cant create a cross server party to play with him even with the cross server matchmakingbut theses issues is ruining every thing I have liked about this gameHi allI have been playing this game for more than 1000 hours and payed more than 500 for itthen got banned for no reason and when I asked them for a reason and a proof for banning me they did not provide anything for it and ignored me If you want to get banned for no reason I recommend that you play this gameIf you like games like Dynasty Warrioru will like this gameu might be okay with this gameu might be able to enjoy this gameud be okay in this gameminimap and enemy movements Cant be salty to your teammates when u isolate your archers and they get trampled by cavalry from your flankis of course limited Focusing on territory and house should be on the late gamenot early because the late game is literally thousands of other players fighting for territory There are thousands of houses and big alliances consist of veteran players Of course a new house is not gonna stand a chance in territory war So dont go off crying and complaining about your  member house with only 46 hours of play time cant get a territory and expecting the game will compensate u with something Its literally real life politics when it comes to Territory War and Alliances and territory are the end game rewardswhy the hell are new players even bitching about thisunitsgear crafting Having knowledge on this early in the game will help save u from a lot of resources being wastedthis game is really heavy towards meta U need to know which units are meta at the moment and play those because everyone in the late game will do itthis game can fun at times and frustrating at times Some people might like itsome people might not like it Some people try hard to get good at the gamesome might just complain and blame on maxed out units without understand the game concept To each its own I guess And my last piece of advice is do your preliminary research on the game as it will enable u to enjoy the game more from the start and prevent u from being salty later onThe devs of this game never listened to the advice of the community and also Lockdelete all the discussion of the problembalance topicSome players and families take advantage of the territory fightThe devs never made a compensation or hotfix of their problemNew ZealandersAustralians and Americans tend to share the same online servers if there arent dedicated NZAUS Servers this game oddly enough doesnt seem to allow for that and instead forces NZAUS Players Predominantly English speakers to play on AsiaPacific servers The irony is the AP Serverbased on its ping results is in the US anyway Alsoup until recently the game allowed South America and Asia Pacific players to play with one another But not NZAUS players with NA players THERES LITERALLY AN INTERNET CABLE CONNECTING NZ AND AUS TO CALIFORNIABeen playing since Feb 01 and Id say this game definitely deserves a thumbs up at this pointbut very annoying if youre just looking for a fair 15v15 match for funI gave it another shot and realise the depth and somewhat balanced gameplaythe game does extremely poorly at easing in new playersyour new player experience will be shti just want my siege battle to be funwth is thisand I wasnt disappointed when I decided to try it one month later Now Im happily discarding my green horses and other random sht Not a time waster at allI decided to invest energy into figuring it out by watching youtube vids But most of these seem unnecessarily convoluted and doesnt add value to whats great about this gameit really took me this long to properly learn and enjoy the first  weapons On the other handits not like I can just grab a bunch of green weapon and armour and expect to do okay in matchmaking Everything is a grind herebut its fun when youre finally therewhere the entire game economy forms a loop by itself and drains the ingame currency thru wear and tear This game has all of those elements but at least in my serverthere isnt an actual free market going on All the green tier resources and loot drops are salvaged or outright discarded coz nobody is buying them Or maybe all the wear and tear is going to the Winged hussars kits where a few dozen hardcore players are pouring tons of money in territory war its like playing two entirely different gameseach with its own funafter you grind your ass off till your gold tier and meta unitsIm just grateful that no unit is exclusively pwmaking this grind a minor inconvenienceId spend so much money on the cosmetics and spend my time ENJOYING the actual game Just look at dota  I might be wrong given that I wouldnt know the actual business model and the things this company has to deal with financially But one thing is for surethis whole grindfest and convoluted things is not going to bring in new players quickly Or maybe thats their strategy so that their servers can keep up hahahaalso the skill points Watch some youtube guides and gameplay to see which you like Good news is that there isnt really a bad weapon to speak of I see all kinds of weapons being mvp of the matchiron cap swordsmenspear seargentyoull see maybe 1 glaive0 nodachi and 0 poleaxe per team So thats the meta currently Although therere few dual bladesshort bow and even long swordid say that these fulfill a niche role for the team per game This doesnt mean that these weapons suckim sure theyre lots of fun too although I havent tried them myself It just means that they currently suck for tournaments hahaThis game totally chinese If you dont want to get bannedjust make friend with the Chinese If you fight themdont trash talk They can talk shit about your countriesyour racebut in case you telling same thing to themboomyou get banned for 30 daysJust waiting for this game to blow up so that queue times get shorterIts a good gamebut damn most chinese players are toxic AF They will bully and gang up on you if they dont get what they want I was on a team of Chinese Players on Strength In Numbersthey called me names and used artilleries on my troopsjust because i brought some ranged unitsGame is terribly unbalancedcasual matchmaking makes lvl 30 players less than 5 hours of game face lvl 300 playerswhich in a game shouldnt be that much of a problem except that it has MMORPG formula and that lvl 300 player three hits not only the new player but also his entire regimentnot pay to winSevere progression issue for new free playersat level 30 you start to enter the next tier of match making poolwhere you face off level 50 opponents with fully decked out troops and equipmentwhile the game expects you to make do with the supplied lv10 equipment and troopsridiculous This is a PVP gamesuch progression system creates a huge gap between opponents of the same class It is ok to make players choose between skill treesbut locking is just plain stupid Very bad ideawe are only humans and we can all understand that some might not want spend that amount of bronze per game just for repairssame issue Ridiculous  Max durability  system You will always be farming for bronze and silver JUST TO REPAIR and  RECONDITION  your set pieceYes you can  Recondition  a piece of equipmentat lower cost than the crafting requirement to make it as good as newbut does that really solve the problem Youre literally stuck at doing thiseven after getting a full set of equipment you likeand by the time you farm for enough materials to  RECONDITION   that 1 pieceyour next piece is already unusable and needs to be  RECONDITIONED or if they faila heavy price to pay A very vicious cycle really Its a gambling game alreadyand they exploit this They know what you thinkhow you thinkand they entice you by selling you cash troops which are free of repair cost Very schemingand when everyone enjoys the game they playthey are more likely to invest into the premium benefits that the game offers Win  WinI dont know why there are so many bad reviews But this game is awesome Playing from AustraliaIts a really good game in terms of gameplay It does not have too high requirementshousesminesetc BUT there is absolutely no point if you are new Literally all the territories on the MASSIVE map are owned predominantly my 35 major houses which makes it impossible for new players or houses to do anything These houses have extremely high level players you dont stand a chance against whatsoever because of them having significantly better gear and maxed out troops Its really sad that such a wonderful mechanic is beyond a significant amount of playerbase because of such cartelisation where you have to join these houses or make an alliance with them or else you dont stand a chancethe combat mechanicsabilitiesgame modes are reallyreally interesting and fun to playalbeit you get matched with a similar player level which is very rare and not extremely high player levelsGreat game  Bad serverTotal War  For Honor  The Priceyou would see Tposing teammates or Invisible Cavalry which are extremely rareYou can get all the strongest units and items through playing the game normally Yes you can use real money to speed up this process which first of allliterally all games allow to you use real money to speed up grindy processesand second there are no other PW aspects in Conquerors BladeOverall a decent game but the Chinese players are rude and when they do typespeak in english its usually insults
1,Im going to recommend this game but Im doing so very reluctantly Last night was the last time I logged in because I decided to quit the game after playing for around 5 monthsto anyone reading thisAlbion Online is a game made around PvP PvP is its heart no matter what anyone else gonna tell you Even if you want to steer clear from PvP and focus only on gatheringrefiningcrafting you STILL have to deal with PvP in terms of gankersI took whichever path I thought was the safest 0 gankers showed up out of nowhere and melted my mount T6 Ox within second and killed me My gear and my loot was worth around 5m silver for anyone playing the game for around 5 monthsthats a big amount of silver It was dishearteningI was quite annoyed at first but a few hours later I left it behind meon a daily basis I gather my herbs and then craft potion Afterward I would move to a Royal City to sell my potion I gathered my herd I crafted my potion I was on my way to the royal city Once moretook what I thought was going to be a safe route againnot the same everyday When I was literally a few feet from the entrance of a safe zone0 people showed up from nowhere again and ganked me Effectively looting me from another 5m silver worth of equipment and potionI was completely crushed Nowwhile I lost 3m silver and for most people who are just starting out it would be a huge lost for me it was a huge lost which I knew I could come back from From day  of playing this game Ive been super optimal in what I do and would always look for the best way to invest my silver to build a steady stream of revenue I knew the lost silver probably represent 5  6 of what Id possibly make in one month or even less if I scale the stuff I do BUT I just dont want to deal with this anymore The negative feeling I got in that momentthe mood shifting from happy crafter to depressed because of a silly game and virtual currency Nahthis is not for meI dont want to deal with thatyoure probably safe Against 2it could be hectic if your mount is weak Against 3the chance of escape starts to become slim but its there Against 4you might get super lucky or theyre awfully dumb as a rock Against 5 Against TEN Nahjust stand there and accept your fatewhat youre paying the scout might negate any revenue youd make gathering early onits just part of the cycle My wall of text is not a big sign telling you to go backits just a stern warning of what youre getting intoyoure gonna find a great amount of joy in this game People who wants to steer clear from PvP You cant Full stopIm still giving this a recommend because the game is good The system works as intended Just keep in mind that PvP is the core of this game and theres no escaping from thisThis game is great Its a hardcore runescape Then you learn that the entire game is only playable in pvp zones in the late game Then you learn that the game is only filled with ganking people Any time you go into these zonesyou run into players with far higher gear that is impossible to fight and they brought their friends too If there was a way to play the game in pve with my friendsI would I left a while back because everyone of my friends left the game for this reason 8 people With no people to interact with beyond killing me on siteits pointless I wish we could play the game without lossing hours worth of grinding in less than 30 seconds There is my ReviewAlbion is one of the most polarising games which i played I read good and bad reviews about the gameThe game is REALLY FUNi admit iti love the FREEDOM you have when you end the tutorialthe SIMPLE and GREAT visual design ANIMATION reminds me old but great classic RPG gamesand you can do whatever combination of equipment is awesome BUT  you will realize soon how frustrant is trying to get better gear without getting gank and the toxicity inside of the gamebecause yeathis game have a strong PvP based and its OKactually i love the PvP implemetationeven more the Arenasso i dont mindbut not everyone have 2050 guild members friends to cover protect you meanwhile you are doing some dungeons spending your time collecting looting just to get killed by 7 people  who the only objective is that on the game stealing everythingmaking the game more like a PSYCHOAMBUSHBULLY SIMULATOR more than a RPG with tons of freedomALSO theres just  SERVER FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD located in US in a PvP FOCUSED GAME Where MILISECONDS MATTER lucky for the ones who lives in US i guessand i knowi know theres people who the game runs without lag even outside of US but thats doesnt mean theres not people with lag problems out thereeven more if you live in another country Sad my relation with the game will end like thisbecause i like it honestly but as i said not everyone have tons of friends or time to coordinate to cover you when you do your stuff and avoid get steal Killedsome people just wanna enjoy the PvE content alone or with friends or gather their stuff in peacei think if they create another continent just for doing full PvE content full blue zone and leave the black zone for thoses people with big guilds people who want to do full PvPAmbush stuff then great but right now as i said is a great RPG untill you end the tutorial and reach T4T5 set and you need to start to get in killeable areas to continue progressing and then you realize how toxic start to be the peoplethe creativity of people to do bad things and how SCREWED you are if you are just a solo random person who want to pass a great time ingame well it transforms to be a GREAT and FREEDOM SIMPLE RPG build class to BULLY TOXIC TACTICS SIMULATOR  server lag edition GoTY Sad it ends like that RegardsAfter the tutorialI played for a good 3 hours or something and immediately I get greeted by some guild that wont leave me aloneto then realize you couldve just bought it for cheap on the marketvery immersive 0bThe game is fun on paperbut I dont love it in practicewhich is fine if you live in the United Statesbut it can become unplayable if you live anywhere else in the worldyou need to have many people to play with  After the initial first zonesthe game becomes open to any PvP  After some safe PvP zonesshould you continue to progressyou will be put into PvP zones where dying makes you drop everything including your equipment  As you can imagineyou cant last long in these zones without witnessing a bloodbathan atmosphere where everyone must work together would make you think that it would be easy to find a helpful communityright  Wellno  The friendliest guilds Ive seen have strict requirements before youre permitted entry  Honestlyas a solo playerI could never meet those requirements  The last straw for me was when I finally joined a guild that I thought was helping me out  I worked hard in my profession to gather up a decent amount of money to contribute to my guild as a whole and then I got kicked  It turned out my friendly startup guild was a scam to get me to donate resourcesand scam guilds are a lot more common than youd like to believebut the community is toxic  Unless you get luckyor are introduced by a friend who has already settled in somewhere decentyou probably wont make it  I used to think that determination was going to get me ahead of the curveor at least out of this early game slump  It mightbut Ive gotten to the point where my efforts are only exploited for other players gainand after weeks of work I never come out with anything to show for itdont get me wrong  I love sandbox MMOs  This one just has too much of an emphasis on zerg guilds  There is no reason to be a part of a community that is anything less than ginormous  This isnt for megood for you  None of my friends stayedand after wasting another several weeks trying to make it work for myselfI had to throw in the towel as well  Just rememberif you become the one that scams new playersor the one that groups up in PvP zones just to gank people who dont even have the gear to beat you in a v in the first placeyouve become part of the problemFounder Since Beta aka the glory daysnested portal dungeonsharbor townsblack zone citiesetc really hurt the direction of the game IMO SBI became obsessed with their consensualnonconsensual pvp and forgot to focus on developing their sandbox elementsand gaining a negative rep has no redeemable qualities It takes weeksif not months to reverse what rep damage you can do in a single day They had an opportunity to create pirate cities where criminals had to spawn and live out of and form their own ecosystem A bounty systemif developed correctly could add meaning to the reputation systemand now its gone for better or worseWARNING IF YOU ARE PVE PLAYER WHO HATES ANY PVP WITH PASSIONTHIS GAME IS NOT FOR YOUso be warnedyou may not enjoy high pinglagg and rubber banding which given that Albion online is full loot pvp game may ruin it for yousince all of the above are out of the waywe can discuss this awesome game Yesits grindy as hellone can grind till the end of time and then some more Even one of my friendswho really enjoys grindingcould not withstand the grindbut to be fairits one of the charming aspects of this game No matters whats happened to youyou can always return to safe zones and grind for some resourcesclear some dungeons and make some quick back to fund your pvp exploits As a player driven economy always will need resourceseven low level tierhigh revardbut how long before you will look for better hunting grounds Full loot pvp sounds scarier then it is As every veteran player will tell youdont go in redblack zones with gear which you cant afford to lose As game have been designedyou can craft or buy lower tier T4 T42 and still make some runs in to the abyss There has to be a good balance of skillgear and knowing when tonot to fight And its also possible to run awayeven so I managed to farmdo solo dungeons Even sostand one against 2 and surviveor help another when he get ganked Its all about earning more then loosing One successful dungeon run in black zone may be enough to cover 0 bad ones One successful farming session in red may cover 0 failed oneswhich I would say is entry lvl gear for pvp zones So each weapon category has different skillssame with armor and one can quite fast find things what works for him Even bettermaster a lot of them and you can switch around for whatever task you gonna do farmingpvepvpyes its grindybut no matter what path you will chooseyou will always feel growing and progressing Yes there will be bad dayswith sorrow and lost fortunebut that only will make good days feel better It may feel like other jobmore so if you have premiumbut there is no another game like thisYetAfter so many hours i can say i know the gameplayersDEVsmany ways Lets use their textno restrictionsothers you will not even remember the namesOklet me start with this if you want to PvEdo NOT pick this game up Most PvE content is really boringand the fun stuff the Avalonian stuff is all in fullloot PvP areas infested with people who want your gearruining the fun of PvE I wouldnt give a thumbs down for this thosince the game is not really focused on PvE although there would be potential for that tooreal shame for itbut it works well Now the bad part comes theres no fun in it Absolutely none Since the game is PvP focusedif a build with a unique idea comes upyou can bet your soul its gonna be nerfed or deleted Forget your creativity if youre trying to make buildsjust follow the metacause the developers are actively working against interesting builds This is one of the reasons Im giving the thumbs down I love theorycraftingbut honestlyonly the open world PvP is worth mentioningas the others v2v25v5 hellgates or arenas are decentbut there are games that focus on these types of matches and are a lot better at it If you think these gamemodes are funjust pick up a MOBA or a brawler LeagueDota2SMITEBattleriteetcthey have better fleshed out gameplay and are fairnot geardependent WellI guess I can recommend it if you want a watereddown MOBA that you can pay and grind to win Not saying theres no skill involvedthere definitely isjust not as much as other gamessmallscale openworld PvP is fun if youre a griefer Thats it Its all about ruining other peoples fun You go in with better gear  and more peopleyou win And then comes someone with even better gear or more people and wins This game allows griefers to grief to their hearts contents Its all about the big fish chasing the small fish Occasionally there can be some fun fights that are undecided until the endbut these are raritiesthis game shines when it comes to largescale openworld PvP When its happeningits fun But theres a catch It  takes preparation to assemble the partiesto make sure the partys gear is metaand to physically get to the place of the war It can be hours And then theres the fact that the zones have player limitsso not everyone can fight at the same timesome will wait outside the zone until some space is freed up and while the fights can last quite a long timeunless youre the commanderyour part might actually be over in mere minutesand then you can spend 5 to 30 minutes getting back And if this wasnt enoughfights not always happen in factusually the team with less people will scout out the enemyand decide to retreat So both teams just spent that time preparing for a huge nothing This is Albion Onlinea game where you spend more time trying to find the content than actually doing the contentthat needs grinding before actually being profitable You cant customize gearso theres no point in handcrafted itemsand the prices on the market are fairSo if youre not in it for the moneycrafting is pointless And for the fun factorgathering is basically just running around the mapclicking on a resourceand waiting for it to gather Crafting is checking the market for what is worth craftingand then clicking a button to masscraft an itembut not anything amazing Searching for loopholes in the market and abusing it until the prices normalize can be quite amusing I had fun with it for a while but its not really my thingId rather fight This game is a sandbox MMORPGand not a market simso Im not gonna recommend it just for good tradingthis game has politicswhich includes alliancesmarket controlarea controlbribestaxfees for servicesand fights for territories Its a lot like reallife politics That aint a good thing Basicallyimagine real life politicsbut now instead of needing charisma and moneyyou only need charisma to be a leaderso the leaders are charismatic idiots with hundred times the ego of a normal person most of the time Alsothere are no consequences for doing something morally questionablebecause its a game Sounds fun right Thats Albion politics in a nutshelland since its fulllootyoure gonna lose that gear over and over again So you need that money over and over again Everyone wants money Nobody wants to lose gear Everyone wants to get your gear This means that people dont take fights that are not clearly in their favor Which results in PvP being stomped or being the stomper This is not healthy for a game where fun is the whole point But that leads me to my final pointand more and more about getting in game money for that premium which can be purchased for in game moneyfor better gear so you can be the stomperfor investing so you can make more moneyetc Thankfully I realized this before I spent too much time just grinding moneyand after that I spent my money on just having fun And while the content in the game is fun for a short while if you have the moneyit gets boring And of course you cant really do PvE for fun because of the gankers so thats that After trying to enjoy the gameI ended up deleting itbecause it just wasnt that fun And to this daythis is probably the only game I regret spending a bunch of time on I feel like it was a waste While I miss what this game could have been with a better community and less of a focus on moneyI do NOT miss what the game IS one bit Good riddance Somehow this game managed to create gameplay out of grinding for money for the sake of grinding for moneyand most players fall for itmyself includedand I repeatthe ONLY reason you should pick up this game besides griefing is if you want to be a part of a big group And by that I mean 0 or heck even 00 players playing together at the same timein a big discord call Having fun as a big group is the only thing this game is good atYou will notice a large amount of people posting negative reviews are the ones who complain the game is too unforgiving Theyll say its unpleasant dying to groups larger than themand how if they cant play solothe game therefore suckseverything youre wearing and anything in your inventory is dropped or trashed Its written on the doorway outsideif you dont like it dont play it If Im allergic to fishIm not gonna go to a seafood restaurant and order troutthen post a bad google review saying it almost killed mewhich is the strongest aspect of the game PvE leaves quite a bit to be desiredbut in the end its all used to get stronger for PvP Groups can literally gank you inside a dungeonraid and lay waste to you Its called divingand its awesome Totally possible to fight back and win as wellit happens all the time If you are not someone who enjoys plentiful amounts of consensual  non consensual PvPthis is not the game for youkeep looking elsewherebut this game as well as other MMOs are designed specifically to play with other people Playing solo in this game is definitely possiblebut it takes a great amount of patience and practiceas well as a deep understanding of gear interactions and game mechanics These are things youll learn if you just join a damn guild Dont be scared to be social in an MMOthere are plenty of great guilds out there for beginners and veterans alike Start in a guild at leastthere are so many people willing to help newer players even in competitive highstakes games like Albion Some guy posted a review saying most guilds require you to pay them to get in Ive never seen this in my almost 2k hoursbut maybe I havent looked at enough trashscam guildsthe game is great For meI could never get into themepark MMOs I played Rust since legacyand dabbled a bit in EVE online I also played a lot of league back in the day I like to think Ive grown since thenbut I digress If you really want to compare Albion to anything elseit should be those three games Take the full loot adrenaline based gameplay from Rustuse the moment to moment gameplay from league isometric6 ability action combat w 2 consumablesand then take the economy aspect from EVE Everything is player crafted and bought and sold on separate auction houses across the game world Why separate Why not OSRS Grand exchange style Some continentszones give only certain resourcesand the cities near them give refining bonuses to mats found far away This creates incentives to move around and find arbitrage opportunities You can purely play economic PvP in this game if you want Transporting goods is a very lucrative activityand therefore ganking those goods is just as lucrative The game is also a sandboxso players more or less make the content for themselves If you log on every day expecting organized groups for gankingroaminggatheringPvE in your guildit might not work out so well Try being a leader and being the change you want to see if no one is running a group It wont be easyyou might get your friends killed a couple timesbut you gotta learn somehow Everyone starts at the bottomand the only thing separating the good players from the bad are the ones who stick through the rough stuff and keep working at itif youre considering the same activitythen yes But there is large scale PvPPvE in Albion and there is small scale There is catchinggankingthere is escaping those people There is gatheringthere is solo play Most weapons and armor are only good at one or two of those thingsso what you end up with is a different sort of meta based on your group size Theres enough variation and frequent balance passes to address absolutely useless items as wellwhich results in these metas shifting sometimespeople keep gang fucking me Join a guildgo ganking with themsee how its done Then youll know how to avoid it There are plenty of gatherers that go without being killed gathering for months at a time PersonallyIve never been ganked while gathering T8 hides I dont do it too often to be fairbut when I do I make sure Im wearing proper escape gear and that Im farming near safe territoriesand you can buy gold with it on the ingame gold market Gold is used to buy premium gives more fameexppassive crafting pointsetc as well as cosmeticsof which you can disable in the PvP zones if you want Personally Ive always been able to pay my monthly premium with silverand Ive been playing since steam release On the note of people paying for gear with IRL moneyIn realitythe people who swipe their credit cards for gucci gear are way too afraid to leave the safe zones  almost negligible fameyou will never progress here When they dopeople see that theyre juiced and pile on like a bunch of coked out hyenas Its an amazing system If you try to P2W in this gameI can almost guarantee youll end up making someone else rich You need mechanical skill and experience to truly be successful in PvPgear quality only helps up to a pointand theyve shown it time and time againwith the icing on the cake being this most recent update Theres too much for me to put into this reviewbut know this they arent going to give up on this game anytime soonand its slowly becoming more populated This is nothing short of a marvel for MMOs today Most start strong and fade quicklybut not here I have great faith in this game and the developersand they have some great content coming down the pipe for the next updateand Ill personally take some time and answer questions for you that you may have Alternativelyif were fullsend me a whisper in game BeeRye Id be happy to give you a handSo farAlbion isnt really a newbiefriendly gamebut once you get some levels and experience upyoull get the game to its full potentialto large 00 people zerg vs zergshuge guildsand plenty of things to do as a groupbut your quest is mainly to be the richest i guessbut really cool for melots of things to do even if youre not upgraded to premiummeaning you can go any characterany buildanytime you wantas I previously mentionedwhich makes the game alot more exciting and challengingusually just spend 0 on  month of premium or even just earn ingame currency to get your first month of premiumterritoriescastlesetcfarmsetcwith a mix of some Dota 2its really grindy to get higher tier items and rare stufftook me a decent week to max out my gathering skillinflation of items are inevitablelots of players are shit and raises the tax to 999 in crafting stationsand most of the stations in major cities are owned by players and large guildsas a solo player myselfits really fucking bad to play this game alone With full loot PvP in the open worldyoull always go against 3 people or moreguilds own most of the territory and would instantly kill anyone they meet that arent their teammateswhich is NA As a SEA playerand the vast majority of the players from EUit brings lots of us in a disadvantageespecially in PvPunless you got a group of some sortnot good for people with lowend PCs even if it has Dota 2 graphicslarge scale fullloot pvpplayer driven economy with lots of unfair taxes and prices but mostly normalyou can be any class or equip any item at any timeyet it feels really nostalgic Lots of frame and ping lagespecially if youre in SEA or EU or any other place other than NA But a really good game so fareven as a sandboxit feels like you always have something to doMy steps in Albion Online  Tutorial phasebut did not want to before trying out the gameI logged inI picked a starter city Oh I got disconnected four times during the tutorial Each time it took over an hour to log back in So to finish the 45 ish minute tutorial took me 4 hours because of the disconnects and queuebut give nothing So they get your hard earned moneybut give nothing in return As a new playermake sure to not join one that charges more than 5 I was in one that charged 50 because they promised gear once I get to T4  which they did not deliverthey take your money With all the lag and stutterit is easy to click on yes by accidentyou need to be a subscriberbut the developer seems to be fixing things I am now always less than 5000 in line and it takes about 2040 minutesbut whateverso I lose everything except my silver I get more gear and go find some solo noob exploring and treasure hunting I kill him and end up looting treasures worth a few hundred thousand silversafer wayand try to avoid gankersbut eventually I made enough silver to buy the premium subscription Yesyou can use the in game currency to get premium I am now not at all affected by the terrible queue system I also decided to throw the developers some money and bought the new player starter packcraftingbreedingand fishing Love the game so farbut you should give it a few weeks to calm down and improve Other than the tax issue I mentionedthe developers seem to be competent and listen to playersbut with much better graphicsbut supposedly thats coming down the line The current solo dungeons are quite boringand melee classes have issues with thempreferably an archer or nature staff userI would say a 70 If they also fix the tax exploiters targeting new playersI would easily bump it up to an 80Great game But theres a couple of things that are gamebreaking for meor EU But for anyone playing from SEAI wouldnt recommend itand its not filled with microtransactionsthis and that event to make you pay for contentdlcspremium only content etcgood PVE contentbut I just take that into account and adjust my strategyothers will hate it Personally I dont mind itneither good nor bad Even though Im more of a solo player this hasnt affected me too badlyif you dont its still completely doable I dont mind the grind because theres a lot of fun elements to itbut some players hate itthe combat is slow paced and players with high ping can still keep upI guess the peak times for EU and NAits just completely unplayableyou will be drawn back dozens of timesyou will have enemies teleporting aroundyoull fly back into enemy abilitiesyoull get kicked to the main menu and reconnected dozens of times etcor will it Wellfor someone who spends most of their time solo in the black zonesit actually willa logout timer will start counting down Ive seen it start at 60 seconds and go downand Ive seen it start at 300 seconds Both of which are ridiculously high85 seconds are more than enough to kill a player trying to run from a fight using a disconnect Hes afkcant defend himself and just stands there taking damagefree for anyone to just stroll up kill me and get lootonly to find I have been knocked out 46 times in a row by the mobs I was fighting while I got disconnected I stood upI got knocked outwaited 8 secondsstood up againknocked down again 46 times Thats ridiculous One time Sure But at some point you got to just log the player outwhere the devs know and admitted themselves there would be a portion of players suffering from connectivity issuesthis clearly has not been thought through at allits happened to me a lot Sure its a bit unforgiving but overall its still quite funand Im not left feeling bitter after I lose a fighteven if it was an unfair fight like 45 vs  Its finethats how the game goes But Im sure that the above is not exactly meant to happen and it certainly doesnt make for a fun experience when your progress is just wiped out because the laggy servers dropped you Not coolThis game is plagued by huge guildsalliances that monopolize territories to the point where you cant farm or gather the higher tier resources without the threat of being ganked Imagine being a skinner Like myself You go out to the black zone and skin for 3045 mins until your Pork Pie is upand you head back with you 200300  hides and run into a group gankers that kill you All that work wasted and now you have to buy a new set of skinning geara new weapon AND a new mount The game is incredibly unforgiving OH and these giant said guildalliances will more often than not CHARGE you a fee if you want to join I have over 40 hours in on this gameup to t8 skinning and am just over the constant anxiety of being killed while Im trying to have funIf you like PvPlooting people you killplayer driven economies and Moba style combatyou will like this gameyou wont like this gameFelt punishing for new playersbut most content in the game is pvp centered sooo Yeahthere are lots of content to learn and experience Although I would say that its really hard to progress into high tier play because you can literally lose everything you got on your characterequiplootetc just by being at the wrong place at the wrong time You are heavily reliant on a guild if you wanna progress beyond the cities starting zonesbut only to a certain extent and seems like its not intended or encouraged to do so by game designbut if I was asked to recommend this game I wouldnt You definitely will have a lot of bitter experiences and most of time you have no idea what you are doing because the game just dosent explain the hows and whys very welljust sharing my experience of it and at least give it a try before making your own judgementbut I quickly found out that endgame is poorly explainedactually not explained at all and unless you are in a active highend guild that is willing to help their newer players endgame content will only be a lowreward highrisk for youSowhat to expect from this gameor just hold the leftright mouse button can be frustrating because of the fixed angle and limited zoom option whereas the map is quite big THIS SUCKS EVEN MOREyou can expect big profit loss even after you gathered for hoursto get your own island which only costs 70 K silver But its worth itand you only have to pay for it once just get ready to farm for quite some timethats that from methanks for reading my reviewSHOO Dont waste your time herejust trust meAlbions core gameplay is fine Howeverthe way some mechanics are implemented are not Ill go by an comparison to Black Desert Onlineworld bosses spawn the same at set locationswith public timers This is same for both games Howeverthe major difference here iseven though both games are primarily focused at PVPBDO forces you to flag for PVP before engagingeven at world bosses This makes it so that even solo characters are able to get some rewards from the boss itself In Albionhoweveryoure automatically flagged for PVP whenever you try to contest any given world event This in and of itselfis not a bad mechanic Howeverwith the way the community is shaped right nowunless youre a part of a big allianceyou wont even be able to attend to the event arealet alone to the event itself In my 64 hours of playtime with a group of friendsweve never been able to seelet alone doa world boss up close Big alliances with 200300 active members with gear that you could only dream of will raid the event areaknock down or kill depending on the area anyone that approaches There is only so much you can do when youre outnumbered hundred to one This is the only thing that I could say is a problem that is put there by the developersthe community itself Oh boy It boils my piss whenever I think of the encounters I haddieand complain about the tank failing their role Tanks will try to focus on their damage before survivability You will get flamed for playing your role properly You will get flamed more for not playing your role properly You will get flamed in the arena for not being able to win a 2v3 while that piece of shid guy who flamed you managed to lose a 2v You will get flamed in multiple languages Your party member which you wiped the whole dungeon with will quit the party the very last secondinteract with the ch
1,My pedigree 500 hours Shogun 2 Darthmod300 hours Warhammer mostly played Very Hardand generally volume wins However there is the notable shakeup offor better or worse Strong v generals will win battlesperiod Dueling and killing generals will crush morale and cheese fights just like targeted damage spam from Warhammer The AI is quick to accept and propose duels it cannot winand even when they reject them you can simply rightclick on them and get the same result So far I have not seen any troops be effective against highstat generals — its common to outmaneuver an invasion using your garrison troops to route the enemy only to have their general stick around and solo your remaining squadswhich I havent tried yetthere are more units than reviews insinuated Most of these are gated behind general archetypes and technology I can see these units substantially affecting the outcome of fights if you can afford them An example autocrossbow units from highCunning generals will grant you a highly costeffective ranged unit at the expense of a very weak general This might be a good choice for a defensive army that has walls to garrisonanother 25 for winter even in your own territory Once your supplies hit zero you suffer massive attrition losses This can be improved with infrastructure and character traitsbut without significant investments the net effect is that distant campaigns and prolonged sieges are extremely highrisk Aside from conquering armies and settlements there are no effective ways of replenishing your supplies during an invasion Thiscombined with the very slow replenishment of supplies and mustering of replacementsforces you to be very deliberate with your aggression and defense Gone are the days of spamming Ashigaru to handle an unexpected attackor endlessly raiding a territory while waiting for reinforcements Likewise the AI cant use these strategiessolving the catandmouse games everyone hated in Warhammerrequiring lots of forethoughteach replete with collateral effects and synergies that make you consider the province as a whole rather than the usual oneproblemonebuilding method were used to Compounding this is the commanderies system — known as provinces in Warhammerthese are groups of territories that are designed to be held together One territory of a commandery will contain the city and most of the buildingswhile attached territories will contain an exclusive building tree Because building synergies are so powerful you are highly incentivized to own an entire commandery instead of mere parts This adds more intrigue to expansionist aggression as well as the excellent diplomacy system — with good relations the AI will gladly trade territories of equal value with youbut it is also important to hire personalities who satisfy the needs of your economy vanguards are better for industrycommanders for peasantsetc Black sheep can still be effective so long as theyre kept away from their associates Failing to satisfy them can have heavy consequences — people with significant power in your government can even start a civil war In my first run I found myself occasionally firing people I hired with insufficient foresight to avoid showering them in promotions or letting tensions boil overoften having served other leaders before you This mostly has implications with Espionage which Im not experienced enough to talk about yetrefusing trade and breaking alliances randomly In Warhammer diplomacy was hardly possible at all From that low bar 3K has made massive improvements Leaders are generally more reasonable and fit their ascribed personalities well Diplomatic intrigue has so far satisfied me more than any Total War or 4xbut you will find yourself taking advantage of them more often Itemspaymentsand marriages can be used to appease leaders into treaties and trade agreementsand territories can be traded to mutual benefit Enemies can be effectively extorted when their backs are against the wall Cao Cao can stir the pot with the ability to start proxy warsas new members must be approved by a majority of existing onesand voting in opposition of members will sour your relations Furthermore people will not be interested in joining if your confederation is weak That means order is importantand you will want to confederate with the most widely liked and powerful factions first All of this complicates your expansionismperhaps forcing you to take risks on distant campaigns rather than upset an allyor an allysallyby attacking your bordersbuy one The more battles you have the more time youll spend loading Ive been enjoying 5 second loads on my M2which largely devolved into paintbynumbers spamfests Controlled growth is keyand many decisions will require you to think several turns ahead If youre playing Total War with an emphasis on battles with diverse armies and lots of spectacle you will be more at home in Warhammerbut hardcore strategists will love this gameI am a Chinese player and this is my first comment on steambecause you cannot find any historical mistakethe Chinese voice actors are excellentI recoginised that the voice actor of Zhengjiang 郑姜 is also for Sylvanas in WOW As a long time Total War fanI wasnt looking forward to this one  I have no interest in the time period or location  My favorites in the series are rome 2 and the warhammer series  I decided to give three kingdoms a tryand now I dont think I can ever go back  It is so goodit makes every previous TW seem archaic  Specificallydiplomacy and the campaign side of things have been improved so much  The choices you make affect so much more with coalitionsalliancesand vassals  There is a lot more character developmentto the point that you care so much about your council membersfamily membersand allies  These individuals become intertwinedforcing you to really think about each negotiation  Indeedif you lose a general you care aboutyour other generals in battle will go berserk with rage if they have developed a good relationshipbattles play absolutely beautiful  I have engaged large battles as often as I can to really push my computers limit i7 7700k6GB Ram080 Duke

they slowly turned the tide of war Now they are deep in my territory and are laying siege on my capital right now They also killed my beloved son and heir to the throne 200 would get destroyed by petty kingdoms againA Total War game with great optomization I never thought id see the dayIf your on the fence as to whether to buy this game please read below and decide for yourself if CreativeI know my answer and I think you will to shortly after readingto play 3 Kingdomsreached out to influencers I knowand am using social media to try and get this doneand just last week we were getting ready for him to have a bone marrow transfusion Unfortunately this past weekendthe cancer came back with a vengeanceand doctors don’t think he will last longthe 24th release date may be to lateI understand why you would feel this way Here is a link of him currently in the ICU httpimgurcomdBWKd3XuDogbertCA on here and Grace on twitter have made one kid extremely happy When I told him the good newshe criedand couldn’t believe this was happening When I told him who sent ithe was so shocked I then immediately got kicked out of the room to go home and download it since the internet at the hospital sucks I should be back there in a hour and he cant wait to playit means a lot And from meI don’t know much about this gamejust hear him always talking about it To see the outpouring of support from all of you is truly touching It means a ton to me and my familythank youthank youthank youand was so excited by the intro and being able to play Not sure what I can and can’t post so I took a picture of him at the logo screen and one of us He taught me what we had to doand we won the first battle thanks to him You guys are all amazing I will myself purchase the game when it comes outso that I’ll be able to cherish this moment forever Also I will be printing out all of your comments for him I read some to him and the smiles and laughs he got was tremendous So againthank youall of youI wont give our exact locationbut were in TampaFL Watching the intro video he was amazed and out gorgeous it was He went in to detail telling me about the different people we could choose frometc It was a student trains teacher moment I promise I will reply to each and everyone of youand this thread will always be something I come toon 059209just after midnightRobbie passed away I thank you all so much for everything these past 3 daysand the fact he was able to play his favorite game will always mean so much to me Thank youmaybe as a general or officerLet’s hope all the detailed character focus and massively improved diplomacy lead to a Medieval 3Short Version its fantastic go play it 90however not without tiny issues here and therethe production value is just a bit under Shogun 2  despite the lack of cutscenes there is plenty to appreciate  the beautifully done technologic treethe musicthe soundsambientarchitecture  its very well donehowever this is achieved by cutting from other places as a result you can get a whole lot of blurring even on ultra there are a lot of optionspersonally my favourite interactions are buying out provinces and selling crops I will never forget how i traded a bunch of rice and clay figurines for a marriage with legendary Lu Bu Agriculture0they are very fieldable units that can and will do workmoreover i have found that absolute majority of units are very much fieldable with respective expertise areas Peasants still perform awfully BUT compared to Shogun 2s Ashigaru units they cost more and do morehave infinitely more morale but less usewhile she does have predisposition to raiding and pillaging you wont be doing that forever Also unique unitsbut that RNG adds to the unique nature of every runsemi randomised trees which set hard lvl cap to 5 Its a far cry from Rome2Shogun2Warhammer  its just shitty in every way outside of multiple things in one ability Any time a hero is lvled up im not excited You pretty much dont get stats Best you can get is an ability on the field Or some passive buff for administratorcommander Thats about it Not excitingAt the time of this reviewI have completed seven separate campaignsand Im in the process of doing my eighth with Yan Baihu I feel that Ive played enough of TW3K to give an honest and informed opinion of the game Check my play history and youll see that Im a longtime Total War and strategy fanlook at Rome 2 That game is legitimately pretty decent now But reviews are about the current state of a gamenot my fondness for the series Three Kingdoms has been out for a year and a halfand it feels like I am playing an unfinished title I cannot speak for how the game played in previous iterations or even prior to the recent Nanman updatebut currently this game is not worth 60 USD or the 84 positive rating it has herefullpriced gameI expect at the very least an experience without game breaking bugs or issues which heavily affect my ability to literally play the game Is TW3K a fun game Yes I dont play games which I dont find fun Is it a good game Againyeahits solid Not the best Total Warbut it could most definitely reach that status in a few years Sowhy the negative review Simple the game is unpolishedcrashes frequently over two dozen times for mepoorly balancedand features several overpriced DLC that arent even particularly goodenemy generals also disappear And not because of ambushes Im talking a genuine bug that turns them invisible on the map and can completely screw up what you thought was an otherwise safe time to engage the enemy Combined with constant crashesmy 45 hours was honestly a chore sometimes to achieveTotal War has both never been better and never been worse Battles are fun Unique generals with personalities and rpglite elements make for an awesome emergent narrative experience Reminds me of Crusader Kings in a way Less deepbut very interesting The units look great and are a blast to use Theyve even color coded them basically by function Super convenient When things are goodtheyre great But when theyre badtheyre terrible Units are woefully unbalanced Nanman factions have ridiculously strong units which can easily overpower Han factions early game Not fun at all when you have to spend the majority of a campaign holding off invasions from those guys Nanman asidethe Han units are also really poorly balanced Only a few units are actually viable late game and stacking your armies full of them will net you stupidly easy autoresolves should you wish it Tactics are especially atrocious on Romance modewhere generals are big baddies that fuck up everything in their path Granted you can play without this or understand that 3K is ultimately more like Warhammer than classic TWbut it shouldnt be so blatantly arcadeI like playing this game Its fun It has massive potential If its on saleconsider it if you already know you love Total War games Full price Not a chance And honestlynot a chance of me editing this review to positive until CA addresses issues that prevent a truly immersive experience free from frustrationI think by now I can safely say that this is the best Total War game Ive ever playedheavily based off the 4th century novel about the time period Its absolutely beautifuland ancient china is as unique a setting as you can ask formeans that they can single handedly take on units of enemies This allows for an added element of epicness in your battles and feels really fresh and fun in battlethe duel system in which your general calls out another to engage in a v duel is some of the coolest stuff Ive ever seenthe amount of options you have for engaging in diplomacy with another faction makes it feel fun and essential to a campaignrather than being a means to an endthe different factions that you can play as all have their own unique playstyles While you can play as one of the three main charactersyou can also play bandits which can act as mercenariestraders which incredible manipulations skillswarlords who are unmatched in battle Lu Bu  Lu Bae etcbut something about it just feels brightb Its very satisfying to work your way up from a small lumber yard to an empireto factionsto campaignsit all feels very polished and at the peak of its potentialcavalryand infantryyou could have people in a city be extremely happy one turnand extremely angry in the next with the only indication being populationyoure not given enough things to actually equip to your characters The chance of finding a weapon or armor that would actually benefit a character are maybe 4 times a playthroughbut the new additions fit right into the game If I had to describe this game in one sentenceit would be Total War meets Crusader Kings 2 meets ancient china with a sprinkle of Dynasty WarriorsSurprised I didnt have to pay 499 to write a reviewIn short words this might be one of the best Total War games to date It connects good battles with many deep campaign mechanics that TWWarhammer games are lacking Im not fan of the setting and I was very sceptical about this titlebut since I bought itit grew on mewhich differ a bit Romance mod is the main with powerfulsingle entity heroes with abilities that can change the tide of battles Records mode nerf heroes a bitthey come with plenty of cavalry bodyguardsmore experienced your hero islarger bodyguards he have Also you can equip all your heroes with weaponsarmorsmountsancilliaries and followers which will make them appear different on the battlefield and grant them unique bonuses and abilitiesbut AI does decent job trying to use their  missile unitsflank with cavalryprotect archers with infantry Rarely I see them doing something illogical or dumb Battle AI is much more improved from Warhammer where it was very passive so you could easily use all your ammunition to kill it Now it moves away from the walls inside the city when you have advantage in range unitswhen it notices that you have no ammo left AI comes backtrying to defend the gatesblocking any breakthroughs with unitsmaking it difficult to get inside Even if you break the first lineusually there is second line of troops trying to block the streetsthey spread more units to block other ways inside My onli gripe was that town garrisons are pretty smallsmaller than minor towns garrisonsso you need to build special bulding for more unitsbut I think its a small issue because mods for bigger garrisons or maybe official patch should make this rightthere are militia one available for every faction and generalthere are few faction unitseach faction have usually 2 of themthere are special units unlocked by tech tree reforms which are called Dragons There are Dragons with axesswordscavalryarchers each call differently Most interesting are Azure Dragonsglaive infantry with bows They have special formation where two first lines form up against cavalry charge and rest is sitting behind and shooting from safe It should be mentioned that each general can recruit to 6 units and you have 5 different types of generalshigher general rank better special units he can recruit For example strategist on level 3 can recruit medium crossbowmen and on level 6 heavy crossbowmen and sentinel can recruit special medium sword infantry You can have maximum three generals in one armybut he said no everytime Not anymore Now you know exactly why they want peace or agreementsgame shows you how much points you need to make deal done For example if there is 50 when you are proposing peace it means you need to soften the deal with some cash If you crushed them in few battles the score might be 5that means you can order them to give you additional money or even force them into being your vassal There is also a great option with quick deal You click it and choose trade agreement and you see all guys who may want to trade with you It even says maybe or yes that means you need to offer those guys that are not convinced few things in returnbut if you have food surplus you might sell it to other lords for money or agreements If you have plenty of farmsbut not many high income regions you can get a lot of gold just from food distribution Population is coming backbigger the town isthe more people it can sustain and it gives bonuses to income and replenishment You need to upgrade your town to get more building slots and higher population capbut there is only few dozen of them When you play and recruit more they almost always look very simillarwith same bad weapons and armorso in the lategame when some of your heroes die of old age the game is a bit less interestingbut it helps that when you reach King rank three Kingdoms are formedleaders became Emperors and you need the other 2 of them to abdicate or conquer their emperor seat which is in their capital Its pretty interesting mechanic because Emperors still can make peace and trade agreements but cant ally with each other If you have a slower start it might happen that AI trigger the event and you wont even be one of the Emperors Then you need to capture one of the seats for you to become a pretenderbut nothing game breaking or annoying enough to make me stop playing Satisfaction mechanic and relations between characters should be more impactful Spy system is interesting and you can do amazing things with itbut your spies need a bit of luck to get hired by other factions to make it worthwhilepleasant for ears There are also cool options to choose fromlike changing colour palettes you can use Romance palette while playing in Records modeetc There are unit cards and alternative unit cardsenglish or chinese voiceovers with english subtitles Not everyone might like itbut characters do a bit trashtalking during battlessome lines are a bit cringebut I mostly like thembut it is probably the best release of CA game in the studio history Battles are goodcampaign is great and character focus is making this game a bit more interesting Few small patches and mods should make this a masterpieceIf you are not Chineseyou probably have a hard time imagining what Four Masterpieces mean to us When I was a childI used to read Romance of Three Kingdoms twice a year during holidays We were eager to experience that part of the history covered by the fog of war and politics via video games That was exactly the time when the art of war in ancient China has reached a whole new level During a very long timeour only options are games developed by KOEI Dont get me wrongtheir games are great well at least some of them are And you know what You changed this situation Now if you ask a Chinese player what is the best game based on the history of three kingdomstheir answers are probably gonna switch to the Total War seriesI am so glad they ditched whatever system they were trying to put together in Thrones of Britannia This installation of Total War is absolutely phenomenal With a steep learning curve that is made pretty userfriendly via excellent tutorialthis game brings city managementcharacter managementand army builds to a whole new level Theres a large gap between the kind of game this and previous historical total warsbut this timeunlike ToBthat gap is perfectly executed and finetuned into a game that has removed my skepticism of future Total Wars all togetherCampaign AI plays by a different set of ruleswhich limits your options to outplay them For exampleyou cant destabilize your enemys public order by going for their food production in a prolonged war Even a single city under siege manages positive food production and the upkeep necessary to maintain an army large enough to equal that of your 4 commanderies regionsevery timeis direct military confrontation Badcheating as admitted by CA AI ruins replay value and severely limits strategic depthIts has a much bigger map than normal total war gamesFamily treehFIRST IMPRESSIONhbeautifuland well optimisedStarwarsWH40K would be absolutely fricking

buffer against himfinally a chance to gain some land and increase my coffersgiving way for my smaller force to pick at the scraps and gainYuan Shao joining the melee as the hounds fall upon the limping gazellemy capitalI will not let it fallIm enjoying the game so far but the combat animations are pretty disappointing compared to Shogun 2 and Rome 2s sync v animations Just a lot of air stabbing and when arrows hit individuals they dont falljust random individuals in the unit will randomly drop and Im the one to always zoom into battles to watch the intense fightsso to see no v animations again its a bit of a let down I know that the vs caused some issues with the AI just standing and watching but I personally prefer that much more than a simple slash and the enemy falling down because It makes it feel more like a realistic setting Alsothe duels can get pretty repetitive after a few times Everything else seems like an improvement so if you dont mind that then you should love this game The campaign map is definitely a jump in the right direction which I much prefer over previous titles Not going to give this game a bad review based solely on the combat animations but would like to see them introduced again in the future Thanks for reading This is one of those games where a fundamental change paid off Unlike other Total War titlesthis game is focused on diplomacyrather than the outcomes of the battles You are surrounded by nations on all sidesand shifting alliances make conflict a dangerous gambit You are forced to negotiate like a human beingrather than steamroll everything in sight with an army of heavy unitsand youll develop longterm alliances with certain neighbors A key difference between this game and previous titles is that youll almost never annex an entire faction in one war War is outright expensiveand the longer it drags onthe more the costs will weigh on you Furthermoreall nearby factions will watch the warring partiesand the more devious ones might launch an incursion into your lands whilst you are occupied elsewherein that its a constant back and forth between you and your rivals Youll eventually begin to develop something of a mutual respect for certain enemiesand youll find that different enemies use different tactics in battle

1,Kronii and bae bring me here dont askim gonna make porn of this gameGameplayyou can have multiple builds for a character that you choose from and you path in game to get items for your build Theres tons of items and path choices you can choose from that you can experiment and try new builds Also in gametheres things such as consolesbushesall that so positioning is important Theres also tons of tiny things like foodanimal drops and timersWickelinetrapsswitching gearmastery exp As of right nowthey are currently releasing new characters every 2 weeks or soso youll always have some new variety to play with and experiment with Currently in NAthe ranked queue takes years to find games unless theres an event going on for ittry and find routes that line up with your teammates by zone 3 atleastfind plans that get your weapon by zone 2zone 3 is acceptablesome areas are nearby that might have the same items so if you dont find your itemyou can go there and get itmore people that kill youpaths and items being taken in your pathetc In Squads and Duostheres some leeways like being knocked downhaving 1 or 2 more teammates to revive youteammates can get items for youmore safetyjust everything feels better Ive had so many times where some areas are looted dry and other areas around it are dry as well and it feels so bad But by being in duos or squadsyou can have the safety of your teammates especially if you align your paths you can most likely kill anyone to get their itemsover and over again Adaptability in knowing where items are found in other zones is a huge part of counterplay in this game To methis game feels like a realtime card game where you deckbuild your route with efficient pathing then when ingame you execute your deckplaying around and knowing your opponents meta routes or decks To methinkingOhmy build fails midgame because it item spikes in zone  I should adjust my starting position is the same feeling as thinkingMy deck fails midgame because my mana curve is too stacked in the 5 mana area making my early curve suffer I think Ill adjust it after this matchthe game strives in having a high mastery cap for a single character I can play a character for a hundred games straight and still think to myself after the game that I could improve some parts of my route or my build Just my two centsthis in term is like a deck size Do you want to pick up more lighters in your area for food later onor does your build take too many components early Maybe youll grab that component in the next zone so you can make a bunch of surveillance cameras here Its a series of affordances you constantly have to play around with The games balanced around item power in relation to route efficiency Maybe your build is super greedy and spikes at the third route with four or five gemstones You should adjust the build to take less contested items or know alternative routesThis game has broken my HARD moba addiction I used to play league of legendssmiteheroes of the stormdota 2all the mobas you could ever imagine every dayfor countless hoursconstantly hating myself after every win I was dissatisfied no matter the outcome With winsI was carried by teammateswith lossesI was held back by teammates I was angry But nowwith this gameIm happier then Ive ever been Theres solosduostrioscustomizationa fun mastery system that keeps you engaged throughout the entire gameGonna update this in Decemberthe text below atm is from Mayi noticed this game around February2021it was around for  months at that time It made me curious about its gameplay formula with this MOBABattle Royaleisometric view mix and all those survival aspectscrafting and PvPyou can easily find it on google playstorethe devs diligently release a new char every 2 weekssome skins mixed here and there and do balancebug fixes each weekbut i must do so due to reasons explained belowbi must point out two THE MOST IMPORTANT thingsbtheres absolutely no PaytoWin elements of any kindsb and the only things that matters are your own knowledge and player skill This game is similar to LoL exampleyou play gamesearn account exp and ingame currency and then buy desired characters I will tell more about all methods of obtaining  later in this reviewits exactly as i saidlet me repeat  VERY UNFRIENDLYto the extremebut trust me  the end result and satisfaction from gameplay is worth ittutorial in this game is pretty bad It teaches you the absolute bare minimumbut its not enoughlets look at the first important gameplay aspect in this game  PLANSyou choose the gear that you plan want to build and then decide which route to take The already starts heresince you can choose any zone on the map as your starting point AND you can see HOW MANY enemies also want to start in each zone This means if theres way too many people start at the same zone as you  youl better have a backup plan or two By default youre allowed to have a 5 plans for one character and can increase it further by paying 1500 coins for 1 more Plan slotavoid recommended plans that involves many Legendaryorange itemsthat are required these components to craft Tree of LifeForce CoreMeteoriteVF Blood Those are rare components that youl get from a PvE mob drops very raretimed map events need to know timingsdrop location and be there and prepared to fight Get a basic knowledge of the game firstthen try to go for thosebecause in this game SKILL INFORMATION AND SCALING IS EXTREMELY LIMITING with explanation Often skills got some hollow comments like Slightly increase your movement speed Wtf is

requires Animal Skin item drop Dont try to fight animals other than Chickens without Purple Weaponit will take a lot of time and HPso be aware of enemy in the same zone as youwhen the enemy craft an

lot channel or affiliated streamerswith all the gimmicksfeatureshidden mechanics and etc movesthen you gonna have a good time with the game If you love MOBAs in general or anime themefeel free to check this gameThe eternal in the name stands for the queue timesDefinitely worth a tryId love to see this game blow up2021 Edit The game has improved so much Its getting ever more polished Highly recommend itbut its exactly what I was looking for A single player MOBAeternal queue timeh1Categories that might interest you are underlinedh1while the umovement and combatu is like a less colorful but just as smooth League of Legends with a bulkier UI Impressive considering the usmall game sizeuyou have more time to make decisions or make up for bad ones Or runthat often worksthey have a schedule for specific times of specific days when specific game modes are open uNA serversu seem finebut I havent had issues playing on NA Im sure I havent noticed lag often due to the slow pace of the gamebut Ive also not felt lag at all most of the time My game has frozen due to high ping for a few seconds once every few gamesand on occasion it can take a second longer to open a container18 players also makes the game flow much more appropriate They clearly werent just copying popular stuffbut innovating and adapting to their creative vision Emphasis on creative I do wish it had about 6 more players enough for two more squads and divisible by  for future modes since sometimes you dont find anyone for a whileeven on top of it being a good new MOBA The games flowvariablesadaptive strategies make each one feel very different and I doubt any meta could change that  its in the games coreso even if the last one didnt go well I only see possibilities in the next They overwhelm other aspects of the game that might make you pessimistic in a different MOBAexcept you gather ingredients like a survival game instead of buying them At first I didnt think it mattered muchbut its neat and makes every match refreshing because its freeform instead of restrictiveand enough stuff happens while exploring that it doesnt feel like filler Could have easily just been a gimmick piling onto a dead horse genre You can also already save custom builds in your profilethe weapons dont actually impact much They give you an extra ability in the midgameand characters cant use all weapon types For some reason I thought each character had a ranged and a melee skillset you could swapwhich would appropriately make the game twice as goodbut theyre combinations of several fun characters instead of clones of a single popular oneand their presentation otherwise is mostly very cool Just urlhttpssteamcdnaakamaihdnetsteamapps109590sse6205a8bbab61b963bd2c5e08168652d0bb6c3a1920x1080jpgt1605589look at this gleeful psychotic grinurlI love it And characters often remark on the area around youlike the suitkatana guy talked about how sand is coarse and irritating when I was on the beachwhich is nice Also the guitar girl has breallyb cool sound effectsor skipping action steps like attackmove to attackmoveclick Maybe not praiseworthybut games rarely cover this properlythe ranged ones cant stutterstep effectively and if they try theyll get their legs broken by melee ones when they catch upand if you dont have CC people will just walk away from you While having a udash or stealthu makes survival to late game very easyabout the pace of old LoL playing a few hours every day for a week to earn 1which is currently absurd considering most have already sunk that time in games we can play instead of going through the chore againand that the market has buried most of their competitors who tried to do the same Theyre also transferring new characters very quickly from their previous gameso Im not bothering to keep up However Im happy with every unlockeven suboptimal characters or ones whose style doesnt fit me They do sell a few packaged charactersan insulting offer compared to what Smite gives for that priceyou can only buy charactersand theyre overpriced Which is why Im earning them and not even considering buying However Id like to support EU servers through skinsbut they seem to be focusing on transferring characters from their old gamewhich is probably for the bestIts like league without the constant urge to commit suicidei suck at this game but its funThis game is similar to leagueexcept if it was a battle royale and you had to scavenge for your item components instead of buying them at a shopyou run around finding components and leveling up your character while fighting against other people to be the last one standing Each location also has a limited number of items that you can scavengeso once everyone takes them from a locationthey are gone from that location for the rest of the match AlsoIf you kill or find a body of an opposing player who was killed by someone elseyou can loot them for their wearable equipment as well as any itemscomponents they had in their inventorysuch as gaining one skill point to level up skills per character levelcertain skills that seem very similar to certain league champion skills ex Rozzis Q  Lucians Q  E into one skilland there are neutral monsters laying around that you can kill to gain expthere are also a few differences Firstin addition to skill ranksthere are also mastery skills that are passive skills that give your character additional perks as you level them through a match For examplecrafting items and dealing weapon damage with your weapon will grant exp for your weapon skilland will grant you more damage with your weapon as it levels upyou can build each character as you like tankydpsskill ampetc and are able to change these items during your match as well assuming you can get all the components for them Howevercertain builds may work better for certain characters similar to Leaguethis game is a lot of fun If you enjoy league or battle royale gamesI highly recommend you try this game out Its a easy game to get intobut hard to master Also a lot less toxic than league imoI played the original Black Survival This ones differentbut I like itbut with Battle Royale rulesand scavenging all over it Souhyou can find rocksbranchessome plants and fish to gatherit has a short channel time and a bit of a cooldown that prevents any player from gathering the used up resourceyou have to find parts on the groundin containers around the mapor by hunting animals You have to craft armor itemsweapons and foodtheres animals you can kill that usually drop leathermeatfeathersand sometimes random itemswhile theres no hungertheres health and stamina you can regenerate faster by eating and drinkingit regenerates your life and stamina by sitting down and chillinglike hunting by dealing damage to and killing animalsmovement by walking and exploring etcabilities and statsmaking the playable area smallerbut not for longduo or squadeach character has an affinity for a specific type of weaponryplayers wont try to murder you straight away For the first 13 levels or soa lot of players will either walk past youor back away when they encounter you Kinda nice imonothing more frustrating than dying straight awayyou can plan what gear you wantwhich will also show on the map the most important to visit zonesyou might struggle to find certain itemsor be completely unable to find themso plan out your route and pay attentionunlike in BRs where you progressively lose healthin this game you have 30s timer thats consequence free When timer hits 0you explode and die instantlytheyre phones that are placed in some zonestheyll instantly teleport you to whatever zone you chooseI believe its just Dr Wickeline rnits a fun game with pretty enough graphics Can be hard to learn for new playersas theres a lot of systems and itemsbut tutorials explain everything pretty well and the rest just comes with practice I honestly wish they put some lore into this game from the originalreally liked the journals and Id love some more insight into this worldleague of legends is a trash gamePlayed this game quite a bitenjoyed it a lot back when it first entered early access I also participated in some tournaments and was pretty high rank before the burn out and disappointment hit meyou should know that boiled down to its core this game is an early game speedrun that transitions into a survival game Speedrunning the early portions of the game is a large part of the skill floor of this game and results in the biggest skill gap between players when climbing up to the point where you play against competent players You gather your build together and kill anyone thats behind in tempo Not traditional MOBA combat earlyso be warnedhad a strong difficulty curve and had enough depth to continue making me want to play Thenover timeweird decisions and bad additions to the gameas well as poor balance made the game no longer fun to playas well as being Masters for 3v3s when that mode existed RIP Im very familiar with MOBA games and enjoy them a tonaround 20 minutes at most If you die earlyyou can just queue another game immediatelythoughsee belowbut still has issuesand its done on a consistent scheduleand earning access to all the characters for free is done wellwhich can be rough for new players but feels very nice for those that played beforehand The pacing was much slower previouslyespecially with base move speedresulting in a very snowballed gamebut some people will just walk up to you and attack you and chase youruining the game for both of you You wont diebut youll be behind in tempo and die later anyways because now youre a couple minutes behind in your build This doesnt happen that often in higher rank gamesbut definitely can turn someone off from playing as they learn the game early onthis results in some zones being completely empty of useful mats if enough people do ityoure at a huge advantageand the ping difference is very easy to feel The delay for actions is very noticeablemoreso than other MOBA games like League Ive had ping differences on servers range from 80 ping in one gamethen 100 in the nextboth for Ohio serverswe dont need another layer of complexity Add that they threw a rune system into the game recently and its just needlessly complicating the game The goal should be to smooth the game out and optimize the core so that new players can be comfortable playing and learning the gamethe game is pretty much over for you Many people just suicide if this happens in normal matchesbecause your friends are not gonna have fun sitting there watching you hide from people for 15 minutes You CAN revive your alliesbutglad they changed that Howeverif you arent full build when you dieits pointless to revive because youll come back with much less than everyone else and are essentially dead weight Butits definitely better than it was beforechanging routes for specific characters in order to syncand understanding routing and funneling items in general are all required to playyet are more interesting to newer players because they want to play with their friends This turns off a lot of potential new players from playingbut 3 man teams arent fun Watch the pro team games and see how degenerate matches arebut I think the cons ultimately outweighed the pros for me Definitely give the game a try if you think you could enjoy itbut be prepared to fail a ton before getting good This game is not pick up and play friendlyit takes time and effort to improveand I sincerely hope that others can enjoy it in areas that I could notremove seraphine pleasei would love to really get into this game and try to get good at it but PLEASE we need Australian servers hosted in SydneyThe trick is to forget winning existsand if you get a kill Thats a dubEternal Return is a FREE TO PLAY  unique competitive

1,Wellmy review is mainly for beginners who have just started this game or willing to buy it This is also for them who had stopped playing it after some trivial hours of tryingif you want to get the fullest essence of this game then play with suitable coop partners Some who enjoys solothey may say different but as I played solo because I had none to play withso I felt even boring in some point and so also I felt how much the experience would be better with suitable coop partnersbetter lootor think that while you are reloading your gunyour co op partner still firing and thus you will be less hurt by enemies and the game itself prompts for coop although everything can be done in solo except few achievementsincluding DLCs and need patience to finish them all Howeveras I said beforethis is a hard core game with almost a lot enemy everywheresoat some point you can feel frustrated if you don’t have proper levelled equipment and so you should farm for right things enough Here again comes the advantage of coop such as you 4 people if farm for 4 weapons and then you can make duplicate of those though it is a glitch and you 4 can be well equipped… which chance does not exist in solo and so can be a lot time consuming and monotonous to be advancedas I was when I started this game… may be a problem to understand the architecture of the game At the very beginning the game starts in NORMAL mode Once you will finish the main game… then TVHM True Vault Hunter Mode will be unlocked which you can take as medium difficulty Replaying the game in TVHM mode from the beginning once you reach at level 50 and then so also if you have finished the last mission of main storythen UVHM Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode will be unlocked for you So take this as hard mode There are over power OP 1 to 8 mode also where you can think it as very hard difficulty mode where enemy is up of your level but that can be unlocked once you reach the ultimate level of the gameie level 72 Sothe main game will take you upto the level 50 The UVH pack 1 will take you upto 61 and UVH pack 2 will take you to level 72h1uDO NOT BUY THE BASE BORDERLANDS 2 GAMEuh1the Handsome Collection bundle contains much moremaking the bundle a total savings of more than bi90ibBorderlands 2 is a game for those that enjoy the feeling of finding awesome equipment hidden in a massive pile of other stuffyou dont NEED to go indepth with this game  On the first playthrough you can get by with just picking up gear as you travel alongchoosing stuff that looks better than your current gearand maybe occasionally buying something in the vendor that looks handy  The deeper you go down the rabbit hole howeverthe more there is to discoverand dialogue is often amusing to a degree  Handsome Jackthe main antagonist is a cartoon villain with M rated attitudes  He believesor at least pretends to believe that he is the good guyand you are just a Filthy Banditthe game has a lot more variations in design and color scheme than its predecessor which was brownbrownand a bit of color here and there  Cell shaded graphics with thickgraphic novel like outlines is the style of the gameand does a good job of separating it from the average FPSon to the gameplay itselfyoull find battles where you have to fight hard to win  The game does a decent job of easing you into the various elementssuch as different gun types PistolSMGAssaultCombat RifleShotgunRevolverRocket Launcherand Sniper Riflethe importance of a good shieldgrenade mods alter the way your grenade behavesincluding damage bonuses and special effectsClass Mods Classspecific devices which can boost skillsand have other effects like increasing fire rate with specific weapon typesand lastly Relics Device which generally boost damage or defence in some way  Equipment rarity is also made fairly clear  It goes WhiteGreenBluePurpleMagentaOrangeSeraphand Pearlescent  The final two rarities Pearlescent and Seraph are special  Seraphs require you to have at least one of the season pass DLC to obtain and you need all 4 of the Season Pass DLC to obtain all the Seraph rarity itemsand as to Pearlescent rarity weaponsyou need to be in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode Playthrough  for them to have a chance of being spawned  Dont assume that a blue is automatically better than a green rarity itemeven at the same level  Experimentand two DLC characters  Each class has its ups and downsand a special game changing skill unique to them  For exampleSalvador Gunzerker will dualwield guns when his action skill is activemeaning TWICE THE FIREPOWER  Axton Commando drops a turretwhich damages enemies and draws aggression away from you  Maya Siren locks an enemys movements for a short timeallowing you to get in free hits  Zer0 turns invisible for a few seconds and launches a decoyand his first attack made whilst in this mode does increased damage  The DLC characters are Gaige Mechromancer who launches a flying robot that attacks nearby enemiesand Kreig Psycho a schizophrenic musclebound maniac that will whale on everything within reach with increased offensive and defensive capabilities and can even throw his axe at more distant targetsthere are various other skills that you can put points intoand have an effect on gameplay in some way  For exampleincreasing fire rate or damage for a few seconds after a kill is made  Each character has  skill treeseach ending with a final gamechanging skill modifier  For exampleZer0s Bloodlust Melee tree ends with the Many Must Fall perkwhich will instantly redeploy the hologram if he kills the enemy with one melee strike  As mentioned beforeClass Mods unique to a character class will boost certain skills  Its possible for them to go as high as 6meaning some skills can be boosted to 11as the normal limit on points you can put into most skills is 5though some skills are only 1 those usually affect the way you playthere is a gun that shoots swordsEXPLODING swordsIn DLC4 Tiny Tinas Assault on the Dragon Keep  So yeahthere is that tooeven if it might be a bit messy XDDefinitely one of the best new games I have played This game is fun to play solo or over the net with friends The characters are wittyyeah even Claptrap  Graphics are beautiful Even after playing this game over 000 hours the game gives wowmoments to me And every time theres something new and the vast choice of weaponsshields and other gadgets So I fullheartedly recommend Borderlands 2 And yesI will play coop with you After some extensive testingI have come to the conclusion that Borderlands 2 is a very good game It can keep you amused forumquite a whileEdit 1 20170801 Please stop joining my gamemy anxiety cant handle itbeing my number one favourite I couldnt think of a way to make it unbiased But after the resurgence of Open world gamesthe downfall of AAA and the battle between TF2 and OverwatchI think I can finally pinpoint what makes it so beautifulits filled with colour and despite being cartoony it feels more realistic than the grim grisley greyness of SkyrimMorrowindWitcher etc Its not perfect of coursewith clipping and terrible lip sync but with the cartoony atmosphere it adds to the exaggerated charm that it providesthe way it has been presented is genius There are a lot of gay charactersblack charactersfemale characters but these characteristics do not define who they are The characters still have peronalitiesthey just happen to be these things they are not just addonsit just adds to the depth of the worldand this Borderlands nails too A lot of games cant tell whether they want to be simple or complicatedthey cant tell what gimmicks they want to useso they use everything and it turns into an incoherent mess urlhttpsteamcommunitycomiddarkregin2recommended91540like Undertaleurl Borderlands knows exactly what it wants to do Its a Single Player or CoOp FPS with RPG mechanics with levelling and loot systems The RPG mechanics make it feel more open worldy than most open world games It defines what towns existand gives you fast ways to get to themand while games like Skyrim use the open world idea to make you travel for hoursBorderlands 2 just adds a lot of depth with secret loot boxesexperienceCult of the Vault logos or mini easter eggsthe entirety of Southern Shelf You fight Knuckle draggerto a new player they find out how brilliantly designed the bosses will be They arent walls of healththey arent stupidly damagingthey are balanced with weaknesses and phases An expert player on the other hand could then debate whether they would want to farm Knuckle Dragger for the legendary pistol Hornetor just move on This can also be seen in Southern Shelf Bay when you have to kill Midgemong A new player could rush right towards Midgemong or maybe explore the boatswhile an expert player would take the long route around for some extra loot and instead of calling the bridge over to get across the lakethey can just run across the chainsignificantly increasing the pacing and replayability of the gamethe majority of the fun is in the UVHM playthrough which is a DLC The bugs might throw people off while I enjoy discovering two or three new ones every new playthrough Even despite thisjust the first playthrough with a friend is highly worth your time Lets hope Borderlands  will be another great one Iron out the issues of Borderlands 2while still being able to provide replayability where Borderlands The Presequel couldnth1Borderlands 2  Excellent StorySolid GameplayGreat Characters and one of the very best Coop experiences aroundh1it may not initially impress some used to a next generationhigh definitionultra realistic landscapebut it is nevertheless very appealing and detailed Some of the landscapes and views around Pandora the world on which the story takes place are beautiful and each area has its own look and atmosphere Characters and enemies are detailed and extremely varied in appearance You can customise your characters appearance with a large selection of outfits and heads which you can collect throughout the gametdjust really good atmospheric music throughout Where this game really shines is the voice acting for charactersenemiesaudio logs and even weapons yes some of them can talk The dialogue is often very funnyhelping to explain and drive the storyfill in background and really adds the the immersiontdBorderlands 2 is a lot of fun to play So many missions to completeso many enemies to killso much loot to grab You are given massive areas to explore all over the world of pandora filled with creaturesquestssecrets and homages to lots of popular culture Controls are responsiveintuitive and the game mechanics even at higher difficulties feel fair and well thought through As you progress through the game you will earn xp and levels which allow you to customise your characters skills giving a large variety of gameplay stylestdand while the main story is fairly linearthe open world nature of the game allows you to take a break from the main story arc and explorer the hundreds of characters and side missions that can be found all over Pandora It also has one of the most badasscharasmatic and handsome villians of all time tdtrue vault hunter and ultimate vault hunter with progressively better rewards There is so much detail in the story and so many optional missions that each play through feels different Next you have at least 4 more with DLC characters each with their own skillsplaystyle and story to explore Finally you have tons of loot in the form of GunsShieldsGrenadesRelics and Class Mods you can collect for your character These increase in rarity from white basic to orange legendary generally the rarer the weapon the more damage it will do and many will have additional unique abilities red text tdthis game remains simply the best cooperative multiplayer experiences you can have Your characters skills really augment and compliment each other when playing as a team Enemy and mission difficulty automatically adjusts to the amount of playersrequiring real teamwork and synergy to avoid dying at higher levels The multiplayer allows you to connect drop in and out midgame to your steam friends games or to public gamesconnections for the most part feel quick and responsive even with 4 players and with only a small delay on audio communication tdwhile a minority of missions feel like you are just a glorified delivery boymost are creativefunny and packed full of classic moments and great characters So much fun to pick up and play with friends  I havent really mentioned the DLC of which there is a lot in this review but the main ones Mr TorguesCaptain Scarlett and especially Tiny Tinas are all well worth getting these are included in the Game of the Year editiongreat fun to play and add loads more content to the game To progress to the highest level in the game level 72 overpower levels you will also need the ultimate vault hunter pack 2 so I would recommend that if you reach the end and still want more tdThere is something to be said for a game that I just dont get sick of I have owned this on console and played through TVHM at least 4 times with 4 different characters there Played all the DLC except Tiny Tina on consolebut when the GOTY edition became so cheap on PC I jumped at it and bought all the Headhunter DLCsand the Ultimate Vault Hunter Pack as well So I can now play through the game THREE times on a character Darbut the funny thing is that I dont even finish itor even come close to it now Im in a mass addiction to boosting my Badass Ranks so I just keep trying to prestige it instead of moving on and going towards UVHM xDand then quit playing Unfortunatelyfor me anywaysI dont do that I keep playing for hoursand I let all the other hundreds of games in my library continue to pile upand truly it can bebut dont disregard this game as a single player game It is insanely addictiveand it actually poses some slight challenges to you to play it solo Beating Raid Bosses solo is actually a genuine accomplishmentif you can actually do it They are meant to be beaten witha 4 player teambut you CAN beat many of them solo The new Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode UVHM makes it an even more insane challenge to play solo just for the regular game enemies Needing to pump them full of slag just so you can actually get ready to start damaging them with any real power Of course all this is basically a math problem of damage output vs damage defensesimply putis one of the best games ever made in my opinion The sheer addictiveness and fun in playing it are jsut off the charts I recommend this to anyoneeven if you think you wont like it I thought Borderlands 1 looked stupid for years until I bought it for 5 with everything and realized how amzing the concept is and how it was made for OCD gamers Now they are both 2 of my most played games everand I dont see myself stopping BL2 anytime soon After all I ahvent even used The Psycho yetUVH Packand allt he Headhunter DLCs for less than 20 BTWthese DLCs are legit and worth buying This isnt some garbage map pack DLCor jsut skins These are high quality and large DLCs on the scale of the FAllout DLCsand add even more than that in some of tehm GOTY edition has almost too much content Better than Borderlands This game is infinite You can play it whatever you like and its always fun Ive said enoughBetter than Borderlands  tbhI had played 1200 hours before I even tried any of the DLC Nowif that doesnt speak to the incredible level of fun and depth that this game bringswellI just dont know that anything canhelping the pooror working on my home But not oftenNice gunplay CheckA psycho came running to me screamingMy wife left meTrick your friend into dropping their gun so you can take it simulatorPlayed pirated copy since the initial release when I was a kid Started my career and bought everything and

0,TarkovIN SPAAAAAACE But seriously it does seem like a more casual Tarkov experience that is pretty damn fun I have high hopes for this gamebecause this is just the betaVery funhope they keep beta open permanentlyStreamlined Tarkovmore arcadey and fluid Wouldnt say better combat but for me its funner in The Cycle Also lots of quality of life features you almost instantly enter a matchno base inventory juggling for 1015 mins between a matchautomatic turn insno bags in bags in bags nonsensedont need 3 screens to feel optimaleasy to understand objectives and items that lets me focus on the things I likewhich is lootingexploringstalkingfighting and getting the hell out This is fun and solid for a closed betaespecially compared to some more recent betas heh If the game is this good nowI bet its gonna be a banger when it releases next year300 hours in cycle on epic launcherYeah no Old one was definitely a better choiceSpace Tarkovand or if there will be a wipe system I am also excited for more loot collections as they add more content and stuff to loot There are aliens in game that are the equivalent to scavs in Tarkov that terrorize the players as you try to loot The more hardermore mobs there are in that areathe more lootbut it feels like the servers is worse than CSs and Rust hitreg Spawning is currently broken where I have had people spawn inside of me before ive even deployed hopefully a fix soonthey should be developing and focusing on making this game fire I am only scared of this because they have already implemented a tiered battle pass which is never a good sign right off the bat If its ftp then that makes sense bc how else would they make money but Im sick of all these games coming out with a battle passTarkovin Spacewith monsters Thats what i heardto be able to use their high power gunsthere you goI really want to like this game  Its got an interesting settingbeautiful worldgreat soundtracktakes a lot of inspiration from Tarkovand definitely has a lot of potentialthe combat leaves far too much to be desired for this to warrant any serious time investment  Theres simply nothing to master  the systems are far too basic  Weapons feel terriblebullets go nowhere near where youre aimingmovement is a chore and the stamina mechanic simply pads out the time it takes to move from point A to B  I understand Tarkov was a big inspirationbut a stamina bar just doesnt work if the rest of the game is so arcadey and basiclack of depthand its missing a LOT of QOL features for a beta  I dont know much about the dev cycle of this gamebut this definitely still feels like an early alpha to me  There just isnt enough meat on the bones to consider the hook of the game worthwhile at all  For this to compete in the FPS marketthe combat  movement need a TON of work  I refuse to play Tarkov because of how janky and clunky it feelsand unfortunately this feels just as badbut the systems are 110th as deep  Will check back in 6 months or a year and see where its atBreath of fresh air after tarkovs china level pollutionI played dozen of hours of the original The Cyle that was present on the EGSI stopped playing when I had to bring my pc to do an hardware reset and I decided to have only 1 launcher on my machineI applied for getting the alpha access so I could play again with randoms using the good ol komradbibg momma combobut when I got the access and installed it I found out that the game was veryveryvery different than it once wasThe Cycle has become a ripoff of Escape from Tarkovand a pretty bad at that The game became slow and sluggishgone are the suits that gave you access to different mobility optionsthe weapons went from an unlockable to your account to a weapon that you can potentially loose forever in a bad runammo are now limited and scarse in the low games that I playedalongside with many other problems that I do not care to find out because the game just bored me to deathif shipped like thisis gonna be dead on arrival If the dev team wants to have a chance to get some players they really need to go back to the formula they first hadaka mobile pvepvpmission based battle royalbut reworking the materials mechanicsadding either cosmetic stuff to crafta base to build or a guild to work towardsor even periodic events where the top playersguilds that gave the most materials would get a reward maybe having the top 3 guild banners in the lobby of every game I dunno This would even fit better with the whole setting than what we have nowpray and wait that the game will get rollbacked andif that happenshope that I havent bought my Komrad yetRelatively well polished and put together for a closed betawith some innovative additions and design changes Overall I 100 recommend for anyone interested in this type of gameI see a bright future for The Cycle The gunplay and overall combat feels very clean and responsiveIve found mixing SoloDuoTrio queues in this game to be relatively problematicgiven the somewhat high time to killand features that make team play easysuch as seeing your team members through walls and with an outline this is not an issue in Tarkov as there is no reliable way to differentiate friend from foeand the time to kill is so fast a solo player can easily catch a 5 man squad off guard and destroy them Howeverin Cycleif a solo player turns a corner and there are two enemies thereeven with superior aim and reflexes it is unlikely he will be able to kill both of them before he dies assuming all players have relatively equal equipmentthe default tier of backpack and even the first craftable tier green do not allow for many items to be carried I believe players who want to risk staying in a match longer or fighting more playersshould be able to effectively benefit from this choice by carrying out more loot As it standsit is most efficient from a value acquisition standpointto enter a match and fill your bag up within 100 minutes and just leavegiven that there are no quests from what I have experienced that require you to directly kill other playersand that the value to weight ratio of player loadouts is inefficient to carry I would love to see the game add decent rewards for players who prefer to hunt other players appose to completing all of the PvE and gather questsbut these are the primary problems I encountered regarding system and design decisions Overall I believe The Cycle is a great game that fills a gap in the shooter market that was previously not catered to I am optimistic about the games future moving forwardBased on the time I have spent in The Cycles Discord serverand the brief correspondence I have had with members working on the gamethe team comes off as capablecaringpassionateand most importantly receptive to feedback A huge  for the gameLost all the individuality of the original and somehow runs worse than it used toBeta has been thrillingfiguring out monstershow to beg people for your lifeand crouching for 30 yards because you thought you heard something behind you The blend of PvPvE is done wellaudio plays such a large part of what youre doing and where youre going Cool few maps already to check out and a quite a few gunsmaterialsand things to upgraderesearch that seem promising Cant wait to see morehow the gamecommunity growsand how they handle it allGoodYo This recommendation is after just 6 hours in the gameand let me tell you I am getting more and more addicted to this game DApex LegendsHunt Showdown or maybe a breed of them all into one Then this is the game for youthat this game has the most potential and highest quality of ANY closed beta or early access game I have seen EVER It can even compare to early access and several published games in terms of performancefeaturesserverscontent and the execution of the content Sure it needs some polish to really shine like the Sunbut so far it already does an exellent job of blinding me I can recommend this game for those lads and lassies as well yes Not the same as Tarkovbut similar enough to be comparabletheres no flea marketmeaning each raid has real value and a lot of it compared to Tarkov  thus keeping the economy strongkeeping the game in a similar state to early wipe Tarkov for much longerallowing newer players an easier and more fun time playingwhilst rewarding and still challenging higher tier playerstheres literally 0 waiting time when wanting to get into a match Click ready and youre inthe second or two of black screen all depends on how fast your SSDHDD ismaking it much less infuriating when you die as you dont feel like youve wasted 0 minutes just to get killed in the first theres not too much bad about this game Provided content will be added in the future the only thing I could complain about is the small variety of monsters and how weapons scale to make them a pretty much noneexistent threata great game for when released    its simular to escapefrom tarkov     id recomend playing the game if your decent with shooter games  with a little luck and lots of aim youl enjoy a high risk reward enviroment for upon death you lose your gear  and theres always an unexpected thing around the corner so check your six when entering areasits a lot like the original cycle game but it has a lot of improvements and I would definitely recommend over the old cycleSuper soild beta had alot of funReally enjoyed the betaill be playing it as soon as it launches
1,The genre that mostly began with Cookie Clicker reaches its logical conclusionlootboxesseason passesfancy graphics and contrived plotlines when you can cut out the middleman and simply watch NUMBERS GO UPbut quickly increases the way all of these numbers interact with each other While the main goal of increasing numbers remains the samethe player will quickly have to learn the best way to manage At first glance the new player may be overwhelmedbut those who have a predilection for numbers and how they interact will have a ton of fun figuring it all outyoull uncover the main storyline if youre into that kind of thing and progress from zone to zone finding better and better gear Youll unlock the ability to enhance your stats through advanced training and augmentation before you take on your first TITANone of the true bosses of the game Defeating these titans unlocks even more ways your numbers can interact with each other These are best left discovered by the playerbut rest assured you wont be disappointed as you watch your numbers climb into the stratosphereyoull find help is easy to come by when you have a question about how a mechanic works or what to emphasize nextPlayed it for a few hoursnice gameIve been playing for a little bit Its alrightsomewhat preferable to deathLook This game has no delusions of grandeur that other idle games seem to have with their ad campaignscrossover eventsand what have you NGU Idle knows exactly what it is Youre here to watch Numbers Go Up Youre here to click a thing sometimes to make the Numbers Go Up faster You get more Numbers that make the other Numbers Go Up faster then you make ithosei Numbers Go Uptheres certainly Numbers And they Go UpIve played A LOT of idle games in my timelet me tell you Ive been around the blockIve tasted all the flavorsyou can rest assured when I say I know my stuff And this game This idle game right here Oh man This is EXQUISITE idle game content Its astounding to me how well a single dev can nail down a concept like thisthats been done to death alreadyand in such a way that surpasses all its predecessors in magnificent form 11  A HEARTIEST RECOMMENDATIONSIf only you could see my hours on this game from kongBeen playing this for only awhile and its pretty goodWake upI like the part where the numbers go upI decided that before I hit 1k hours I should make a review for this game Its enjoyableand long Be cool like me and give the next year of your life to NGU idle Youll only slightly regret itNumbers go upGordon Ramsay goes downseeds go PFWOOMbeards get longgame gets consistently more ridiculous until it collapses into itself like some kind of MSPaint horrorshow designed in an adjacent timeline where nobody has a real face and everything is always on fireThis game is probably the sole reason why i havent shut pc off for basically a yearIve played the game a few minutes Its quite possibly the best idle game ever creatednumber go up weeeePRELIMINARY REVIEW I DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH PROGRESS FOR A FULL REVIEWMIDLATE GAME CURRENTLY4G aka Somethinggggnot to be confused with the Clicker Games genre  Why That will be explained belowas in any idle gameconsists of doing something and then idling for most of the time This can be shaken up by voluntary challenges which give special rewards or just general improvmentsbut make sense to progress faster The challenges require you to reach a certain progress at allwithin 24 hourswith some features disabledetcthere is a progression with unlocks every now and then The new features contribute to the gameplaythey give additional bonuses if you explore thembut you idle them as well as you do with most other thingswhich you use to train yourself and progress by beating Bossesthen reset to make the training cost modifiers go down so you can train faster Very early you unlock magicwhich unlocks additional trainingthe same loop applies During this time you rebirth every hour optimallybut also provides adventure stat bonusesbonuses for other mechanicsand even the legendary cooking mechanic With the drops of equipmentyou also collect boosts that can enhance your equipmentor an infinity cubewhich is actually giving you 1 percent of the boost as a permanent bonusup to a soft cap that is determined by your basic statisticsthe main one is spending experience which you get from beating bossesbut later better by other means which would be a spoiler So as you get strongerbeat more bossesprogress through the gamenew features unlock The NGU is a feature that is titular and allows you to permanently increase your statistics in multiple areasincluding how fast the NGU itself goes  the Energy NGU can boost Magic NGUand Magic NGU can boost Energy NGUbut the softcap makes a target that can be reached within minutes at full speed Realistically you will need some dayshoweverbut feel that progress improves As you grow stronger and power up your energy and magic as well as increase its capyou can progress faster through the NGU levelsmore permanent bonuses can be unlocked by various means The first real main objective is to beat boss 31and on the way there you unlock most features Then you can start the next difficulty where more features can be unlockedsome old features offer new permanent rewardsbut everything takes longer to progress Working your way up therethe same gameplay loop of getting stronger just by playing appliesmaking the game one to run in the background  or thanks to newer patches just quit after it autosavedand some are pretty much required for your sanity What sounds horrible at first actually is very fairas you earn the premium currency just by playing dailylater there are even other features that give you a steady stream of it Where buying something new takes weeks at firstlater you can buy something every few days This isobviouslywithout investing real money In factbuying premium currency with real money actually might diminish the fun as it makes you progress a bit faster than intended Howeverif you want to support the developerin my opinion the Name in Game pack is the best ideaalthough expensive You get then added to a list of enemies in one feature of the game You automatically kill thembut apart from the namethey are just normal enemies that drop a reward used for that featurebecause I asked if I can NoI MUST recommend this game Although I have not even 7 hours in and due to some mistakes I made progressed too slow in some partsI tremendously enjoy the game Grantedmost of the time was just letting the game run in the background But that is what idle games are for They dont demand muchexcept one that deliberately is unfair but still funno purchase is necessaryso you have to make sometimes tactical and often strategical decisionswhich are encouraged to use by giving daily free premium currencyso you gain more rewards if you play longerkeeping up with the gameplayadds new features every now and then which you can unlockbut that is what keeps the motivation going even after a year of playingmaxing them gives bonusessome ingame achievements are also Steam achievementsalthough you will not want to switch to a lower one when you can handle the higher one except for finishing the rest of the challenges there or for getting strong enough at first to tackle the higher oneonly later you can check the game once or twice a day to get the daily rewardsand one premium itemthe advanced loot filteris absolutely necessary for your sanitythe wiki helpsand you gain permanent bonuses by rebirthing with the right features unlockedyou love NGU IdlenumberThis is a low quality game and massive waste of time  in all the best ways I have played every day for well over a year and I cant imagine stoppingThis game looks like a school project but Ive played for 6 hoursIve become addicted to numbers and Im being held hostage please helpIf you value your spare time dont get this game
1,As an old guy who is new to online FPS this game is very tough It is on the realistic side  One shot will usually kill you or the enemy   Artillery and tank fire is devastating   I died  at least 20 times before I even saw my first enemy   I finally fired my gun after about two hours of playing   And it took me about 4 hours of playing before I actually killed an enemy  I appreciate it is difficult  It makes any success I have more rewarding  The game looks fantastic and it plays very well  I am sure if you have any FPS online experience it will go easier for you  Newbies should take baby steps and have patience  Spend a lot of time being a grunt infantryman  Learn the game until you move on to other jobs  I have joined empty servers just to practice throwing grenades   I have 5 hours playing and I am still learning the game and playing as a basic infantryman   It is a very entertaining game  But be prepared to die a lot and you must have patience to learnA detailed HLL reviewoverview UPDATE 0its less hardcore than a game such as Post Scriptum and therefore is enjoyable for casual gamers but is challenging enough to satisfy Hardcore playersthis means running with your squadlistening to your Squad Leader and communicating oftenlone wolfs generally have a lower overall score than someone who plays with his squadkills do not count for many points but are satisfying nonethelessespecially the tink sound of headshotscommunication wins games and you dont want to be having to stop every 0 seconds to type somethingthey are the static point at which your entire team can spawn atthey require a Squad Leader and a support player to buildthe support drops supplies and the SL builds the garrithis is a mini garrison that only your squad can deploy onArmourRecon or Commanderthey push the objectivesprotect your tanks and cap points while also defending positions while other squads attack the point You are awarded points when you are in enemy and friendly territory so staying back and defending captured positions nets you just as much points as attacking while also allowing you to have the defenders advantage of the enemy pushing right infront of your gunyou play as a 3 man squad DriverGunner and Spotter it is your task to eliminate enemy tanks and support the infantryit is adrenaline filled fun and hugely excitingit is your responsibility to keep your frontal armor facing the enemybut it also takes skill and patience to place a shot from 700m and hit the right spot to do the most damageespecially if you are outgunned by a heavier tankthis position is very importantyou have a periscope which enables you to see the enemy from long rangesthis means you may be telling your gunner to shoot somewhere so far away heshe cannot see the target and are relying on you to use the marking system called pinging to see targets The driver also relies on you to help find a path through the countryside because he only has a small window slit to see throughso againcommunication is keyLuchs light tankarmed with 20mm autocannon Panther medium tank very mobile but hard hitting medium tank with a 75mm gun and the Heavy Tiger tank slow and methodical beast with its massive 88mm gunStuart Light tank 37mm the 75mm and 76mm Sherman JumbosBA0 recon carT3476 and IS Heavy tankSoviet or a 8x scope Germans While there is a massive difference in zoom between the two scopesthe smaller zoom on the AmericanSoviet rifle allows for quicker and more aggressive up close play 00m250m while the german scope is cumbersome therefore encourages you to finding a nice position and picking the enemy off from 250m500m Recon is responsible for either helping your team push by taking out high value targets such as MGsofficers or other Recon Squads but can also slip behind the lines and destroy enemy garrisons and resource nodes more on those laterrecon can place theirs anywhere which enables deep flanks and stealth missionsyour 6 man squad is relying on you to make informed and quick decisions on a tactical levelie Do you move to the exposed flank and hold it from a vantage point such as a farmhouse and prevent the enemy from streaming throughor do you be more aggressive and try to flank yourself while having to worry about your comrades being hit from that exposed flankpatience and also making snap decisions as well as taking advice from other squad members Your main role is to push the points with your squadflank the enemymark enemy movement on the mapbuild garrisons to support the push and communicate with other SLs and the Commander constantlyall while under fire and trying to figure out where the enemy aresome prefer to get down and dirty building defensive or offensive garrisons and being closer to the front linewhereas others prefer to sit further back and direct traffic from their map more like an RTS game and micromanageand the only way to acquire them is for SLs to have 2 members of their squad support for the suppliesand an engineer to build build  nodesthese consist of munitionsmanpower and fuelgarrisons or just to fortify a chosen area engineers can build bunkers etc with suppliesantitank can build ATguns Manpower enables the Commander to use specific offensivedefensive abilities while fuel allows the Commander to spawn in tanksand recon vehiclesif the Commander has no resources because players have not built nodes they cannot do these thingsand as anyone who has played an RTS knowsNo resources no winbecause it is much more nuanced and does require you to be a stingy buggeryou need to make hard decisions and prepare to take the blame if it back fires in your faceand focus on the greater strategical picture My advice is to be firm but not a tyrantevery SL will be telling you we need supplies here or we need a bombing run hereit is up to you to decide whether they actually need those things or if they could be better put to good use and send them another squad to help out insteadit is 00 worth it and the community Australian at least is very welcoming and helpfulPlease go into the Options  Gameplay and max the slider onYou spawn at the end of the map and have to run 5 minutes straight towards the enemy linesbecause your spawn points got overrun by an enemy tankjust to get a headshot from god knows wherekilling your allies left and righta balanced gaming experience or cool ranks to show off withhoping that they dont spot you while an enemy tank rolls next to the dead tree you and your buddys lay behindlet them get past and start firing which makes for a surprising and chaotic fight in the middle of nowherebut that makes them feel 0 times better and you will remember these moments because they have more impactnothing feels more rewarding than pulling of a successful maneuver the other team did not expect and rushing their last base in the cover of your tanks while your allies beside you scream out their victoryMy very first game on HLL I join a serverselect the Alliesenter an open squad yesthey can be locked and select a machinegunner As soon as the match begins the squads officer asks via voip if there are any new players I answer meask him and my other squaddies to forgive me if I make mistakesand the squad leader just laughs it off and tells me no worriesjust follow my directionskeep your eyes sharp and your ears sharper and youll do fine And thenwe start moving towards a quaint French town called Carentanthe squad leader tells us Our orders are to occupy it and defend the area no matter the costs Watch out for windows and rubble because therell be Krauts everywhere And there WERE lots of Krauts in the area I run forward in the open like a headless chickenand a German rifleman shoots me in the torso I crumple to the groundas the noises all around me grow duller and duller and my vision starts to blur as life abandons methe squads medic shouts So I waitwhile the medic tosses a smoke grenade to conceal his movementsreaches my dying frame and brings me back to the realm of the living with a quick morphine shot Now dive for cover Go behind those barrels over therehe tells mewhich I eagerly dostill bleeding out Once behind coverthe medic pulls out the bandages and starts to apply a field dressingwhile the squad leader checks the surroundings with his binocularsdamn itand before I ask him exactly which windowhe points me a specific one in the distance I squint my eyes as hard as I canand notice that there are indeed a couple of indistinct shapes looking at us I then deploy my mighty M99 heavy machinegunignoring the gunshots that plink all around meand start laying down a withering hail of suppressive fire against that and nearby windows I doubted I ever got a single krautbut that wasnt what mattered  what mattered was that the jerries had no way of peeking out of those windows without getting mulched With me supporting their advancethe remainder of my squad moves towards the building under the cover of smoke grenadeswhile our riflemen toss as many grenades inside the windows as they can I hear gunshots coming from the buildingsa couple of players curse as they get downed while the squad leader shouts Ive got emIve got em Come here gunnerwe need your mgnot aiming at anybody in particular but still managing to hit me  again  and cause me to bleed NeverthelessI manage to get inside the building and get the medic to patch me up again This is becoming a habitmate I should start to charge you for every dressinghe jokes We both laughat least until a kraut tosses a grenade inside a nearby windowsomething the medic does not notice Grenade right behind you RunI yell at him We both run as far away from that room as possible right as the grenade goes offI emerge unscathed from the blast but the medic is hit and starts bleeding Cover me while I patch myself uphe asks mebut right at that moment one of our squaddies who was garrisoning the buildings ground floor yells OH sttheyre insi before an SMG burst causes him to scream Realizing that theres only one way up the building and that I am right in front of the stairsI lay on the ground and deploy my machinegun yet again A kraut climbs the stairs and runs right in front of my machinegungetting riddled with bullets and falling on the spot Two more krauts enter after himboth of which get similarly cut down while I yell theyre coming Right up the stairs A friendly rifleman arrivestosses a couple of grenades down the stairsand I see torn human limbs flying everywhere Germsre sanitizedhe shouts back The squad leader laughs it offcongratulates us bothand then orders us to keep marching towards the church at the center of Carentan Its only 00 meters away from our positionbut due to a german Tiger parked right in front of it and at least two German platoonsit might as well be miles and miles awayand the germans are the ones desperately scrambling away from that hulk of steel on tracksfalling back inside the church Around the churchartillery fire starts falling on the battlefield like raintearing to pieces any soldier unfortunate enough to get hit Undauntedour assault specialist throws a couple of smoke grenades before getting cut down by submachinegun fire His heroic sacrifice allows us to enter inside the church in relative safety and engage the last kraut holdouts in a desperate close quarters battle they are hopelessly outmatched for due to their boltaction rifles and the elevated number of automatic and semiautomatic firearms we possessthe church of Carentan has fallen into Allied handsbut we do not even have the time to pat on each others shoulders that a massive artillerly barrage rains all around the church Allied soldiers who arent quick or lucky enough to get inside are pulverized by the concentrated explosive firethe sherman that was covering us gets blown to smithereensand all thats left to defend the capture point is our 5men squad and a rifleman from another platoon who somehow made it to the church by the skin of his teethour squad leader orders us We dash for the churchs bell tower like madmenwhile the rifleman straggler tosses a couple of grenades to cover our retreat Finally at the top of the bell towerI realize that it is spacious enough to give us ample room for manoeuversgives us a very nice overlook of the entire townand has only one way in or out Defend the bell tower at all costsGddammitI hear the squad leader scream ThusI pick a spot with a clean line of sight to the stairs and deploy my trusty machinegun againin unorganized waves that get mercilessly scythed down at firstand in coordinated attacks with grenadessmoke grenades and submachinegunners later Me and the straggler get shot againbut the medic in our team quickly bandages up again It is only in that moment that I realise my machinegun is completely out of ammo Out of ammoI yell to my squaddieswhich prompts the straggler to drop an ammo box right next to me Thanking himI proceed to restock while the Germans keep on assaulting our position The situation grows more and more desperate untilat long lastit happensthree whole platoons of soldiers supporter by a Sherman Jumbo Realising that they have been beatenthe krauts cease their attempts to storm the bell tower and focus on the attackers It is at that moment that our squad leader orders us on the offensive With the desperation that only a cornered animal can musterwe toss the very last two grenades we have down the stairway and catch the german defenders in a devastating pincer attack The church of Carentan is now ours once againfor real this time The squad leader congratulates us allme in particular You did very well for a first timermate  he tells me  now try to keep it up with the two remaining capture points Lets goGraphicsHave you ever seen your friends get split in half by an artillery shell Please scroll down to EDIT 3Hell Let Loose does everything rightyou wont have 30 minute breaks between fighting and wont have to wait 5 minutes after the match starts to fight The maps are large enoughbut their design encourages players to get into the action quicklywhile still retaining a very important tactical meta That meta doesnt just include field tactics such as flankingdefendingfinding superior firing positionsetcbut also a Commander role which leads your team and has the power to call supply dropsstrafing runsand bombing runsand playercontrolled artillery guns can wreak havoc on enemy positions The experience of being an infantryman while tactically pushing forward alongside armor and a platoons worth of soldierswhile being hailed with artillery and enemy small arms fireis really a sight to seeFOR FREE No MTXno lootboxesyou can only earn these items by playing the gameand some are quite large more is being released within the next few weeksand they stated they have 3 additional maps in the current development pipeline community believes at least one of these is Carentan edit I think its more like 0 or  maps at this pointwith plenty more on the waywhich is exactly what is happening The current audio for weapons and animations for weaponsmovement are being upgraded significantly at the momentand this update will be pushed to player clients within the next few monthsthis game might be for you It doesnt exactly play like BFit isnt quite a sandbox And you really really need to work with your team Having a mic is preferablebut most leaders ingame will be OK with your presence as long as you can understandfollow orders and occasionally type in the chatand its already shining quite a bit IMOand I believe the release product will be truly amazingslightly higher than default FOVand two settings on Medium  I think one is Shadows and I forget the other FXtextures are definitely kept maxed Also using FXAA And setting corpse despawn to lowest possibledrops to 4045 with heavy actionlots of players Pretty playableits not like a twitch reaction shooter like CoD that oftenthough I still would like a better processor But due to Intels annoying socket release Im stuck with this until I get a fully new PCthings have faltered slightly Since I last updated this reviewthe devs have added MTX al beit just a few and a console version Pacing of updates has slowed down as welland the game suffers from long periods of imbalance in which everyone including the devs agree certain features arent working wellbut they refuse to diverge from their once every 4 to 5 months patch schedulelows of 5060 and highs of 0020 Certainly not awfulbut given the games mediocre visual fidelity and the potential of this hardwareits not great I should note my GPU usage almost never goes about 70usually hovering between 40  60  its clear that the devs have not considered or cared to give higher quality graphics options for those of us with capable hardware the devs are apparently going by the Steam Hardware Surveywhich is totally inaccurate when compared to HLL players  a reddit poll found that 55 of HLL players have RTX cardsbut there are rough edges that will likely never be sorted out HLL is an indie game that likes to pretend its AAAbut its far from itNot knowing who shot youwhere fromor what with No health barno radarno silly pop up turrets or calling in helicopter gun ships No forcefields or shields And no idea how many bullets left in your clip assuming you had one The suppression of being pinned by machine gunsnot being able to swim and fear of what lies behind every wallhedgerows for cover and learn to count the bullets If you cant see who is making the foot stepsjust start shootingyou run for 3 km and then get shot by a guy you never see 0played new soviet mapsI dont often review games because I am lazybut this game deserves it I am a 32 year old gamer and my fps experience goes back to Doom I played all the FPS games A few of the codsall the counter stirkesmost the battlefieldstribesunrealsquakestitanfallsrainbow six etc This game is different then them all Team work isnt wanted its absolutely needed There is no kill feedno glamour for the solo person with 50 kills at the end you just get to celebrate the win while your countries music plays on the score tab Its a veryvery different game I am not super familiar with this genre having only played ARMA 3 for a few hours but the people playing this game are passionate A lot of them take everything super serious which has its ups and downs but mostly ups The player base is small enough you start to see the same people in gamesbut its large enough its always possible to find a full server to play on in less than 5 minutes There is so many niches to fill in this game I suggest watching a youtube video before loading it up The strats you need to win in this game take a lot of team coordination average game has around 0 diff squads all geared towards diff tactics to help you win Im semi drunk and rambling but I really enjoy this gameyes there are times where you are getting crushed and you basically spawn inrun for 5 mins and die but those are few and far between After a few games you get the hang of it start your own squad so you can have some control on where to place down spawn points Who knowsmaybe someday youll have the balls to lead the entire 50 person team as commanderShowed this to my German grandpa and he started telling me where the best camping spots wereWhatever you dodont play it like its call of dutyHell Let Loose lies at an excellent intersection between BattlefieldSquad and Insurgency It brings the scale of the formerthe logistics and teamwork of the middle and immediacy of the latter to impress with its 50 vs 50 WW2 battles that teeter between bombastic chaos and matteroffact single shot kills Having just two modes  a 90 minute Warfare mode with single objective conquestand the staggered 30 minute Offensive mode where a frontline is gradually and permanently pushed back by attackers restricting loadout customisation to two or three presets and no allowance for custom rules might seem overly strict or boring to somebut really it allows the game to enjoy an unusual focus foRr a genre thats by now bogged down in noise and lack of polish HLLs ambition is to push you into almost a slice of life style of storytellingwhere each individual is but a small cog in a grand machinewhere equipment and abilities are restricted to rolesthemselves restricted to categories At the top of the pyramid sits the commanderwho gets access to the leader voice chat channel to communicate with officersand who can use mapwide abilities like supply dropsbombing runsspawn vehicles or issue map marker orders for the team Beneath the commander are the officerswho are in charge of relaying information between their squad and other officers and the commanderand issuing orders to their squad An infantry officers squad who has access to the usual shooter roles Engineers can build and destroy structuressupport can provide construction supplies and ammomedics can revive and heal teammatesassault gets access to SMGs and more grenadesand so on Each squad is expected to follow orders from their officer and communicate as a small team of their own Alternatively to infantrythere are special squad types for recon and armourwith twoman sniper teams and tank crews respectivelyeach having their own specialised roles and exclusive abilities and geara match will unfold with the three squad types working together under their officerswho in turn work with other officers and their commander as one great teamshifting between attackdefence and support The latter is most interestingbecause there are cases where some players or even an entire squad will be dedicated to logisticsdriving supply trucks back and forth to build defenses in controlled territory These unofficial roles are just as important as any medic or riflemanallowing players to fortify pointsman artilleryor act as infantry support or repair crews for tanks Participating in this massive cooperation never fails to be thrilling I enjoy getting headshots on the frontline or sneaking into an enemy objective and laying mines downbut theres a quiet satisfaction to spending an hour transporting supplies to engineers or building intricate layers of barbed wire and barricades thats just as rewarding Intellectually engaging with the mapthe movement of the teamevaluating risk and reward  these are rare treats that make not shooting a single time the entire match just as fun as doing so a thousand timesand no matter the roleextensive use of the map and compasss grid coordinatesbearingscardinal directions and distance measurements separates the good players from the bestbut its one of the first pressure points where things can go horribly wrong A match in Battlefield can be turned around by a single personeven despite the vast scale All it takes is a great flank and quick reflexes or helicopter pilot to potentially dominate an entire teambut in HLL the opposite is true  most conquests are a meat grinder regardless of your individual experience or skill In fact the better both teams arethe longer conquest takes It can thus become frustrating to have your performance tied so intrinsically to the teams A great squad could theoretically turn the tablesbut most of the time youre simply at the mercy of your officer and commander or lack thereofand while the highs of teamwork are higher than they otherwise would bethe lows of miscommunication and a lack of team autobalancing are very low indeed This is offset by the games intentional deemphasising of player statshiding killdeath ratios or victimnemesis trackers away in a secondary screenbut the act of dying 20 times in a match and losing at the end still stings Such an issue is however an unavoidable result of the demands of teamwork When things go well  which they mostly do  HLL shines Matches tend to ebb and flow over wide frontlinesincorporating the staccato pacing that can at times near the absurd There are points when youll have been lying on your stomach for five minutes until a single shot pierces the silence and your enemy a hundred metres away falls dead in a heapand the rifles echo fades into silence there are others when youll be sprinting out of a trench into a wall of enemies in a vast field scarred by craters and debrisdodging the rain of bullets and competing bombing runs as tanks charge through the cacophony and their thunderous fire sends your head spinning The magnitude of the action can be truly impressiveand knowing that its often the result of those 49 coordinating strangersfrom infantry riflemen to sniping saboteurs all following the violent vision of a single commander at the helmis awesomeimperfections in audioand poor level design that marr the proceedingsbut presentation and controls are generally excellentgiving HLL a sleekness uncharacteristic of multiplayer shootersand far surpassing Arma 3Squador any other milsims And realisticallyyoure going to struggle to find another indieAA game that looks or sounds as good as thismuch less at such an enormous scale HLL isnt a perfect game by any meansbut its relentless focus on teamworktrimming of fatand straightforward design make it the best time Ive had with a shooter in eons There isnt much room for one man army heroics in its actionwith all facets of its design encouraging and rewarding teamwork instead With ample space for gameplay styles from solitary sabotage to quiet construction and frontline armoured engagementstheres something for everyone Its a mature game for players who are tired of the uncontrolled chaos of Battlefield or Call of Duty that makes most matches blend together into an indistinct haze of inconsequential mass slaughterand enormously thankfully it also eschews their stats pagesstorefrontscaricaturesque customisationbattle passesdaily missions and endless notifications and popups that make those competitors become overwhelming assaults on your senses that also demand to be treated like a second job It still needs some polishand some new maps and equipment would be welcomebut Ive hugely enjoyed my time playing HLL Cerebral without becoming exclusionaryintense without becoming mindnumbingI cannot recommend this enough as a minimalistic breath of fresh airhelps me forget about hersaw a guy literally explode 00I played a medic and dispensed more Opiates than the Sackler familyFirst off I want to say that I have never reviewed a game before in my life but this game has changed that Nearly 2 hours in I was thinking I’d probably refund the game I didn’t really understand the mechanicscouldn’t see anyone to kill and often got killed out of nowhere after wandering around the map for a long long time trying to find some action Then I got talking in game to a few players and got caught up in their enthusiasm and missed the refund window so perseveredunforgivingbrutalbeautiful and requires teamwork and communication to get the best from itbut when it all falls into place it’s an experience like no other I’ve had playing and FPS It’s immenseimmersivedeeptacticalterrifying and hilarious by turns You can’t play this like Battlefield or CoD and it rarely rewards lone wolf activity behind enemy lines but when you’re in a good squad with a decent command plan it’s amazing fun and so rewarding when your efforts pay off with a point capture or even better a game winactive in the various places you’d hope and willing to listen and alter roadmap priorities as a result of player feedback There’s a public roadmap and patches already out and in mid July a big update coming with a new map amongst other added features and fixesEdited for now 2 hours Fix the shit with serversI dont give a shit about anything elsequeues and loading times into new games take so long I dont want to play the game anymore
1,Loved it so much I showed my wifethe person who rage quits Little Big Planetstuck with it until she beat the game TwiceThis piece of art right herea great soundtrackand is a big fan of Metroidvania style games Oh yeahit has no direct markers telling you where to go it simply throws you into the world Hallownest it is called and leaves the exploring up to youand it seems the devs are going to continue adding more content which is hype Give it a tryYou wont be dissapointedI didnt pay enough for this DIFFICULTY I got this game on salebut even if I paid full price it still feels like I would be ripping off the devsProsIts 22Im 29 years oldmakes you want to punch a hole through your monitor and then rub your face all over the broken glassh1TLDRh1extremely satisfying combatresponsive controlsand last but not leasta unique world to explore that feels like a real adventureso avid it lasted to the very end of my several walkthroughs one hundred ingame hours later This is how I found interest in games again this is why I consider Hollow Knight one of the best games ever made and probably the best Metroidvania to this date It gave me what I thought I had lost forever – that childlike feel of the big adventure Nowlet’s talk about the detailswithout any memory of who you are or where you are heading an empty vessel At firstyou have no clue of your purpose there is no map in your inventory – you have to acquire it later You proceed blindly into an unknown and strangely hostile environment because you feel some weird connection to this place Something is not right you see it clearly with your black holes of eyesand you try to solve the mystery With each step you takewith each new character you interact withthe beautiful story slowly unfolds before your voiceless hero You don’t speak at all the only thing you possess to cast your will is your sharp needle and fossilized bug shells called Geo that serve as a local currencydiverseand highly customizable with different spells and charms Do you remember those classic games where you have to play with a slowclumsy character that is efficient only when your timing is precise to the automation Forget them Hollow Knight gives you the pleasure of fighting how you want and how you enjoy Of courseyou still have to time your movements rightbut it all comes with more versatility and a lot more satisfaction It is so addicting that even fighting mobs in the same zonesagain and againis not a chorepowerupscombosspellscharms to learn and useand everything is easy to pick up Later in the gameyou roam the vast world of Hallownest like a deadly ninjawarlockparkourist As with combatthe movement after some progress is also very satisfyingwhich looks unbelievably majestic in a world of militant bugs The music of Christopher Larkin is equally grand Everyone praises orchestral music in Ori and the Blind Forest  Ori and the Will of the Wispsalthough I prefer Hollow Knight’s solemn and melancholic compositions They sound so softso gentlelike a lullaby or a fairy tale It oddly fits the gameplayprobably with ugly nostalgic sentiments along the line It is one thing when you experience this kind of bond with something when you are a kid It is another thing when the creation of human imagination manages to touch you similarly when you are long past your teenage years It means a lot to me Thank youTeam Cherry You did something truly exceptional hereYesyoure seeing it correctly I have 3 hours on this gameI played through about 25 of those hoursand I can confidently say that this isand might always bemy favorite gameit can definitely make you feel lost and a little frustrated trying to find out where to go especially after Greenpathat least for memany points in the game where youll get stuck for literal hours trying to get past If you tilt easily or are an ardent completionistyou might have a bad time You will probably never get to the Land of Stormsthe movement mechanics can feel really unfairespecially at the most difficult platforming sections WHY DOES MONARCH WINGS SEND YOU DOWN FIRSTalthough I think learning and mastering the mechanics is all just part of the gameIve heard that this games story feels very similar Not sure how this is a conbut felt that it was important to mentionbut I think theres a reason this is my favorite gamethis game is massive My first 112 of this game took me a little under 1 hoursif not actually 1 hours Nowevery other playthrough of this game that Ive done took me significantly less timebut considering that this game was made by a team of three people and that this game is a quarter the price of Dark SoulsId say that the amount of content in this game is remarkable And that content isnt filler content Few rooms in this game are Almost every room will have something new in iteither a new enemya new mechanicupgradea piece of the storyor a secret Since its initial releasethree free content packs have come outalong with one major update with a paid DLC coming in 219 Every one of the content packs released so far has had so much new contentincluding some of the most difficult bosses in the game Hidden Dreams came out with bosses thatif beaten enoughcan kill you with a single blow The Grimm Troupe arrived with a dream variant on a newalreadydifficult boss that took me over three hours of attempts to beatalong with the hardest platforming that you might ever come across Finallystrike Gods and Glory strike Godmaster arrivedadding a bossrush modeexciting variants on old bosses that made them even more difficulttwo more endingsand a boss that easily overthrew the Grimm Troupe boss as the hardest enemy this game has to offerthe bosses are toughwelldesignedand the learning curve for them is quite good I can say that I can count the number of bosses that I actually disliked on one handand thats being pretty harsh for a few of them And there are so manyand so many variantsthe color pallet for everything in each area is spot onand they all contribute a part to the amazing story So immersive and so fleshed out It looks and sounds so good bless youChristopher Larkenbless youthe story seems to be very baselinejust little bits of lore to piece together You dont even know who your character isalthough you just assume youre the Hollow Knight But slowlyyou learn about the devastating events that eventually leads to this beautiful worlds demise There are five endingsand once you learn that there was more to do in order to fix this broken kingdomyou feel compelled to keep goingand is one of the richest worlds you will ever dive into Youll become a much better player just by getting through the gameand youre likely to love nearly every moment of it This is the only game that Ive encountered that has significant portion of its player base sad that they didnt pay MORE for this game in order to support the developers An amazing world with an even better soundtrackI highly recommend this game above all othersthe genius company behind this gamedecided not to make the DLC THEYRE INSTEAD MAKING AN ENTIRELY NEW GAME IN ITS PLACE This is also a pro for buying the game SUPPORT THIS AMAZING COMPANYDont get it on a salebecause youll feel like you owe the devs money The price is outrageously low for what you getBetter than sexI was playing the cracked version After 2 hours I realized this the game is way too good for that Bought without second thoughts DIFFICULTY h1Short Reviewh1but still incredibly satisfying The art style is charming and filled with dread at the same timemaking it one of the most visually appealing The interwoven areas of Hallownest are as rewarding to explore as theyre excitingwith each area offering something newboth visually and mechanically Even the few bugs cant ruin the momentum of this masterpiece of a gamea land of bugs hidden beneath the surface of the earthyet complexh2functioning as your special move As you progress through the gameyoull slowly get more special movesknown as Nail Artsbut I didnt find myself using them very often since you first had to charge them before being able to unleash them upon your foes Yetsomehow Hollow Knight manages to pull off the nearimpossible to make its combat simpleyet complex While this term is quite contradictoryIts how I would best describe the combat Im going to compare it to Dark Souls If youve played any of those gamesyoull know that the range of attacks you can perform is very limited Where these games get their complexity from lies in the moves of the enemiesall of which have unique movesetswith each move being telegraphedallowing for the player to counter it before its too late The same can be said for Hollow Knight I was impressed at the sheer number of different enemies since I went in knowing that the game was made by a very small team of people According to the game itselfthere are over 1 different enemy types Suresome of them are different variations of one kindbut most of them are unique This creates an experience that never gets tiresomeeven though the game isnt that complex There are still some possibilities for those who want to specialize in certain character builds The game offers you a set of Charms that you can equip to get different bonuses These could be extra range for your weapon or a shield that protects you while youre healing yourself Charms can be found by exploring the environments of Hallownest Theres a lot of themand this causes the exploration to be rewarding and worth your timeand thats a good thingh2with bosses that will absolutely test your patience The satisfaction once you beat that boss youve been stuck on for the last few hours islike alwaysincomparable to anything else I found the bosses to be surprisingly consistent I expected that there would be your usual irritating and unfair bossesbut I didnt feel like I encountered any of that kind during my entire playthrough Every single boss felt fairwith telegraphed moves and a moveset that wasnt too hard to mastersome of which are easyothers brutally hardrequiring high precision and wellplanned moves Im not one whove got a big knack for platformersso I did sometimes find myself challenged by these sequencesbut they never seemed unfairyou should be familiar with its charming art style Its visually breathtaking and uniquedistinguishing Hollow Knight from any other game  It gives the game a feel of dread while also having a soothingalmost cozy feeling to it I adored the design of the characters friend and foe alike Instead of featuring humansHollow Knight takes a unique turnhaving bugs serve as the main race of the game The game fully takes advantage of thiswith character designs that can only be described as exceptionally creative Everything is simply so beautifuland it makes you want to stop up just to look at every little detail put into the world Each animation feels precise and just as weighty as it needs to be Everything from the attacks of you and your enemies to the movement looks incredible Combine this with an almost depressingly sad soundtrackincluding a unique theme for almost every area in the gameand youve got a game that nails everything to do with presentationwith their individual enemy typescolor schemes and platforming mechanics All of the areas are intertwoven into one complete worldwith a Metroidvania level design Theres multiple ways to access each areaand theyre all satisfyingly connected Inspired by the bonfires of Dark Soulsresting at a bench will fully replenish your healthand allow you to equip and unequip your charms These benches are far and few betweenand its reliefing whenever you find one Some places also require special abilities to be accessed These are often found later in the game off the beaten pathforcing you to take your time exploring carefullyif you want to see everything the game has to offer Its always satisfying when you finally find the ability you needed to get to an unaccesible area in one of the earlier locations youve visited You can also upgrade both your healthamount of SOUL the essence you use to perform special moves and heal yourselfand the damage of your weapon This is done by finding a specific number of the required item needed to upgrade them Just like charmsthese items are hidden throughout all of Hallownestand are often easy to misstheres still a lot left for me to do I still need to defeat the bosses I missedfully upgrade my equipmentand uncover the remaining secrets of the game I look forward to continuing my journeyas Hollow Knight simply is incredibleHollow Knight doesnt come without some rareyet irritating bugs Yesthat header pun was intentional I encountered a bug where moving the joystick would open the map and begin scrolling to the left This happened a total of 2 times throughout a 6hour playthroughso it was very rarebut still annoying The game also happened to not register my jumps a few timesbut Im not sure if it was a problem with my controlleror the game These are the only two cases of bugs and glitches I remember They didnt ruin the experience at allbut they were still irritating to encounterI tried experimenting with giving each section a header to make the review easier to read Please let me know what you thinkbI would appreciate it if you took the time to check out some of my other reviews urlhttpsstoresteampoweredcomcurator3751152hereurl Alsofeel free to leave a comment on this review if you want to discuss it or feel like I overlooked somethingiThere arent many games that have cast a longer shadow over the industry than Dark Soulsand much like what youll find lurking within them its been a bit of a curse Too many indie games have been overtuned to provide a similarly punishing experiencenarratives have been undercooked to mimic the subtle storytellingand action has been slowed to a crawl to imitate the methodical combat But some titles have taken the right bits of inspiration and mixed them with their own brew of mechanicsand from just such a concoction you will find Hollow Knight And in many waysthe mix Team Cherry has come up with is a richer taste than what inspired itdarkscary world of bugs Its bugs all the way downyou see the kingdom of Hallownest was once a great and powerful societyspread across deep warrens beneath the surface But something went wrong long ago and the kingdom fell silent Now only the tiny hamlet of Dirtmouth remains to mark its locationthough recently bugs have found themselves drawn to the lost kingdom in search of something You will follow them down theremeet thembattle them and the unknown denizensand change the fate of the cursed kingdom foreverright Hollow Knight gets thatand thats one of its first and most prominent achievements The tone this title strikes is both unique and flawlessan unexpected mix of charmdespairhumorand dread Youve probably noticed already that your little dude is absolutely adorablenipping along with his little white mask and nail The other bugs nice enough to speak to you are often just as cutebut sometimes have sinister edges to themor in a few cases are downright creepy Friendly critters may crack jokes or help you outwhile others relay ominous portends or warn you of the many dangers in and around Hallownestand each area has a distinct style and atmosphere that hits all the right notes to evoke powerful reactions From the first area of dark caves and ruins you may end up in a lush grotto of vines and creaturesa pleasant change until you realize the water is acidic and every bush may hide terrible dangers Or you could descend into the caverns of potent fungiwith mysteriousbulbous foes that must be approached with great caution Later journeys take you to decaying citiessilent graveyardsbustling coliseumsdesolate wastesand two of the most horrifyingly oppressive places I have ever visited in a video game Im not kidding hereHollow Knight has topped titles from Halflife to SOMA in crafting locations that give me relentless anxietyfighting battles and dodging traps at a measured pace Team Cherry wisely elected to ignore this aspect of their inspirationinstead making your little knight swiftnimbleand refreshingly responsive The controls here are tightallowing you to execute your dashes and sword swings with ease as you dance around bugs both great and smallairborne and groundedarmed and fanged At no point was I frustrated with the pace at which I could move aboutand the fluid motion made the elaborate and creative battles against bosses and larger enemies all the more enjoyableweapon skills and wall climbing and such But even here there are unique implementationslike one of your earliest powers being essentially unlimited horizontal flight Uncovering this treasure so early on feels incredibly liberating and excitingbut also reveals to you just how important verticality is to the game You can further augment your movement and combat with charms that can extend your sword reachchange how you move when hit or attackingor grant you all sorts of additional effects I will admit a little disappointment here at how essential some charms are over others and how the limited slots for them tend to keep me from experimenting muchthoughlike the rare bug I get where my charged attacks dont workor how spread out the fast travel is That latter one is a bit of a pain in truthbecause the stations used for fast travel tend to be quite far from points of interest You certainly wont be relying on them as much as you would Castlevania warp rooms or Dark Souls bonfire warps The map is another aspect that could be a dragbut honestly I love it You dont fill in new areas of the map until you reach a save pointand to get a map at all you have to locate an amateur cartographer in each area He tends to be near one of the logical entrances and has audio and visual cues to lead you to himso theres a bit of tension in each new locale as you seek him outreally Hallownest isnt just a maze to run aroundits a functioning world with its own rules and requirements The things Hollow Knight asks you to do are never unreasonable and fit with the dark and unusual tone of the places you visit Nothing is out of place hereand it all works in concert to immerse you in this strange world of bugs and mysticism The characters and locations are far more memorable to me than those of similar gamesin large part because they can be funny or creepy or adorable and still fill their role in a seamless narrative Theres a lot to unpack about Hallownestbut instead of just resting on riddles this game makes you WANT to puzzle it outit looks and sounds absolutely breathtaking The handdrawn aesthetic gives the enemies and environments an extra spark of lifecomplimenting the strong lines and flat colors with impressive animated details The environments in particular are labors of love that bring together careful lineworkbold lightingand rich particle effects to make them feel deep and authentic And the sound design does just as wellwith appropriately subtlemelancholy melodies and impactful effects Theres so much going on here that it baffles me how it could all work together so perfectly and yet it doeson and on for easily 2 hours or more Hollow Knight does what few games manage to dotake clear inspiration from classics and find its own way to surpass themand I certainly hope youll check out more of them at httpsgoldplatedgamescom or on my urlhttpsteamcommunitycomgroupsaudishcurationcuration pageurlDear Team CherryPlease for the love of

reviews at httpsstoresteampoweredcomcurator3234442315 for this game An absolute steal Better than most 6 games Ive purchased
1,Id recommend Killing Floor 2but with reservations Its a very smoothblasty horde shooter that complementsbut doesnt replaceurlhttpsteamcommunitycomidtrarrecommended1250the original gameurl Its shiniereschewing the gritty grindhouse aesthetic of Killing Floor 1 for a more scifi look and much higher production values Every character has a unique voice actor now And while its fasterpaced gameplay is perhaps not quite as methodical as KF1it can still be fun At its bestit does keep true to the Killing Floor spirittheres a couple problems that have become noticeable in recent timesbut I didnt find them much of a problem bI do however think 10 for uoneu DLC weapon is too steep of a priceb and most of the community agrees At least people who own the DLC weapons share them automatically with other players Fortunately there are now Armory packs that let you buy weapon bundles for a relatively cheaper price per weaponso this isnt as bad of an issue as it wassuch as the shotgun revolver or the explosive boomsticksome of them are rather bizarre the Field Medic didnt need a railgunnor does the Berserker need a microwave gunwith most of the effort going into new paid DLC weapons These weapons ship alongside a couple free reskin gunssome new cosmetic skins usually communitymade and a communitymade map If the developers attention is focused elsewhere right now I cant entirely fault them for thatbut I hope this isnt all thats left for the games futureiespeciallyi if the developers have seen fit to sell paid weaponsbut it isnt really that good as a result A rework has been talked about for a whilebut has not yet materializedthe gun isoundsi are rather quiet compared to the first gamewhere they were more visceral and satisfying Assets are reused on multiple mapswhich would be fine if the game wasnt aiming to be so detailedbecause said assets dont fit every map theyre in Italian warning signs in a Texan embassyDanish banners pleading for help in the middle of Paristhat sort of thing They also replaced the original menu musicwhich harkened back to KF1s menu musicwith a track thats in my opinion worseit just needs more attention from its developers to rectify its issues Whether it will receive that attention is to be seenExtremely fun and addictive gameBut dont realize that Tripwire has always been money hungry Look at Kiling Floor 1All the DLCs you need to buyYoure giving it a bad ratingthis purchase is dedicated to my awesome friend Gerald John Santos who passed away last april of 2018  me and gerald go way back since high school  sadly he was not able to play this game  we  were planning to buy KF2 as soon as he leaves the hospital but he never did we had a lot of memories on the first game while it pains me to say it but  we pirated KF1 because we were broke   he said to me since we had a lot of fun lets purchase it on steam to help the developers  this is my second purchase on steam bought KF1  RIP GeraldNormally I’m not that type of guy who makes reviews about gamesbut with Killing Floor 2 I’m glad to make an exceptionabout three years ago I played the original Killing Floor and always enjoyed thatso I didn’t had to think twice when I saw the release Killing Floor 2 Back at that point there were 4 perks to choose from3 official maps to playaround 25 weapons to use and 7 playable characters to choose fromthe amount of weapons and playable characters have at least doubled17 new official maps were introduced3 new game modes HoldoutPvP and Endless modseveral new zeds and bosses made their way into the gameevery now and then there are events with unique rewards and is there the integration of the steam marketmaking it possible to get weapon skins andor character customizations And then I haven’t even mentioned the customcommunity createdcontent that is availablesomething many other developers could learn from Even after the full release of the game they keep developing new and free content Big compliment to the people at Tripwire Interactive for creating this masterpieceit breaks my heart to not recommend this game after these many hours of funbut the devs have decided to put more than just skins behind outrageous paywalls and im tired of it at the time of this reviewowning all dlc weapons cost 100 for NINE weaponswhich is absolutely ridiculousAs a fan of the original Killing Floor mod and stand alone gamethis feels like a pure upgradethe looks are just sexy and the pure carnage they spit out is amazingright to the moment when you blow their limbs offwhile most other classes dont have that abilityYETbut if i was running from something with a chainsaw for an armId be running faster And probably sg my pants a little as wellso a very little part of its content is live at the momentthan 100 weapons that are literally as broken as they get Same goes for mapsI love this game I really doyou dont have to buy themas you can use them if someone else has the packbut the point still stands Ive tried this new Summer Slideshow updateand the new Glock18C on Gunslinger is extremely overpowered This gun alone is a pay to win weaponwhich is going to be locked behind a 10 paywall This is an action that I dont want to stand forand as much as it saddens me to say thismakes me not want to support this game anymore As much as I love this gamethe Developers are trying to milk whats left of the player base for all they can with small updatesgiving a single map every six months or soand DLC packs that contain neartofully pay to win weaponsthe guns are amazing to useand cutting down hordes is absolutely exhilarating Do I recommend you buy the DLC packs No Theyre too overpriced for what you getand what you do get makes the game borderline easy if you know what youre doing And considering that all youre doing is shooting zedsgetting to know what youre doing doesnt take you that long at allAlrightfor those of you who HAVE played KF1Ill get to you a little bit laterpromiseKilling Floor 2 is simply the best wavebased horde FPS game out therethe graphics are nothing to sneeze at and its challenging Currently Early Accessyou get 4 perks classes to choose from and level up  each with their own playstylepros and cons Despite clearly being at its best and based around coop gameplayyou can also play solo  perfectly viable too as it gets rebalanced for itwe start with an important question Is it an improvement Yes Yes it is Remember how going up in difficulty was nothing but numbers The Zeds HPspeed and damage would increase while the players money gain and item pickups would decrease Welpthose days are over for the most part D the difficulty increase respects the weapons and players  no longer turning Zeds into bullet sponges as they keep the exact same HP as in any lower difficulty Now the real threat is how they become more aggressive and behave differently ie  jumping and dodging which makes it even harder than the previous gameso no more AFK welding for the Support Specialists And the levels now go up to 25making it feel a bit less grindy since you level up more oftenthis game is a must buy for the new players and veterans alike despite still being in Early AccessThis one is hardI absolutely adore the original Killing Floorand as my hours might suggestKF2 had me very excited as wellI honestly cannot recommend this game anymoreit brings me no joy to say this at all as Im very passionate about this franchisebut I feel like its being done a disservice at this point in timeKF1 had both cosmetics and DLC which were added later in its lifespanI happily supported both those forms of content as we got free updates with fresh new things in returnone of the devs even gave me a beta key since I sank so many hours in the originalthat was a very special moment I will never forget and the months following the start of early access were greatnew weapons and perks and highly detailed maps to keep the experience freshcrateskeysrandom cosmetics and artificial rarityI prefer to pay straight up for content I want like in KF1 so I wasnt a fan but I was willing to look past this as updates need to be funded somehowthese were in KF1 as well at the price of 4 weapons for roughly 8 eurosbut in KF2 you get one weapon for 10 eurosjust oneno new assets or anythingjust community made mapsthen the cosmetics which you pay premium price for or gamble for through crates are also community madepay for the gamepay to open your cosmetic cratespay for new weapons and get very shallow content drops in returnbut I disagree with the way its treated nowadaysI would recommend making up your own mind with different sources and reviewsbut for me its not worth it anymoreh1Return of the Patriarch  Microtransaction thoughts below the reviewh1and was it worth the waitit was h1so I was very excited to see a second one While I normally do not buy into these early access titleshow could I say no to Tripwirelets get startedthere is currently 4 classes with about 4 weapons for eachas well as a few offperk weapons like the Katana or the Flamethrower You can use bANYb weapon at any timejust like the first The weapon you use will give you points for that classso say you have a medic pistol with a commando rifle You will be able to rack up points for medic using the healing function whilst using the rifle to earn yourself the commando points ZED time is still prominantand it is soso satisfying The visuals will run into a sincity like lookwith only red standing out amongst the blackgray and white filtered backgrounds and characters Most weapons have a reasonably large amount of kickbut this further emphasizes the need to have trigger disciplineyou can see the obvious The graphics upgradethe animationsand of course the enviroment designs Howeverin this game there are tons of small things that all compile into what sets this game apart You can shoot out lightsblood is persistentand there are bTONSb of different animationsboth for players and zeds Enemies flinch when shotand it varies heavily on what weapon you are using Shooting a clot in a shoulder with a pistol will only make him flinch a tiny bitbut upping the ante and shooting him in the chest with a rifle will cause him to violently flail backwards and nearly lose his balance You can shoot off several parts of their bodyhead wounds will start small and slowly wear their flesh away until there is only a meaty remnant that looks nothing like what it once did until that satisfying head pop Everythingand I mean bEVERYTHINGb feels much more alive and less clunky than the firstfrom the reload animations to the death animationsits hard to say You will get 4 perks and limited weaponrywith only 3 maps to spare As it standthere is much more content in the first game Howeverif you buy into the early accessyou are not only supporting Tripwirebut you give yourself a chance to watch this game bloom You get to experience a game that has lots of love in itand you can see that Tripwire cares about this game Yesit has bugs Yesthere are glitches Nothere is no buyers remorse from me If you expect a full gameyou may want to lower your expectationsbut this is certainly not a bad way to start off a early access gameincluding a female one These characters are all uniqueand have their own voices They will talk a bLOTband this is not a bad thing They will call out ammokevlarand weapons They will talk to each other with idle banter whilst youre shopping at the traderand they will also pitch a few jokes There are a few stereotypesbut it adds to the quirky and goofy traits they all haveand they even have things you can add to themlike gas masks or face masks You can also change their clothing colourhair colour and a few other neat features absent in the first gameand so far I dont see much of a difference between them Howeverthey behave much like the same gamespare their animations They will oftentimes hold you just as that gorefast is chargingor the fleshpound is roid raging The gorefasts move fastand are tall hulks that you do NOT want to get close to The siren is short and blends into groupsoften hiding behind clots or bigger enemies The stalkers are nearly invisibleand are disturbingly quiet The skrakes and fleshpounds make roars when they enterthat strikes that scene of oh no into you And the final boss is HARD This game makes the zeds feel more alive than everand I love every second of itthis game is a newborn It shows promiseand it has loving parentsas Tripwire has shown itself to be I can see this game becoming just asif not moreof a classic game as the first one The game feels much smoothermuch faster pacedand it has a few moments in it that will make you jump and scream when that clot turns you around and holds onto you as a fleshpound is nearing you I would highly reccomend thiseven to those who like to wait to see if early access games grow at all Time will tellbut I firmly believe in Tripwireat its current statewith the only thing bringing it down is the lack of weaponry and classeshowever both of which have been promised to have their numbers bolsteredso this review will be updated as the game growsthis has been interesting A new classan ingame storeskins and crates all kind of thrown all in Maybe I havent been playing this game enoughbut Im going to change that Sowith that saidlets move onmaking his kill potential relatively lower than Hans He still uses his signature stimpacks to survive after a certain amount of damage is takenand still only has three It seems with each one he takesthe health he gains is less than beforewhich doesnt make him insanely strong Howeverhe cloaks a lot more often than the Patriarch from the first gamebut is also extremely loud when he movesmaking it relatively easy to pinpoint a location as a noncommando player Furthermorejust because he is easierdoes not mean he is not fun to play against I have had countless laughs against the Patriatch with friends from his sometimes erratic behavior and his obsession with getting right in your face before unlcoaking I believe he could do with some buffingthoughto bring him a bit more onto terms with Hanswhat more could you want The Gunslinger has a wide array of weaponsthough this is mostly because every weapon he can buy has a dial wield function Two deaglesrevolversor 111s Ohthe choices He is a relatively mobile class that enjoys the benefits of being able to harvest weak zeds very easilyand using the stacks he earns from farming these smaller zeds to tackle the bigger ones with tons of damage Plus he has style in his reloadsso go give him a try alreadyTripwire has done the sameand this community outcry has been quite large Howeverlet us remember that the first game also had similar marketingjust in the form of DLC packs for skins Skinspeopleskins that dont give any stat boosts or mobilityjust make your character stand out a bit more While I do agree that releasing these micros in the aftermath of the Payday incidentI do not believe that we should be reacting as harshly as we are Let us remember that Tripwire has yet to release any weapons OR characters that we have had to pay forand that they have done this practice in the past with the first Killing Floor Improved FPS mechanics from RO2 onwardseven this small selection of KF2s new features were everything I could have wanted from a KF sequel and moreI very much enjoyed the first iteration of this game The second version however just doesnt quite feel the samePlease reconsider choosing Hell on Earth difficulty if you are Level 2its all doshMaybe the best 10 bucks ever spent on STEAM on salebut in this case Id say BUY THIS GAMEas it was for me you may find it a welcome release from so many of the grindy games that are popular todayor idiots talking smackno problem just randomly get into any server and play this for 15 minutesThe Floor still posses no threat and thus cannot be killedNeeds more goreand bodies Luckily theres a thing for thatYou can tell the developers care heavily for the community when they add physics collision to the wads of dosh you throw around so that you can make a literal pile of moneyKilling Floor 2 is an improvement on a timeless classic If you thought KF1 was a fun experienceyoull only have more fun with this one If you havent played the first oneyou dont need to KF2 is a completely standalone game and improves in every way The first Killing Floor was originally a mod for Unreal Tournament 2004and it definitely shows via clunkiness Thats all nonexistent in this game  Tripwire did a great job with making KF2 feel like its a standalone gamemind you in a game of 16 players The classes feel well balanced aside from the insanely strong Berserker and fun to use Gameplay is really fluidshooting and meleeing feels great and it gets really difficult and strategical really fast Its unlike other zombie horde gameswhich I dont usually likebut KF2 is differentall with their own tiny little backstories and personalitieslike in KF1 Level design is great and theres a lot of mapseven more when you include Steam Workshop integration and modding To top it all offthe game features an amazing metal soundtrack from various artists to headbang to while playingso Im glad to see that Tripwire decided to stray away from those here You buy the gameyou get everything along with free future updates Killing Floor 2 does have microtransactions with casesskins and cosmeticswhich I dont really care aboutbut theyre never in the way and I dont mind them that muchwhich is cool It actually takes a lot of effort to get bored of shooting zeds in Killing Floorwhich is something you cant say from most other horde mode games Id still recommend the first Killing Floor if youre looking for a more difficult and intense experiencealthough both games are far from casualIm a simple manAlrightafter about 102 hours of playing this gamelet me write a reviewTripwire failed to listen to the communities complaints and suggestionsthe game was horrendously unbalancedand holy shit was there no content Not to mention theyd delete any negative criticism of their game from their forumsand now equipped with a full team againseem to be making a much more polished game I write this review after playing the new Beta patch that introduced the SWAT perk and various reworks of existing perksas wellto my surpriseadded additional weapons to preexisting perks Such as the Katana being added to berseker and the M16 added to Demo After this patch I find myself not being able to get enough Killing Floor 2 in my blood stream Maybe its the excitement for my fancy new in game Canadian ball capor maybe its that the game actually FEELS ENJOYABLE now I used to compare Tripwire to the guys who made District  First they made a ruggetlow budget movie that was really goodand people loved it District and they got so much money from that that they said they were going to make another great moviewhich ended up flopping because in reality they have no idea what theyre doing Elysium Obviously this analogy is no longer trueand I think if you played the game in its current state youd agree I feeland I hopethat its only going to get better from herelet me hit you with a few final pros and consfast paced CoOp gameplayperksand hopefully one day weaponsaudio is fantasticget you pumped soundtrack Who doesnt love a  bit of Demon Hunter
1,I played the precursor to this game copied almost identicallyShop Heroeson and off for several years This game is nearly a carbon copybut a more polishedsimplified versionand a couple hundred dollars It was an immensely fun bit of nostalgia I dont regret my purchasesthough I am quitting today I had two weeks of funand items break frequently Expensive gear can take days or weeks of farming to obtain So basicallyif you are f2p u must run all your dungeons in junk disposable gearmeaning you will progress far more slowly And who on earth wants to play a game where you can never use the good gear you craft So I paid my 10 so I could play the gamecrossbowsand wands are behind a 0 paywall These items are all noticeably more powerful than the free recipesso it gives you an edge in combatbut more importantly economicallyand you could always go back and buy them later Shop titans apparently adds new p2w blueprints twice each month So theres 20 each pack Thenif you buy the packyou get 80 worth of flashback pack offers And againyou must buy them or the blueprints are gone forever A few packs give best in slot gear Having logged thousands of hoursI dont think I made any mistakes But doing so cost me 200 Then  days later I got my second pack offerwhich would inevitably be followed by another 80 of offers and I quitand of course sell for very high prices due to raritybut if you are going to require a 10 monthly feeit should not be necessary to also have extremely greedy p2w packs as well World of Warcraft offers an immense amount of content for 1 per month Shop Titans does not provide value for your money at allthis is permanent They can churn out two new blue print packs a monthbut the game doesnt even feel finished yet Theres no way to even sort your damned inventoryand realising I will probably have to spend 1000 in the 1st year just to get all the old packs is ridiculous And then Ill continue to be up for 60 a month in new packs each monthand the 10 monthly fee indefinitelyand this game will not thrive Disappointed This is shop heroes version 2 with ridiculously increased paywalls And its not like the rng ability system on heroes is any fun eitheras you can simply spend gems to reroll each attribute until you get the perfect herocompletely removing the rng Notice the 12 carbon copy ninjas with equal stats on top of the leader board This costs 20k gems or 200 if you paid for it in cash Sorry but if the game is built around the rng attribute systemit should not be possible to circumvent the rng simply by paying real moneypremium currency Allowing players to cookie cutter build the perfect characters with enough gems takes any of the funaccomplishment in obtaining strong heroes That you would get it was never in doubt it is just a matter of time or in game grindingyou could buy any of the old packs any time I was content buying what i saw a use forand let the rest be Forcing players to buy every pack because you never know for certain if they may become useful or meta in the future is not at all funlimited tiny mobile game One that I am quite attached to But the way this has been setup like a skinner box to try to milk extra money out removes any and all of the funwith the addition of dozens more pay packs Thank you for a fun 2 weeks of nostalgia But every time I think just maybe this mobile game will be different it never isWhod have thought itI assumed this was just a time management type gamequite like those But incredibly they have brought a mobile gaming experience to PC Time gated actionsbuying gemsrolling for prizespaid for perk bundles and even a £10 monthly subscription to get all the perksgod help us if it start moving into the PC platform as wellUntil recently I would have recommended this game to people due to what seemed to be a relatively unique concept and a lot of fun idle game mechanics The patch on April 7th2021 introduced a new content tier into the game that destroyed any fun of the shop progression mechanics By adding multiple stages of prerequisite crafts to every item in the new tier they effectively added hours of RNG dependent crafting that can only be shortened by being lucky or paying large amounts of money to the developers For years there were premium items that you had to pay to be able to get the crafting blueprintsbut if you waited long enough there were other ways to acquire themand ultimately you could complete all content without them Now with every item in the new tier requiring a precraftand those precrafts requiring precrafts it more accurately depicts modern supply chain mechanics that real life businesses have to deal with except that what is accurate in that regard does not make for as fun of a game with the multiple hours involved in each craft that has multiple stages I really used to enjoy this gamebut the devs decided to go in a different direction that I quite simply cannot recommend to peoplestrikeThis is an awesome gamestrike  SorryI had a moment of insanitylet me correct that statement This is everything wrong with microtransactions in the most obnoxious possible wayIm going to be overly generous and say I might even consider it at 20 just to account for modern inflation But for that price I expect a complete game Heck they could have slapped a 40 price tag on this and Id have only mildly scoffed while suggesting you wait for a sale price but still managed to leave a recommended tag on it The problem is they arent charging a price anywhere near what any other game will costthey are above it by quite a wide marginas do several othershonestly I could list you dozens that fill this niche and all in the  to 20 price range This was for a time a very popular genre back in the 2000 to 2010 era with dozens of games in the genre that are complete and charge a reasonable onetime costbut youll have one hand tied behind your back and someone will walk over and slap you in the face with a fish every once in a while just to remind you what a peasant you arebut maybe tolerate it if its not taking too much away from the core game play but this  YOU  YOUR HORSE  YOUR MOTHERand its a one time use so 10 againand againand again and nopenone of these single use things were included with your 120 a year subscriptionthat was just to be allowed to use some basic expected featuresotherwise  you craft it againwhich is a wait timerand since you have a lock on the number of things you can craft you either craft for sale which is what the game is supposed to be aboutrunning your shop or you craft for your team of champions to use which is how you get special items to craft other items to sell by sending champions out on missionsbut the interplay between these  features is just trading one set of wait timers for another all leading to paywall after grinding paywallthis game has itmany of these costs are slightly hidden If you look through the menu of what you can buy at any one timeyou might add it up and try to justify 10 here20 theremaybe that 100 cost one time will get you everything  Nopeevery few days youll find out theres another 20 to 30 thing to buy on top of your 120 subscription and your endless wave of would you like to spend gems to go faster  That you could easily just keep spending real money on Ive put many hours into this just trying to find some package deal that would justify a one time purchase that would justify its price tag and everything is just temporary boosts or minimal upgrades with no end in sight for what else needs to be purchasedcrafting quesupgrade quesyou cant set up a chain of things and then wait for them to finish everything requires 1 and wait and then activate the next in line And why cant you upgrade more than one thing at a time Even if they all have wait timersits just one Ill tell you why its intentionally designed to induce just enough frustration that you would like to speed up the process just a little so you can start the next one Wellthat will cost you real money and theres no end in sight for how many times it will recur this loop Its very much the same addiction model used on gamblers to suck every penny from their pocket A constructed amount of minimal fun in a tight loop of mild frustration that can be alleviated for just a small costbut a small recurring cost with no endif you have 100s 1000s  of dollars of disposable income that youre willing to simply throw away on a tycoon game maybe youll find yourself having 10 worth of funwould you consider following my curator pageurlIm lvl 23 as of posting this review  I will update this review as necessary when I progress furthermax worker levelsresource collection speedsetc to improve gameplay for all in guildearnable Fortune Zone Spin the wheel prizes for helpful items to be boughtPutting aside the 0 paywall to unlock all the base content in the gamethe additional paid packs to unlock more contentand the toxic community morons who claim that none of that existsthis game is pay to win at just about every turn EVERY SINGLE dungeon run shows you additional loot that you cannot earn unless you pay a 10 a month subscription feealong with ascension rewards and event dungeon loot The best free to play games offer paid currency purely for cosmetics or to expedite progression and not lock core content Shop Titans is not one of themeither way you will also run into frustrating UI issues that you cant even pay to fix The most obnoxious part of the game is that you are spammed every time you create an item of green or greater quality and the game asks you to spend gemsthe premium currencyto upgrade it This is absolutely useless and frustratingly moronic for just about 99 of the items in the bloody game which you would NEVER WASTE hundreds of gems upgrading for hardly any goldand makes mass producing cheap items a royal PITA after a while Againyou cannot even pay to fix this issue I might be able to recommend this game if they added a quality of life option to disable quality craft popups below a certain item tier which is the way it SHOULD bethe devs need to at least give players the option to get the two paywalled workersbuildings in the base game with diamondsand an option to hide the paywalled bonus loot youre shown after every dungeon but have to pay freaking 10 a month to get Not getting the extra loot is one thingeven worse is its bloody ludicrous having to see subscriptionpaywalled loot every quest clear screen Those two things alone are about as scummy as it gets with an F2P gameI actually love this gamegot addicted really fasttill I hit a pay wall Not being able to unlock Evelyn and the other one with in game meansjust sucked I dont mind all the other cash shop thingshell its a mobile type game anywayits expected But actually locking content behind a pay wall and a super expensive one at thatjust sucked all the joy out of the gameh1 Monetization h199b and here is whyyou craft for the most part The basic resources are generated passively additional necessary crafting materials come from dungeons Youll have a growing number of npcs you have to equip and send to the dungeons in a timegated browser game Their equipment has a chance to break and uyoull only have the option to repair it using gold when you have the monthly subu  if you dontthe equipment is gonethe screen will close in on them and you have to click on it to be able to continue gamingbut also all the additional items you would have gotten if you had the monthly sub99b to unlock the npc instantlyor spend b299b for another 10 progress to get themif you want to be able to craft everything there isget all the loot and be able to repair the equipment of your dungeon teamsthis free to play game is actually more like b70b plus b999b every month  offers for additional shop currency and immediately unlocked npcs not includedfanfare soundsupgrades bathed in circles of light30times a minute In regular gameplay you always make at least double your investment Its not possible to lose  the only question is how quickly you make even morethe term virtual crack comes to my mindUScompany created by Americans of Chinese descentpartly bought for 800 million by Netmarble GamesSouth Koreas largest mobile gaming companyof which Chinese tech conglomerate Tencent surpassed market value of 00 billion in 2018 is a 20 shareholderthe biggest Chinese money is behind this Is it revenge for the opiumLove playing this game  Leveling charactersforging special itemsbeing a shopkeeper  HoweverI still have to give it a negative review simply because of money  If I could just buy the full gamemaybe itd be okay  But there are sooo many things that cost 2030 to unlock  Youre talking 100s and 100s  Its insaneespecially when you have to pay a monthly amount if you want to receive 100 of your goods instead of only 0 loot on freeplay  Ill play it until I get really boredbut Im at the point where i need things unlocked and thats way out of my payrangeI simply cannot seem to afford this Free to play gamebut this game is taking it to a whole new level The game stimulates you to pay for certain special characters which unlock whole research treesfor a monthly subscription that allows you to repair extremely valuable items with a cheap resourceto further purchase ingame currency on top of your subscription and to continue sprinkling in cash into this free gamewell animated and has lots of contentbut there is simply no excuse for monetizing it so extensivelyits kind of addictiveit has cute graphics You hire heroestake them on questsbuild a shop however this is one of the most greediest paytowin games Ive personally played Ive heard theres worse out therebut if you are one of those people that has the money to pay to winhave at it if you might suffer from any sort of gambling addictionI would say definitely do noth1Monetization Titansh1those are prices for full gamesI really want to like this game For some reason it visually appeals to me But its a money grabber Even if you pay the 10month sub there are still buildings you HAVE to purchase with real money if you want themfrom what I can tell Someone please feel free to correct me if Im wrong about thattry Shop Heroes also available for free on Steam Its pretty much the same game but less frustrating and NOT a pay to winget ahead kind of gameWith no real endand being full of microtransactions and having pay walls I think i am done If you want to play a game like this with an actual story and dont mind an older game with Anime Art Style I would recommend Recettear An Item Shops TaleThe game is okbut dudeits INSANEPay to WinLook at how many hours i have on record playing this game  and i DO NOT recommend itbut just enough to make you want to spend money on it Ive spent just a few bucks and i regret itIve been playing this since about a month after releasecurrently L7 Probably put over 8k hours into it before they released a Steam version 8B net worth70B invested with almost no gemvesting The aforementioned isnt meant to be braggingjust an illustration of how much I used to enjoy this game Now it sucksnot because of the game itself but if you need a nonbot customer service rep good luck with that Bought 1600 gems via Steam 3 weeks agogot market banned for some dumb reason 2 weeks after that probably because Steam store glitched and I had to buy it twice to get it oncebut was only charged once so thought all was fineguess notand still market banned now No market  have to craft and farm everything yourselfnot even half as fun and progress slows to a crawl Sent 2 support tickets asking them why 34 days aparthave yet to get a response from either of themautomated or otherwise As is you are better off investing your life in something elseunless you want to just kill a few hours before moving on as is the case with just about every free game  My New Years resolution is to quit wasting time and money on games with microtransactions Thank you Kabam for the inspirationPay2Win gameand some crafters are only unlocked when paid with real moneyWith 00 hrs on shop heroes I was really looking forward to this gameits a much better looking game and gave me the impression that overall it was just a better version but barely an hr in and im hating it alreadyat every chance you are forced into posistions where you are fed microtransactions hey heres a chest but no keydont worry lets spend gems 3 mins into the game you cant trade in gems until you have spent 600 gems on cosmetics etc and everything feels restricted and guided down just one pathto get you to part with your money and if you have any hope of doing well in this game and want to enjoy the cool stuff you will need plenty of itthe established players that are £1000s deep into the game need as many fresh players as possible to validate thier purchases and will never give you the truth of the gameyou are already joining people with years behind them yet need to spend loads more and quickly to catch upthe community and just about every person out there a favor and avoid games like these so we can get back to games that actually have value and dont treat you like a cash cow to be exploitedsimply put it blocks you from speeding up your ranking progress or enjoying the game at a quicker pace whilst also providing experienced players with cheap precrafts for gold which would otherwise be sold for gems due to demandessentially brickwalling the player the either buy gems or wait until lvl 30 roughly before you can earn enough for free which will all be wasted on time saving itemsI like this game but theres one main reason Im rating it downit seems that legendary fusions which you have to pay real money to have regular access towhich claim to have a success rate of 0are not actually random  Ive failed on them far too many times in a row for it to be truly random based on my knowledge of C and other languages as well as the facts of probabilities  Alsousers on their forums have reported failing more than 10 times in a rowwhich is EXTREMELY unlikely on an untampered 0 roll  They must be employing some kind of custom randomgeneration class which actually lowers the effective success rate  The chance of failing ten times in a row on a legit 0 chance is 004882812the game is pretty fun if youre looking for something idleoriented without a lot of action and which doesnt require constant attention  It could use more customization options for the charactersbut the item system is well thought out and the herochampion system is a good diversion when you arent crafting or trading
1,Ive lived entire lives in this game  Braved bitter winters  Sorted and labeled crates of canned foodwondering how long it would last me  Tended crops and cursed the misfortune of plant disease  Fractured my leg and holed up in the corner of some dilapidated warehouse dying of thirst since I lacked the speed to get home safely  Ive lived a thousand lives and felt the touch of death so many timesnow Im only surprised when it doesnt come swiftlynoits a sweet release  Make no mistakeIve survived for a long timebuilt impregnable safehouses with selfsustaining cropshigh above where any zombie could reach  But that is simply a different kind of deathdeath in the form of boredombut it is a death all the same  It makes sense thoughdoesnt it  You are the last person on Earththe world is filled with endless zombiesthere is no happy ending to all of thisthe point is to create your own talemake a snapshot of experiences that are memorable  This game is really just an analogy for life and deathcompressed into a few hours at a timeand how you choose to spend your time reflects on your personality  How will you keep death at bay  Will you build wallswill you hidewill you run as far away as you canor will you pick up an axe and try to fight it  It doesnt matterdeath will find you in the endbut it will be a hell of a journey5 days into a rungood gear and foodhad me a working fuelled car My guy gets depressed from boredom Im sorry mate Since when does your video game character get sick of existing I went to swing a bat at a zombiebut due to my crap mood he swung too slowzombie jumped me and bit me I turned within a few days My character literally couldnt be bothered to save his own life 111Okay so here goes  I am a State Level Emergency Managerand I saw this game when I was recovering after a hospital stay  What they say they deliver not only is it a great game one of the only truly open ended games I have ever seen   It also follows pretty much what would happen theoretically during a wide scale Emergency Eventdrop some Mods onto it and the entire game gets a depth that I have not seen in other franchises  I have well over 2 hours played on this gamebut it needs to be said if you like a thought provoking gamewhere you will pay dearly for complaceny then this is the game for you  If you want a mindless game set in the zombie world then this is not the game for youala the Oregon Traill game in the early 9sdont make them again and you live longeri spent too long in this game No regretsOne or two years agoIm not sure whyI bought this gameprobably thinking thats a team of devs whose project I want to get behindthinking it was unplayable and would most likely never be finishedthe gameplay might scare you away but its efficient once you grasp the goals at hand just act with your best judgmentwhen I get there he tells me hes got attackedhes woundedhe got lost and bumped into an abbandoned lumber mill with solid metal doorsbandages

safe house and scavenge supplies to stay aliveso there is some character progressionI am even more stoked about this particular purchaseIf you get bitten Drink a bottle of bleach It cures the infectionTook 2 hours to survive a month on the hardest difficultythen died to 4 zombies at some gas stationquite possibly the greatest game Ive ever playedwe need 41 online modeReviewing this game feels like a daunting task  Theres so much I want to saythat I could write pages and pages on this gamebecause they enable lazy developers You dont need a storybut if you want one you can just rip off any established zombie lore Your AI can be barebones with zombies that just path to the nearest player and attack once they get into melee The lack of sophistication isnt a bugits a featureand so what if the pathfinding is easily exploited and theres no strategy at all  Theyre zombies Theyre supposed to be stupidsend wave after wave of zombies at the player and throw your shitty game up on Steam and hope someone buys it for 25 because they want trading cardsand the fact that it accomplishes that in an isometric 3rd person perspective is nothing short of amazing The way it limits your view to the direction your character is looking is done incredibly welland it even plays with that system a bitadjusting the viewing angle depending on your characters traitshealthand the visual conditionshow long they remember the player after you leave their line of sightand how fast they move  Some zombies are smart enough to path around obstacles and some will bang on the closed side of a double door even if the other door is open  This creates opportunities for the player to split up zombies by abusing these differences If theres a pack of 6 zombies you can slowly creep to them until a few notice youthen retreat and dispatch just those  Or if you have a big horde on youyou can run them through a building so some of them get stuck on windows and furnituregiving you spacing to take them out in smaller groupsbut rather a decision making based combat system  Wherewhen and how you fight matters a lot more than which weapon you have or what your characters stats are  An obese weakling can kill 1s of zombies under the right circumstances and a godlike character with max stats can die to a single zombie sneaking up behind themdistractionand discretion is the best way to surviveyoure just going house to housekilling zombies and raiding pantries for food  Eventually you master the combat system and positioning Youll live long enough for your character to experience exhaustion and fatigue and eventually youll learn to master those systemstoo Youll move onto base building and die to the helicopter the first time it happens Then you live long enough for water and power to fail Then you get to the point where all the easy places to loot are looted and you have to decide to try riskier placesor perhaps work on making your own food via farmingforagingor trapping Survive that longand the season will begin to change and with itnew problems Long term nutrition starts to matteras even if you are satisfying your characters hungerthey may be losing weight every day and in danger of wasting away Then winter hits Survive the winter and you can survive anythingno matter how long it takes  Its up to you  Just dont get too cockybecause no matter what youve built and how many zombies youve killedyou are always 1 bite away from joining their rankstheres more  Try challenge runs with negative traitsor crank up zombie numbers and infection chancesor even enable sprintersif you dare Dive into steam workshop and download mods to change the game or add new content Theres always another challenge to take onthe beta 41 version of the game the version you should be playing only has remote couch coop  This will eventually changehoweverand when it does multiplayer will open up a whole new dimensionProject Zomboid is a superb gamebut Id be remiss if I didnt point out some flaws  The game is still very much in early access development There are a few things about it and its systems that are a bit wonky as a result  A big criticism is how slow skills levelalthough in custom sandbox mode you can add an xp multiplier if you want towhereas electronics feels almost forgotten and theres very little reason to advance in it There arent any huge bugs Ive encounteredbut sometimes the interface can be a bit odd  Theres also a lack of polish sometimeslike for example there are no animations for sitting in a chair or sleeping in a bedthe rest of the game is so funso satisfying that its easy to overlook these thingsespecially because this is a 15 game by an indy developernot a 6 microtransactions AAA titleDont get me wrong its enjoyable when you play it alone too but I can trade a kidney and a leg for getting a mp updateKilled a zombie with a forkgot swarmed after and eaten by his buddies and lost my canned tunaStable build 4 61opt into the public

a few rough edgesbut the Devs are busting their butts to get everything working properly The gameplay is surprisingly addictingsometimes I look at the clock and wonder where the last 4 hours wentbut looking at my fort shows me where they wentMap Expansion that will certainly alter the current games play style No longer will we be limited to just raiding MuldraughWest Pointor the Newish Mall arearecent expansionwhich to be perfectly honest is quite a bit of looting to begin with It honestly necessitates a new SafehouseFortress for each area as carrying all the stuff you find between forts would be kind of pointlessas the current map is that bigmap link httppzmapcrashoverridenet and the planned additions of LouisvilleFort Knox and whatever lies in between them will make this a HUGE mapi love to get a Nailed Baseball Bat or an Axe and take on a horde or twojust swinging away till either the zombies are deadmy weapon breaksor i have to run and get bandaged upmaybe have my character drink some bleach if the zombies made me bleed Consequentlyi rarely have a character last much beyond a month in the game But thats the fun of the gameit lulls you into thinking that you are Too Good for the mere zombies to hurtuntil they get you surrounded and you remember that you swore to yourself last timethat you would not let that happen againtry it out for yourself and see how well you do Just remember the words on the screen at the beginning of the game This is how you diedwhich brought in a Medical Overhaul I have fallen out of windows and broken feet and legsrequiring me to bandage and splint the injuries then just wait for it to heal I have cut my hands climbing in thru broken windowshad to get some tweezers and pry out the lodged glass before bandagingpossibly having to stitch the wound Been scratched and bitten by zombiesrequiring me to disinfectstitchbandage the wound and hope i did not get infectedbefore i can do any of thisi had to locate the needed medical equipment at various locations on the map With the new overhaulits even possible to bleed out from a bad wound if i cannot locate some band aidsbandagesor even some sheets or clothing to rip up for use as a low grade bandage One nice thing is the ability to clean a bandage for reuseevery new build the Devs come up with just continues to draw you in and add more game immersionand they have plans to adjust the game to make it harder for you to survive a lengthy amount of timewith more and more Game Server companies starting to add PZ to their inventory  And i just realized i did not mention some of the other new things in the latest Build 33 We have more Sandbox options available when starting a new gameincluding adjusting how often Zombies respawnwhether or not you want random loot respawn and its frequencythe incredible Erosion mod has been integrated into the base game which literally is Mother Nature taking over the mapvines growing up buildingscracks in pavementtrees losing their leaves as fall approaches then regrowing as spring comesbushes and trees growing in places where we Humans would remove themSNOWand so much more that i just cannot think of right nowI dont want this to be a 1 word review so ill stop here but as beforeif you would like to see some gameplay there are plenty of videos on youtube Orcheck on Twitch  and catch a live stream Either wayI hope you enjoy what you see and you too join the Zomboid communitystill enjoying most of it damn zombiesand yes you can indeed rally a 2 door sports car at about 12MPH head on into a tree to smash a zombiebut yer gonna die

still needs a lot of workresourceful and careful In many casesnot scouting out and planning your approach could very easily mean your death Zombies are a real threat here the smallest scratch can be

the way you like in the sandbox mode Live in the zombie apocalypse you wantwith the world rules you want Don’t like that the water and electricity shut off after a few weeks Change it Don’t like the way the zombie virus is spread Change it Maybe you’re a fast runner Left 4 Dead type zombie lover good luck you crazy bastard or maybe you like the slow but intelligent zombies that open doors and like to watch you sleep… All up to youthe man that thinks before he does and the man that cries himself to sleep at night If you are any of those things… This game is a thrill to playbut I’m sure it’ll be a blastEarly game oh god what was that noise oh god oh fuckmake build 41 multiplayerRemember how DayZ was described as a gritty zombie survival game with challenging gameplay and real intense moments that burn into your brain because of how good it isYou should play this game Its definitely not Resident Evil And that is a good thing Seriously You even have a demo available Play itwho has only a few hours invested in the game ordering you around Wellthat is not exactly true I played this game a lot a while back when it was still on Desura and I think I really can give you guys an objective opinion hereyet i always thought this is the game that zombie fans deserved Its not some cheerful sit with your friends and giggle while blowing zombie heads off game like Left 4 Dead series were I meani like L4Dbut it never got right what i really wanted off an zombie game Its also not wannabe scary and atmospheric horror game like Resident Evil thats in the end just funnyespecially with the addition of coop in RE5 which has broken every last bit of atmosphere that Resident Evil 1 and 2 had Seriously if you havent play the old Resident Evilsthey are goodin the aspect that both of them make you feel like a masochist and that both of them consist of learning by trial and error By fireand zombies even with their fixed and upgraded AIs feel more like an annoyance then a threatwhile in Project Zomboid many times i died just because some zombie slowly shambled 3 meters behind me and i forgot to dispatch it before it came to my house It broke my window and in the middle of the night hell broke loosewhere you will evolve from a guy that runs around with a butter knife and tries to kill as much zombies as possible before dying a slow and painful deathto a guy that silently scavenges whole blocks of buildingsand knows how not to take unnecessary risksthat is just one more reason to try this game out Alsokeep in mind that multiplayer is also in its early stagesbut for me it worked like a charmand that the game doesnt really instruct you that much about all the dangers of the worldand believe methey are manynot just another action game that includes zombies Butalso i have to mention a really friendly and awesome community over at game forums that will answer most of your questions and help you in any way possibleon the other handlooking for a closest thing to an zombie apocalypse simulatoryou have to at least download the demo and try the game Its a wonderful game with many details that make it really atmospheric and easy to immerse yourself into
1,Still the best Battlefield multiplayer to dateplayed this for over 500h on PS4the Steam version installs an older version of Punkbusterthe anticheat software used for the multiplayer of this game As suchyou might get kicked from multiplayer sessions after a minute or sotheres an easy fix for thatZIP or similar programsclick Add Gamethe game path should be filled in automaticallyyou can close the pbsetup and should be able to play on multiplayer servers without getting kicked I hope you have as much fun with the multiplayer as I did Always remember to spot enemiesplay the objective and revive your teammatesspawn on top of skyscraperEven Battlefield 2042 cannot beat this masterpiecebetter than bf5Im playing it in 2021and still amazing So much ahead of his timeultra mega fun game unless you are going up against sweats in helis getting 100 kill streaksUse the refund money from 2042 to buy thisI bought this game back in 2014 at a GameStop My goal was to buy Cod 4but with the game being  years old at the timeI didnt find itI found this game for the 360 Even though I didnt have internet at the timeI played hundreds of hours out of the campaign because of how good the gun play wasI finally got internet and was able to play online I was overjoyed as I didnt even expect the online to be as good as it was I never went backthe game still lives on and stands the test of time with hundreds of servers still being activethe weapon balance is greatand there is a use case for each different one The graphics still hold up to todayand there are many players still activebut also because of just how damn good it ispulling off rewarding strategiesand well balanced gun playyou should pick up this gameThey dont make shooters like this anymoreOne of the best FPS of all time Servers are still good if not better in 2020h1 A somewhat Helpful Review h1open it up and click on “add game” Make sure BF4 is installed or it might not workbut once you add it boom Issue fixed That took like what2 minutes For those who wrote lazy reviews you could’ve spent your time actually trying to fix it quickly Any other questions just comment on my profile Can’t link punkbuster website cause it’ll get removedI aswell as others I talked to did not have this issue so I do not know how to fix it I recommend doing research and if I find a solution I will add it above The only possible solution I can think of is completely uninstalling punkbuster than manually reinstalling itbut yet this is not guarenteed to workyou need to install origin But does that really matter It’s 8 for BF4  ALL DLCS You also get 61 battle packs if you careat least I did It took me no longer than 3 god damn minutes to setup originyou don’t even need to use it afterwards Just launch it through steamboth platforms are linked anywaydo some research on BF4 playcounts in your areas They may be significantly lower You will have NO problem finding a full 64 player match Specific DLC maps you might have an issue with as most are not as popular Most popular servers are Conquest Large on base maps Don’t go for quick play and immediately go for the server browser I personally have not found a server that lied to be about its playercount but if you do just test out all the servers and favorite legit ones so you can find them laterthat’s what ide dothe game takes up roughly 68GB instead of 30GB as they basically just mashed the DLCs into the premium edition Not sure why it says 30 when its obviously drastically offbasically just more maps to mess around withif you’ve never played battlefield your first few games will be hell but once you get used to it its all good I recommend only running campaign if you got spare time or are achievement hunting Don’t get me wrong its not a bad campaign by any means but its nothing breathtaking eitherdo not buy it on steam if you already have it on Originif there are any mistakes I made please comment down belowit is the 4th game where you battle on a fieldIts nice to go back to when times were simpler and you would argue with your friends over which was bettercod or battlefield Now theyre both crap At least this is still enjoyableI have a 000001 kdr but hot damn is this game fun24 Operation Lockerstill really active 5 full servers in nzaustralia def would recomendBetter than sexh1bWaitwhat iBattlefield 4i is still alivebh1I still find it hard to believe that this firstperson shooter is already eight years old It almost feels like yesterday when I hopped in a match with a group of friendsso we could try to win the battle with our dumb yet hilarious tactics Sometimes we were successfulsometimes notbut one thing was constant  — we had a great time ThusI was naturally curious to see whether my thoughts and memories about those times are still valid or if they got influenced by socalled nostalgic thinkingI hooked up with an old friend of mineand we both ventured back into the chaotic skirmishes as if it was the last chance to say our farewells to this title Howeverwe were surprised that iBattlefield 4’si servers are still full of joy and life Thousands of people are still playing it to this very dayand the player count got even higher after the announcement of the upcoming iBattlefield 2042ithe best time to jump in again is nowso I am more than familiar with the game’s mechanics It also explains why most of my achievements unlocked at one specific time because they carry over You can click urlhttpsgyazocome121f8058ac99aef09abde5cc8ebaf6bhereburl to see the proof of my spent timeit is not necessary to play iBattlefield 4i via the iBattlelogi app anymoreas there is an ingame server browser Howeverwe experienced few problems at timesas it did not put us in the same squadso we had to do it manuallyquotewe managed to find lots of populated servers for several modesmaps and expansions Neverthelesssome of the less favoured game modessuch as Defuse or Capture the Flagmight have only one or two active matches It is possible to play them at timesbut the franchise’s iconic Conquest is way more popularand you will not have a problem finding servers for it Servers’ activity is visible at any time on the abovementioned urlhttpsbattlelogbattlefieldcombf4servers iBattlelogiurl pageso you can check out how the modes you might want to play are doingand while it looks quite authentic to the modern settingthere are still a lot of inaccuracies This game is about jumping in and experiencing chaotic skirmishes without thinking much about it If you want something more sophisticatedyou should check out iARMAi or iSquadithe Chinese presence spices it up Thusthis setting provides varied maps from several locationswhether it is the city of ShanghaiSiberian mountains or islands in the Pacific Oceanwe are not here for sightseeingas those locations will taste the horrors of war soon The environmentmainly buildingsare destructiblewhich changes the gameplay a bit Did the enemy squad hide in that shack over there Why go inside for the possible death when you can blow it up There is even a socalled iLevolutioni system that usually changes the game’s pace For examplesunny weather might change into a stormwhich will worsen your vision and even makes higher wavesinfluencing boats’ movementyou have to focus on your objectives As Conquests is this series’ iconic and most popular modeI will describe it a bit Both teams have a high respawn ticket numberlike 1 000 To win the matchyou have to lower your opposing team’s tickets down to zero That is done either by killing enemiesas each death – respawn – takes one ticket because that would be a bit slowthere are several objective zonesusually fivefor you to capture If you happen to control more of themenemies’ tickets reduce faster Due to this system and the fact that there can be up to sixtyfour playersthere are several ongoing battles at one moment Thusyou have to choose where your presence might be most helpfulpeople can join in squadswhich allows you to respawn on your comrades and cooperate a bit If two squads are already on their way towards the objective Echogo to another one There is also a commander role it is not present on the actual battlefieldas it can only watch the whole map and support its team with various tools or even unleash missiles upon enemies Commander’s presence is not necessary to winbut it surely is a sweet bonus to have onetools and equipmentit would be a bit tedious to describe all of themespecially as they are all customizable InsteadI will focus on the classes There are four of themsuch as explosives or smokeswhich are deadly for enemies infantry They can also heal others and revive fallen comradesas well as repairing allied onesmaking them deadly assassinsmortar strikesand their machine guns are always ready to tear apart your foeslistsuch as shotguns or DRMsare even available to all My personal favourite is definitely the engineer classas with A91 carbineit is efficient against the infantrytoo Plusannoying others’ vehicles is something I love to doyou can obliterate several lonely soldiers with a tankbut you automatically become a target for others Apart from that onethere are various transportsboatshelicopters and jets all of those have different types according to map and factioncompared to other franchiseslike iCall of Dutyiwhich manages to provide enjoyableaction momentsit is still mediocre The story and characters are blandgeneric and unmemorable What is worse is the fact that AI is simply dumbespecially your companions’ onewhich ruins the immersionarcadey shooterwhich puts you into chaotic encountersthen iBattlefield 4i is the right choice for you With its active player base and tons of contentyou cannot go wrong For methis my

1,I once lost all my colonists in Surviving Mars Two hundred men and womenadultschildren and elderly They had pets It was due to an unfortunate chain of events and gross incompetence on my part It felt nowhere as bad as when I lost all my 12 beavers to a droughtworkingand good It deserves to be enjoyed and its developers deserve to be supportedMy original beaver colony was doing absolutely amazing Was up to 96 beaversproducing metalbooksalmost everything in the tech tree Several droughts had come and gone but I barely noticed them with how well my dam and water supplies held out And then the big one camea drought that lasted just a little bit longer than I was ready for The dam dried up The water stopped pumping My little guys were drinking from the reserves until thosetooran dry A day and a half before the drought ended beavers started to die from dehydration As some died it made room in the housesand they started having babies The next generation ready to take over after the drought But it went for just too long In the last hours of the droughtmy last adult beaver died off The river came back though And the 8 babies had survived it The ran around like crazyplaying on the carouselchasing each other down the streets Working up a big thirst Butnone of them were big enough to pump the water They were growing fast thoughwould they become adults in time As the day went the dehydration started to hit them hard and the first died off The others ran around in a panicworking up a bigger and bigger thirstuntil they too fell to the groundlicking the sand for any little bit of moisture it might have As night fell on the second day after the drought the town lay still and quiet No one at the campfiresno one in the rooftop terracesand no one working the pumps in the pump housesTLDRso there are issues related to itas it isit is rather a zenlike gamewhere you just happily build loads of housing complexesthat may not be efficientbut they just look niceand there arent many I really hope more are getting added later in the developmentbecause I see huge potential for deeper gameplaycalled districts Then make them transfer stuff and pop from one to another This is nicebut having to research the distribution outpost and the receiving outpost separatelyseems like a mistakeas these buildings are absolutely useless without one another and thats very telling of the current state of Research in the game  redundant and frustrating I am pretty sure Ive seen the dev response somewhere mentioning Research is getting a reworkbutId just straight up disable it until the rework is done As it stands nowthe research is just an extra layer that makes you build things in a way you dont likeuntil you get things like platforms and bridgestaking away A LOT of the joy you couldve had in the early to mid game Research is done through a single buildingyoure expected to spam It requires no resources and no energyjust one beaver and that feels pretty dumb and unsatisfying Id expect research to open up ways in which you can certain thingslikewindmills instead of water wheels I get that you dont need a windmillbut it may be situationally better buildinghence available though research What I dont get is locking simple wooden platformsand thing like the Forester building behind research You absolutely need foresterand you can also pretty much softlock yourself if you kill all the forests without having built the foresterwhich seems pretty stupid Wooden platforms and stairs are essential to any fun you can get from buildingso those should be absolutely available from get go  Youve already got mechanics that stop you from building advanced buildings to start withsuch asdifferent materials Research as it is currently implemented is just redundantunsatisfying and frustrating Its also easy to tell there wasnt much development time spent on its current implementationbut there are no swimming or underwater mechanics theres even a hamster wheel as power source I really hope they add some beaver mechanics related to water beside few different types of damsjust let me unless its limited by the engine or smth The outpost mechanics would flourish in huge worldstheyre easily beat by a few dams and water storage spamdamaging dams if the flotsam is travelling at higher speed  need for flotsam breakerswater speed control  there needs to be a punishment for slowing the water too much  water Power wheels need to scale with water flow speedcurrent implementationwhere you put water power wheel into stale water and somehow it generates 180pwr seems very offother conservation methods Spoiled food  fertilizer  extra production in future as balance set off similar effect to beehiveFlag with x storage for fertilizereffect in y radiusspoil rate  1  amount

vegetation as food source  vegetation grows on the riverbed  potential for purposeful drying of parts of the riverto collect loads of food from the riverbed quicklyor long term diving posts essentially a Flag next to river Water vegetation would just grow on the riverbed over timemaking it yet another food sourcebut the housing would be very resource heavyrequiring powermultiple beaversand research specific resources Example If you wanna research a windmillyou need a bunch of cogsplanks and woodand X amount of timewhich can be divided by the amount of hamsters working in the particular lab  butmore hamsters working means more Power required The building would need to ding once research was doneor no research was in progressrequiring extra input from the player by making him choose the next research But I dont see that as an issueas the game isnt exactly micro heavy They could probably slap that on top of a research treebut reallythey need more buildings for that sort of thing70 of the buildings available should be considered essential and unlocked from the start so like but I am fine with any other solution that doesnt completely suck as well thoughId like to list a couple of extra suggestionsas it seems about right What doesnt seem about right is the lack of compensation techniquesminimum 0 no windwithin 400 power required system As it is nowyou might as well end up with 60 efficiency due to lows and zeroeseven though your system provides more than enough average power Energy produced outside of working hours is also getting wastedyou could just make mid sizedhollow wooden wheels filled with water with a piece of plywood across the insidesso you wouldnt get the water spinning independently to the wheel and lose a bunch of kinetic energy to fluid friction These would work essentially as any other power consuming buildingwith a twistbeingit only consumes Power when the system has extraand the other way around  being a power source when the system lacks powerwhile having given max power stored capacity and max power provided stats These stats could be realistically given by max tolerated stresses inside the transmissions and mechanics of the inertia battery Switching between modes could be done by centrifugal transmissions  soit should make sensehence giving them water consumption and making them more interactivethat might help the water gameplayare water pumps and pipes Think they would be funbut very much a work in progressrather short on content Meaning its not really a complex strategy game yet Butthe mechanics and graphics currently present in the game beside Researchwhich should be temporarily disabled until reworkedimoare solid enough to make it a fun zen gamewhere you just build stuff and enjoy looking at the beavers go ham I see great potential on what it could becomeI hope the devs wont disappoint So far it seems like theyve been very responsive to the feedbackwhich is also one of the main reasons Ive bought into this early accessYou can unlock the camera and zoom in really close to the ground to see the cute little beavers carrying stuff on their backsThis is a game about a beaver society It is my civic duty as a Canadian to buy and play it It is goodI bought Timberborn as soon as it came outlost my mind on how cute the Beavers areand suddenly Ive now been playing for over 21 hours in a single sessionbut also challengingwhile at the same time offering a lot of interesting options to manage risks and systems collapseeventually Im going to need to sleepbut over 500 beavers need my guiding hand to expand ever furtherstill not sleptIve crawled the fps down to 7 when at triple speedwhich means Im winning Over 500 beavers5 districtslooking at a 6th and 7th soonIve churned the ground to make deep trenches irrigating the vast majority of the barren landsand run power using great lengths of cranks and shafts spanning huge distances in totalbecause my waterway Management at this point has  enabled me to supply the land with water even through the 710 day droughts the game now throws at mebut with some extra clever additions that do nothing but add to the game D the game will punish youbut you will succeedand by Lumber make your mark1010even in EA I approve DIt took me 10 hours to realize that the beavers can swimI kept spending lots of lumber on bridges and dams specifically to get across shallow pools of wateronly to realize hours later that beavers canin factswimCanadians Im from CaliforniaIts difficult not to draw parallels to Banished when reviewing Timberborn It is clear that the developers have taken significant inspiration from the older game everything from game mechanics to the difficulty curve are nearly identical The way both games have you balancing your resources are very similarhaving to prioritize between the basic needs of your people and the gathering and replanting of resources so your community can expand Timberborn does add one additional layer to the gameplay with mechanics centered around the river stray more than a few blocks from its borders and the land turns arid and deadunable to support the plants you need to survive This is used as a central resource in Timberborn use up all the green area for plants and you wont have anywhere to place your water wheels to extract power from the flowing water Fail to prepare for the dry season and your society will collapse as the riverand the land around itdries up Where Banished had you stocking up for the winterTimberborn has you stocking up and building dams to buy precious days of fertile land into the dry seasonhaving been just released into early access is already almost as polished and complete as Banished was near its end While it only took me around 6 hours to explore to the end of the current tech treethe base game and the underlying mechanics are incredibly solid and bug free for being so early in the developmentand the content that is here is already well worth the price I am excited to see where the devs take Timberborn give it time and it will become an incredible colony simThis is what canada actually looks likeTimberborn stands out from other survival settlement builders through its use of water management and its villagers being beaversof course By which I mean it is necessary as part of the core mechanics to build and maintain dams in order to control the flow of waterat first in order to survive the seasonal droughtsbut then also to begin to divert river flow to bring life to dry areas of the game mapas it handles pretty nicely and whilst not fully without issueis very well polished But past the early gametheres not a whole lot to doit speed up researchyoull want a larger colony and to maintain a larger colonyyoure going to want to research more advanced conceptswhich are going to require new resources as you bridge the tiers And to be fairthere are a decent number of upgrades available through research Enough that the core game is certainly there and in a complete statebut ideally there could be more Certainlythere is more to it than Banishedwhich is the typical yardstick people measure this kind of game against these daysyouve built a huge lake thatll retain water throughout even the longest of droughts without risking the death of your crops Now what There isnt much incentive to expandexcept maybe to scavenge for scrap metal You can easily reach the end of the research tree on maybe  districts alone And when you doyoull be left thinking now whatgreat core ideas and a robust game engine but not a whole lot to do after a fact Yesthere are multiple factionsbut right now there are only 2 of thoseand whilst they do play differently enough it does increase increase replayabilitytheyre not different enough to make that second playthrough interesting once youve gotten used to those differences It is my hope that Timberborn will fix these aspects before it leaves Early Accessbecause it really does have the potential to stand up there with games like the Anno series It just needs some fleshing out to get thereHonestly Went into this pretty well actually blind entirely and I must sayHoly Crap this is a good game Extremely fun just to start over and over until you get that good start that you want You should give this a shot if you love city builders This honestly so off guard I just simply had to write a review to share my thoughts on what is currently an extremely enjoyable experienceThank you for your time  have a great dayI am completely in love with this game Colony sims are one of my favorite genresand having one with no combat focused on hydro engineering and irrigation starring adorable sapient beavers is just wonderfuland still allow you to place building blueprints on stuff marked for demolition  having to manually delete paths is particularly annoyingeg so you can find all your gatherers huts to pause themso feel free to skip the restbut this game just has me excited at the future possibilitiesmaybe for other factionscattailswaterlillies or somethingwhere the entrance can be placed underwater but the top is above water and resists flooding unless totally submergedand to have a horsepowerenhanced advanced research building that worked fasterthis would help a lot with making wind and water power more steady in the late game Most colony sims have you researching batteriesand mechanical energy storage solutions seem fitting for both the genre and the settingh1A City Builder with a Storyh1Ancient Citiesand Nebuchadnezzar But it gets right what a lot of other games miss There is an ease of play to the mechanics that make it seem like a more developed game The devs thought of a lot of what the gamer would need It is already perfectly playable in its current state The story background is an apocalyptic future where the beavers outsurvive the humans There are ruins scattered around the mappresumably from the fallen human civilizationsas well as a need for basic resources to build withlike wood and metal scraps I already get a deepermore visual feel for the way the water cycle works than anything you can get from just reading books Good models are like thatwhich I do love I love the ability to shape the land and use dynamite I love being able to edit and create my own maps I am also enjoying the trading elements of being able to trade between districts The whole district component is a fun part of the gamemost importantlyI would love the addition of a workshop to play maps that other gamers create and share I think that multiplayer competitive and cooperative could be perfectly doable in this game in the future I also could see the addition of scenarios which I dont care for very much myself in a game Butsome people like that I certainly look forward to more maps and BIGGER maps Its all goodits well worth the money spentsince I already have over 80 hours in the first week and a half since release I cant quit playing I highly recommend this game for people who love city buildersI rarely leave reviewsbut Im making the effort here because Timberborn is hands down best Early Access game since Factorio IMOYMMVbut actually managing a seasonal and limited water budget  There are no shortcuts around it  While this might sound a bit tediousit makes for an absorbingly refreshing twist on colony management sims  The fact that its only in EA means that the game can only get betterI had exactly zero glitches playing this game  Researchexpansionand planning are all integral parts of the game  Like any good colony simthere are a ton of ways for things to go off the rails  In this game more than mostlong range planning will pay offwhile I think the the game has a well developed early and earlymid gametheres not much in the way of a lategame feel  I like colony simsresource management sims where there is a clear transition along the lines of survival  establishment  incremental expansion  administrativelogistic mastery  technological mastery  environmental mastery  monument achievement  FactorioRimworldKSPand a few others have this progressive feel  Timberborn sorta halts at incremental expansionand the clearest win condition that I can see is for the player to completely overcome drought as a limiting factor for survivalexpansion  The fact that this game is still in EA means that there is a chance that his might be addressed as the devs continue to work on the game  I want to underlinethoughthat this critique is not a black mark for the game at all it is the opposite  Despite higher levels of gameplay not really existing at least in terms of my model abovethe game remains engaging and fulfilling  Within the bounds of the gamethe only real limit is your imagination and ingenuityand possibly only important to me because I am a water resources professional there are some concepts of water resources management that could be implemented but the devs either havent gotten there or have decided not to go there  Some of these concepts are mechanical automated weir crestsdam bottom outletswater pumpsetc  In the case of water pumpsthere is a strong chance that the devs might be afraid that a water pump would make the game vulnerable to infinite energy exploitation though I can see ways around that as well that would not involve rejiggering game physics   In those other casesI hope to see the devs release them as new features in the future  Other concepts would take more effort to introduce to the game pollutiongroundwaterevaporation managementseasonalityoceanwatersalinityetcTimberborn wholeheartedly deserves the overwhelmingly positive reviews it has received in the first two weeks since its EA release  It presents all the colony sim challenges that buildergamers like me craveand does it with a twist that is unique in my experience  I very much look forward to continuing to play this gameand I cant wait to see where the devs go with this most excellent gameI fucking love this game Its simple once you get it1 hours total 22 hours latest gameI fiddled around with the mechanics learned how things worked 5 tries later bingo I have a rather well balanced buildjust hitting metalI have been gaming 42 years since I was 8and am a DevOps Engineer so you know I like tidy processesI really like what you have here for an early access game UXUE is pleasing refinement of the bar I am sure will comeother than that I have a stable  district sharing resources setupabout to grind out metal But I just wanted to give you guys some love from the game so farwhatever they are the type that whine about the rd pixel in the title of the loading screen is offset incorrectly when you are at max 50k resolutionI have a few friends playing and even the girlfriend She loves this shit Its a Good wholesome game with the foulest of jokes about wet beavers I appreciate your art and decent fun I look forward to seeing how this all plays outSatisfactory 456 hrs minus pioneer time from EpicDyson Sphere Project 868 hrsNo game has scratched my itch for a new Banished quite like Timberbornwith different mechanics such as the drought and HP to make it freshI was here when the Beaverlike citybuilder genre was bornWow  Fastest tutorial ever The game pretty leaves you to explore everything by yourselfwater tanksalways build more water tanksI got the hang of it First the few points that I think need to be improvedbut it would make way more sense if the door was on the opposite sidebut it feels very weird and unintuitive Also doesnt it defeat the purpose of having to build your shaft pipelines Plus some of these buildings dont even have a shaft connection point at allso you can only power them up via another adjacent buildingand how I can reproduce it Is it controlled by the amount of population Something else Its not clear for me when I need to make new districts to expand and when I dontbut I need to build a whole set of transportdeposit buildings in both directions and set various routes to ensure the little number of castors will surviveand then I need to micromanage the workers in this district because some will die of old age and the district will be too small to have a natality that makes up for it So I very regularly need to manually migrate castors to replace the dead It would be better if the workers of the district centers or the transport buildings could just transport resources when they are not doing other stuffand if I could set some automigration rulessay unemployed castors from my main district could automigrate to fill vacant jobs in other districts Im not sure exactly how but I feel this part of the game could and should be simplifiedbecause the game lets me build itbut not detonate itespecially when you have built more stuff upon itthe game is a massive timesinkbridgesplatformsD building Just wowseveral stories construction it becomes invaluable to check where you should build new shortcuts for your castors and optimize transportationbut if the water goes away you dont even have to repair themshaping a bit of terrain with dynamite takes some time Alsopaper alone can make dynamite Hmmm Go geoengineer yourself a big pond to survive the droughtwhere workers could dig through dirt Of course it would be way slower than dynamitebut it would allow to shape some early little ponds and canalsand Im not asking for a fullfledged campain à la Annobut Id like my beavers to work to something else than just having their needs fulfilled For instancein a game like Frostpunk I was always feeling I was going somewherelike narratively speakingthat I wasnt just bulding stuff just for the beauty of itand the devs already implemented water physics Of course full weather management snow and everything would be even better but I know theres something as asking too much I feel like a kid on a water playground againFarmPumpSurvive The level of industry is quite small and long production chains are the exception like Timber Logs  Planks  Paper  Explosives The real star are the water mechanics They are simple to understand but have surprisingly much depth hehethat by the way for me was completely bugfreeits a game that i very much enjoy even in its current statewith some spread out intense moments to ithigher Damsfloodingdirty waterDam
1,Im going to try to describe the game and also translate the hate youll read about the gameto give you an idea of what to expect from my point of viewits true In many casesits only true for those who have played literally all the content already and have no concept of reality for a new playerand how updates suck compared to the pastthe game is updated less often than it used to be updated It still gets new content every month at a minimum Many players will say Well THIS new content isnt REAL content because it doesnt match the content those players wish existedthe games pretty packed with it There are a decent number of quests While most MMOs have thousands of quests that consist of Kill 0 wolves Runescape does not Runescape uses its quests for stories Some of those stories are exceptionally well madesome of which are used for combatyou may not enjoy itJagexhas definitely had several problems There is a lot of outdated content in the game that could use a fresh coat of paint at the very least Very little of this will affect your gameplay as a new playerone mechanic that Runescape is lacking multiple characters Runescape has a one character  one account setup You cannot create multiple characters per single membership The only exception to this is that you can have one character in the modern Runescape 3 gameand one character in Old School Runescapewhich is an alternative version of Runescape based on how the game played around 2007 it IS still updated and maintainedits not just an unsupported relicbut if you like to roll multiple charactersyoull have to pay the membership fee for each characterthe subredditthe steam forumsthe Runescape sites forumsthat one random guy you know that knows everythingand that other random guy you know that knows nothingtheyre not paytowin For the most partmost of the outrage youll see about them is simply that they exista massive amount of the outrage is generated by people who have played Runescape for over a decadedesperately miss the game they once hadand believe that literally anything and everything different is going to kill Runescapethe chances of the microtransactions negatively affecting you are slim If youve played literally any other MMOor just about any game released in the last decadeyou probably wont notice anything out of the ordinary If thats a bad thing to youfair enoughrun away or dont I started playing in 2005and quit in 202 I came back in 204and quit in 205just to come back in 206 and quit in 207 And now Im back You dont escapeyou just take breaksdo not go to the Runescape subreddit There are some good postsand you might see some good information about the game For the most part thoughthe only people left that browse the subreddit regularly are the most diehard fans that hateplay Runescapelatch onto anything and everything bad the company doesand spam about how microtransactions are ruining the game Ohalso several people that wont hesitate to tell you constantly how This is why I quit playing years ago  Its also the type of subreddit that makes up roughly 00 of the playerbasebut unironically believes it accurately represents the will of the average playersand form your own opinion Even Im biased Its impossible to play the game for literal years without being biasedthats awesome If you dontits understandableWhile writing this review I stand at 7926 hours spent on RuneScape 900 hours on the Steam version and just got the Master Quest Cape after over 5 yearsI was 0 and I didnt even speak englishI learned it entirely thanks to this gameRuneScape really outshines eveyone in that aspectI think nostalgia helped a lot in keeping me goingI even met the devs and the original creators I played this game with all my friends be it at homeon the middle school librarys computerduring college classes or even at work and I dont regret a single minute of it It has been a pleasure Ill probably log in now and then to look at what new content will eventually come out but I am finally doneeven if you often tend to mess things upI still owe you a big part of my childhood Thank you for the good timesPicture this youve just finished school As you say farewell to your friends at the gates you speak the wordsSee you on World 08  Life is rich with excitement and adventure and you feel a sense of peace within yourself You leave school with a grin on your face

be perfect but it fills that void in your heart For nowthank you for years of excitementyears of happiness and year of funfriends h2bIntroductionbh2Runescape 3 and Old School Runescape I will introduce OSRS in this review aswell Both games have a very stable and high player base This version of the game is Runescape 3 I personally play both games because they are very different from each other and offer different content such as bosses and raids Both games are really enjoyable This review is made about Runescape 3you can only exchange them for membership They can be bought for real money or for in game money from other playersbut if you want to unlock all content you need to get yourself membership Membership can be bought for around 89 a month You can also obtain membership by buying a bond with in game money More about bonds in the section below If you purchase membership on your account you are member on Runescape 3 and on OSRSbank slotspets etc I do not consider this shop pay to win The only real functional things are bank slots and legendary pets Legendary pets can have 3 abilities For example picking items up when defeating monsters These pets are not OPthe abilities have cooldowns Which means if you kill monsters not every item will end up in your inventoryrangeprayer and summoningwith this combat style you are close to the enemy and fighting with your swordhammer or maul for example Second combat style is magic With this combat style you can be further away from the enemy and you will be casting spells with your wand or staff The third combat style is ranged With this combat style you can also be further away from your enemy You will be shooting arrows with your bow or throwing knifes or axes The monsters in Runescape have different weaknesses All combat styles are based around abilities that you can use The higher the lvl the more abilities you can usefor example go bossingraidsquest together and so much moreEveryone know you never quit Runescape You just take long breaksplayed this game since i was  never stopped dont plan on it no one ever quits runescape they just take breaksIf you like to never go outside and if you only want to play the same game for 2h a day then this is for youits been a whole year since hes touched a woman God bless his soulwould let it steal my friend againWhen I was but a wee ladI had not a care in the worldeating my vegetablesand building up the courage to fight Elvarg and earn my Rune Platebody privilegesI like to go backSo Ive been around this game sence 200I have always loved this game This game has a personal story to me In the year 2002I was still very low leveledkilling goblins and trying to quest I was young and dumb Finally came the time I needed to buy a rune axe Hatchet as they call it now I sold almost all the fish  wood and gear I had Wasnt much but it was big to meI begged for gold for 3 days and when I was about to give up One player came up to measked me what I needed the gold for And I said I want to cut trees better He said Hm Gave me a Rune Pickaxe  Rune Axe and simply said Maybe one day youll do the same for someone elsegoodluck kid I looked down at my keyboard and cried cause I hadnt been treated that way before And its 202 now and I still have that same pickaxe and hatchet he gave me And with his little helpshowed me being generous is more rewarding to me than just building power for myself alone So I created a Motto Everyone deserves a hand in lifebad or goodrich or poor  Runescape is definitely a wonderful placeGame is grind Grind waste time Waste time goodSometimes I just sit at my deskstaring at my character at a bankrealizing its been over 5 years since I first play this gameRuneScapeHello darkness my old friendIf you get membership status on one of the RuneScapesit counts for both of themhuTLDRuhthen I can recommend RS3 Ironman as a solid experience worth trying In typical RuneScape fashionthe game is freetoplay but 90 of the content is locked to purchasing membershipso I would recommend that you do so to fully experience the gamethe RS3  bad petty meme made by diehard Old School RuneScape fans is just that a meme When the game first became a thing in 202 with the Evolution of Combat EOC updateit was very janky and poorly introduced In present daythe games combat and gameplay is largely more refined and less convoluted to usethough admittedly still a bit new playerunfriendlyyou are thrust into the world of Gielinor to explore at your leisure You can participate in various activities such as leveling up your skillsslaying monsters for loot and experienceand completing queststasks to obtain unique account upgrades In contrast to Old School RuneScapeRS3s combat system is based on abilities and adrenaline There is a lot more that needs to be learned about the combat system than can be said in hereso I would recommend that you check out a few outside resourcesvideos to better understand itIronman mode avoids paytowin progressionyou are forced to do everything yourself if you want gearitem upgrades then you will have to do activities yourself until the items drop instead of immediately buying them from another player The mode forces you out of the comfort zone and opens you up to exploring the game and figuring out new methods to reach goals and to possibly experience content that you had never heard of or wanted to try out With Ironman modenearly everything you do has a purpose rather than having a goal of making enough money to buy somethingalbeit some activities might be considered deadcontent but the newer content is actually more engaging and often more rewarding to do Just to name a few that have released recently Big Game Hunter is basically training the Hunter skill by skillfully navigating around an arena to take down enormous dinosaur creaturesand the new Anachronia agility course is different from the old  outdated standard courses in that it is broken up into sectionstakes upwards of 6 minutes to fully completeand awards very high experience rates when skillfully navigated There is a lot of content to get lost in within the game and I appreciate thatbut there are still some older areas in the game that have not been graphically updated to meet the newer area aesthetics In terms of equipmentgear typically looks better as you progress up from the early tiers to the later tiersI dont care one bit about the story and I spacebar through all questgame dialogue because I really dont like the idea of walking up and talking to the gods in a regular conversation Admittedlyif you are a lore nut and enjoy learning about the history of the gamethen there is a lot for you to dive intoyou can experience many substories in the form of quests and Elite Dungeons in the later part of the gamepartially due to the fact that the developers dont need to poll the players on their opinions about every single piece of planned contenteven without paytowin or bonusexpweekends Generallyyou reach your skill goals faster and move on towards more exciting content at a quick pace instead of tryharding your way to achieve maximum efficiency by 2ticking something on OSRSbut when you do figure them out it is pretty good even though it still relies on tickbased actions Particularly for movementit is a blast to zoom around the map quickly with Double Surge and the mobile perkbut the devs havent really punished themyou are constantly bombarded with MTX promotions and salesthe game can quickly becomes a list of daily choresbut there is no thirdparty client to play RS3 on to enhance your quality of lifebut there are barely any substantial updates to support ant PvPbut some older content does appear to get more outdated and irrelevant as time goes on Nonethelessthere is a lot to do in the game and you can sink thousands of hours into it and still have a fun timeI only wrote this review for awards is a waste of everyones time If you are interested in genuine  detailed game reviewsfeel free to check out my others buurlhttpssteamcommunitycomidbonafidemonafiderecommendedhereurlub or dontI dont tell you what to dohbYou never quit Runescapeyou just take a break from itbhsteam doesnt format this review properly so click on the blue thumbs up next to my name to read it with better formattingthere are buTWO VERSIONS OF RUNESCAPE PRESENTubwhere Jagex basically found an old copy of Runescape 2 back from 2007and they chose to continue making updates onwards from that clone before the controversial updates that are currently present in Runescape 3or maybe even RS RS classicyour character will be transferred herelike mine wasit felt extremely overwhelming to get started with at first From having 28 skills to level fromall the way to having 227 quests at the time of writing this revieweach varying in how long they could be and having very interesting lore PersonallyI enjoy the quests in RS3 compared to some other MMOs because there is more to them then simplyKill 5 cows orPick up 5 flowers There is enough content and variety here to keep you entertained for hours on end Theres a reason to do these quests toosince they may unlock new powerful abilitiesor gain new items to equipand the reason for killing them could be for moneycollecting a specific item if you are an ironmanor going after pets which are basically companion collectiblesalthough everybody might not care about it The vast amount of lore you can find within this game is fantasticsome being much better then others Not interested in the lore No problemjust hold spacebar through every quest and skip every cutscene and youll be fine Whether or not you know the lore to the game is insignificant as to how you will play and level your statsno matter how long or how short it isit feels satisfying just to eventually hit it Going after a goal like unlocking the invention skill which requires level 80 in 3 skills is something that may take a whilebut it isnt just for nothing It unlocks powerful perks that will assist greatly in bossing or skilling Even getting level 99 in a stat on its own is satisfying and you are able to buy an accomplishment cape that has a special perk such as reviving you once every hour should you die which are similar to WoW tokens where you can redeem them in order to get 4 days of membership per bond These can be bought off the Grand Exchange for roughly 30 million gold pieces GP at the time of this review Not only thatbut members translates from OSRSRS3 as wellas long as you have members on the same account when switching between both gamesknown asThe Evolution of Combat EoC To summarizeEoC was basically a combat update where the games combat changed from clicking once and your character would fightto eventually having ability barsrevamped the entire combat triangleetc One might thinkWhy would it be bad Doesnt that make the combat more innovating Well sort of You seethe problem with EoC was that upon releaseit was horribly unbalanced Some abilitys totally overshadowed othersand it had ALOT of bugs It also made many weapons that were once very useful irrelevantlike dragon daggers and dragon claws Not to say it was a complete failure though Later on it became better as more bugs related to it was fixedbut it was too late by then because most of the playerbase had stopped playing the game PersonallyI feel indifferent towards this but it is difficult as to whether or not I should truly label this as a positivenegative about RS3 so I will leave it herejust to be able to do some sort of efficient bossinglet alone skill decently takes a significant amount of time to get going Im almost 300 hours in at the time of this review and I still am working towards things like combo overloads I would not have some of the progress I had today if I did not swap gold from OSRS to RS3which shows how significant the grind is Some may like itsome wont Its all personal opinionbut in the end I can say for sure that RS3s grinds in general are definitely quicker than OSRSthere are a fkton of MTXs in this game compared to it Theres literally a minigame in RS3 known asTreasure Hunter where you can open chests and have a chance of getting exp or 200 million cash This is why it is much easier and faster to max in RS3 compared to OSRS Combined with DXP eventsbeing able to literally buy EXP for basically every skill in the game is something that puts off many playersmyself included Some people may sayoh just ignore it orit doesnt affect you or evenjust login every day You get 2 free or do quests You get 2 every quest completionso it balances out Yeah no It doesnt matter if they give it to me for free or even if I ignored itI still get reminded every day that I have treasure hunter keys available to be useda tick is the way both Runescape 3 and OSRS process your own characters actions It is fking horrific Being at 06 seconds every tick Think of it as playing at 600 pingplus the latency from whatever country you are connecting from to that server All server sided actions are determined by this tick systemwhich is extremely annoying when doing things like bossing You want to move to a specific location No problemjust click on a tile and wait 06s for your clicks to register As frustrating as this isJagex has acknowledged this and are planning to turn the tick rate to 0s instead of 06s which Well that was like last year or the year before that so thats probably gonna be a whileI shouldnt have to spend an hour or two in game just to readjust the UI so it is to my liking Of coursesome may say to switch to legacy mode or the legacy UI which changes your entire HUD so it is similar to that of RS2but you will not be as strong as if you were to use EoC insteadacross both OSRS and RS3 Even with 2FAyou can still have your account taken from you just from basic social engineering Recentlya popular streamer known as Woox some may say the best OSRS player had one of his OSRS accounts taken from someone just because somebody asked Jagex for his account information Absolutely horrible and this needs to be addressedI prefer OSRS over RS3 because of nostalgia and I enjoy the PvM content there more Despite being more simpleit still manages to find innovating ways to encounter the bosses with the simpler combat system Even though I believe OSRS  RS3that doesnt mean RS3 is necessarily a bad game Both are good in my eyesand which one you like better is up for you to decideHello Fifteen year veteran herewith over 7000 total logged hours on a few accountsI can personally say I recommend this game to anyone who fancies themselves an MMORPG playerRS3 has undergone a few model changeswith the addition of microtransactions I find that they are a necessary part of keeping the game aliveso long as they are implemented in the proper way NOT Pay to win Microtransactions in particular have been a cause of hugely heated debate amongst the Runescape community PersonallyI find them easy to avoid Your opinions willof coursebe your ownhours and hours may be spent grinding a skill you wish to maxor getting your best kill time on a popular boss With 28 skill to try and maxand hundreds of monsters to kill for lootand millions and billions of Gold Pieces to be madeRS3 has many many hours still yet to offer even a player like me However you wish to spend your timeRS3 is a great place to spend itI started playing at 4 years of age I met my best friend on here in 2006 and we are sitting in Discord together as I type this out My best friend introduced me to my wifewith whom I have two wonderful children with This is not a dating sitefeel free to add me for any questions you may have My name is Flynnsterand I hope to see you in gameIm averaging roughly 8 hours of active playtime a day on top of a normal 8 hour job Kinda disgusting to be honestis more or less a single player experiencealthough there are some minigames that you can play that involve a lot of player interaction The game truly kicks off late gamealthough getting to that point is a journey in itself But it is most definitely not a boring journey Being able to set your own goals and accomplish them at your own pace is what sets Runescape apart from other MMOs It is hard to touch on the core mechanics of the game since every mechanic is considered a core mechanic Just gonna use that as a segway to get people to play RunescapeI have about 0000 hours in RuneScape and if you likebefore you know ityou’ll have been playing for almost 5 years and have about 0000 hours in the gameplaying RuneScape is like clapping Once you start you never really stop The intervals between playing claps might increase but you never truly stopJagexthanks for an alright first 0000 hours and here’s to the next 0000 CheersA place where I spent almost 0k hours andremaxedreremaxedMy brother has played for probably about  yearspaid for membershipincluding his wifes and put so much time in the game He wanted to get my boyfriend and myself into the game and offered us a big sum of in game money to get us started He had the moneyobviously from playing the game for years This resulted in him being banned PERMANENTLY He tried to appealbut they claimed their mod found evidence of cheating which is just insane He was not able to talk to an actual person and when trying to contact them on facebook a bot sent him a picture of a cake while funny situations like this need to be taken more seriously He loved this game and was a dedicated player for years and it was all taken away for NOTHING
1,I am 75 and retired and yesa gamer  I had been playing a lot of Valheim and what I loved most about that game was the building component My son bought me Space Engineers for my birthdayand now I have two incredible building and resource mining games Space Engineers is working this old brain helping me avoid mind deterioration I love this game and I appreciate the community that shares some incredible accomplishmentsI just had an epiphany Yes I didtheir money and wishes are just as important righteasy mode doesnt teach you anything Its a Lego meet Asteroids style and some even called it for a Minecraft clone as a result Add building block Add another blockand another ad infinitum until you have spaceship For meit got boring quickly Its called creative mode just buildit took me over an hour to work out how to build a single block from the remains of a craft crashed into an asteroidI have a ship I can salvageall the while careful of my energy limitmy inventory I need a refinery The refinery is needed if salvage doesnt give me everything I need so Ill need raw material to convert to ingotsincluding uranium ore which I convert to processed uranium to fuel the reactor so I can do ALL these thingssteel etc Some of these can be salvaged Some have to be made Every component needs to locatedtransportedlinked and welded EVERY component You need a plan A rough sketch on what you intend to build helps alot It gives you purpose because time is of the essence if youre not watching and run out of fuel youre dead No energy means no refining of uranium ore to refuelexpending more of that precious reactor fuel Who knows The decisions you make determine what you build and how fast its going to takesky markershorizon indicatorscompasses or suchlose your bearings and home disappearslose it all or go friends only and do the hard yards with mates to build the biggest dang skyship ever made Theres missilesgunsturretsfire and light Death Theres explosionsbroken platformsbusted shipsCAD and a master plana lot of the options are not as intuitive as Id like The UI is a bit invasive and some work could be done here The universe is grey Im sure some awesome nebulae would fit in great here and add appeal to the wonder of spaceits alpha as I writebut Ive experienced no crashes Its going to be good thing this Space Engineers and the devs seem happy to includewhatever people damn well pleaseIll minerefinetransport and assemble another Itll be bigger Itll do more The welding torch will blind my eyes as I drift in and out of the superstructure boundariesmy suit energy draining awaySoafter nearly 5 years and 35k hours on this gameI finally decided to take some time to give this game the review it deserved Implicitlythe evidence is there for some types of people looking at youLego fanatics and Minecraft nutsbut if you have an attention span that has allowed you to get this farBUY THIS GAMEevery time Fair warningthe learning curve can be quite daunting as many hours as I have loggedIm STILL learning stuff and the build timedepending on settingsmay take hours to months to build Howeverwhen you hear that woosh sound from your Gyros kicking inand the hum of those engines when your ship leaves the station for the first timeits all worth it Everytime There will be your fair share of WTF moments but they are character building experiences at this point relatively for me because this game runs amazingly well now compared to earlier versions of the product Alsothe SE groups I have come to know makes me think that SE is one of the least toxic environments I have ever played in for any length of time 111 recommendand watch for KlangKeenMarekand our amazing modding community Thank you for all of your hard work This is the game I have waited my entire life to play YOU ROCKOkId best describe SE as Minecraft in space with a touch of Garrys mod for physics fun  I enjoy that sort of gameso it went on my watch list until the price point matched what I was willing to pay  I bought SE a few years ago when it was much younger and had some issues that made playing frustrating  There are still a few issues that need to be worked out more on that laterbut I think the dev team has done a great job of keeping it moving forwardjust you and vast space and exploration  Some have said that this lack of story and the lack of any real end game type content takes away from the game and I can see where they are coming from  If youre the type of person who gets bored just building things and you want to get to a point where things just work so you can go after bad guysthen this is probably not your type of game  If you are the type of person who finds yourself annoyed at the story and such getting in the way of tinkering and seeing what you can do with what you havethen this is probably right up your alley  I cannot stress enough that this game is very much multiplayer friendly  If you canplay with others  Its way more fun to work together on things  It makes the accomplishments that much more awesome when you can show them off and have a laugh with friends when they fail miserably and possibly explosivelyId recommend watching a few beginners guide videos for this game  A youtuber called Vechs has a really good set of videos that should do a good job of setting your expectations for your first play   Heres the first one urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvy825m51cCfASpace Engineers Meteor Storm Survival Episode 1url  I would recommend starting in space as well  Ill explain why laterbut suffice it to say its just easier to get the hang of things and in my humble opinion more fun  Once againI would also recommend playing with friends if you can  The basic premise is very much like minecraft Search for resources then build cool stuff  In the beginningyoull be building strikeuglystrike simple ships that will look much like the lego creations we all probably created as kids with the giant box of every lego piece in the house mishmash of mismatched parts  Forgot a forward thruster Just stick one on somewhere  Need to go faster  Slap some more thrusters on that baby  And of that leads to the next sectionyour iterative design process that yielded the Mineosaurus with 8 mining heads and just the right size to get inside asteroid caves was a long one  When you crash itit sucks  But this is what I love about it  More so than any other game Ive playedI find myself playing rather conservatively sometimes with my favorite toys and I take care of them because Im proud of how well they work and having to rebuild is kinda sad  I like this attachment and I think it alters the gameplay in a way that almost fills the void where a story might go  Now that being said there are ways to create blueprints and rebuild the ships you made more quicklybut I wont go into that here because it isnt always the best option and it is sometimes more trouble than its worthbut if I had started playing on a planetthis would probably be a very different review  Gravity sucks and they havent gotten the physics balance where it ought to be for good gameplay in my opinion  Friction is a thing thatin space is not really a key factor  On a planetits everything because any rolling vehicle needs it and it just doesnt work well  Collisions cause damageduhright  But what if every little bump and bounce your little dune buggy hits causes damage  It does  We gave up on rolling vehicles after having more than one explode for seemingly no reason  As of this writingwheeled vehicles are just useless except on perfectly flat terrain and thats not really much fun  Gravity makes building flying devicesarguably the greatest portion of gameplay in SEmore difficult and keeping them in one piece almost impossible  Landing without crashingeven with a good designis very difficult Its weird space is far more forgiving in this aspect  You can leave a ship parked in one place with just some thrusters and a gyro and it will stay therebut in gravityyou are constantly using fuel to keep your ship in the air and even more to keep it upright and level  These two facts make mining on planet an arduous task compared to in space  We killed more good equipment trying to make something that could mine ore without blowing up than I care to count  All that being saidonce youve got the hang of the gamegive it a try its a huge challengebut it isnt without rewards when you do get things working well enough to start to explore the planet a little more  We even had fun starting on planet and basically working to get ourselves to space before we could start exploring the stars on one play throughI was looking for a game that would give me some of the feels I got from playing Factorio I picked Space Engineers upand spent a hundred hours on it in a couple of weeks Its a deeply engaging experienceand to start with the planetary lander You start in a shipflying in the atmosphere of a planetwhich you cant leave because the ship only has atmospheric thrusterswhich only work when an atmosphere existsbut you can fly around until you find the perfect landing spot Once you get therestart scraping your ship to collect material to establish your first base From therethe worlds your oister Expand the basemake mining vehiclesexplore the planetset up outposts And when you feel readymake a rocketand take off for the stars If youre luckyyour rocket will be powerful enough for you to leave the planets gravity welland youll be ready to make your first space station Then of courseyou will need a new space mining shipa shuttle to get back and forth from planets and moonsa mothership to store your stuff and your shipssomething to defend against pirates And I havent talked about the multiplayer yetI couldnt recommend it more As you can see from my time playedit is incredibly addictive The gameplay is amazingthe ship building is an absolutely blastand then using your ships is even more of a blast In more ways than one The community is one of the best on steamand I think this game deserves that title too I built a big space ship with everything you would need Then when I was ready to use it for destruction I realized I have no friendsalmost a thousand hours in and i still dont really know what im doingIt took us hours to buildand hours more to paintbut when it was doneour station was top notch three designated landing padsa central control hub to maintain the stations sytsemsa player hub filled with medical bays and storage spaceand two full refineryassembler combos My partner in crime placed the blocks I welded them in place and splashed some paint on it all once the basic shape of it was finished It was not largebut it was cleanfunctionaland designed with sophistication  It was oursand we had built it out from the tiny little square of space we had started withturned it into our own little command post lodged in the side of an otherwise unnoteworthy asteroidthough Without the shipsthere were no resources to build with First was the mining ship We equipped it with four sets of drills and my partner took it out on missions to gather more resources He was goneand so I built our second ship a fast little cruiser made only to get from one place to the next or to scout out potential mining sites We called it the Toad And so we settled into a routine I would take the Toad out and find a nice planet ready for excavation and he would go plow into it with the mining ship We unloaded the materials We assembled them into parts We put those parts into the blocks he had put down We toiled We slaved We built and built and builtLook what we have built from nothing Admire our structure Did we bask in the glory of a hard fifteen hours of workthe beginning of our empire the Mothershipthree storage containerstwelve gigantic thrustersenough room in the hangars to store both of our ships and possibly moreseveral medical bays to respawn in—and one ridiculously enormous ship We placed the first block above our station And then another and anotheruntil the massive frame of it started to block out the light It was a monolith to our own accomplishmentsa totem of sheer ingenious design and willpower Not a block was out of placenot a single reactor was missingbut the blocks couldnt be finished without more steel plates We need iron—a lot of iron So away my partner went He climbed into the mining shipsteered it towards our latest excavation site and gunned the engines He hit max speed He piloted the ship around the end of the ghostlike frame of the Mothership And then it happened—the unthinkable he ran out of fuelwith no way to stop the mining ship from moving forwardhad to bail out of the ship before it carried him away to oblivion There was a panicked rush to mount a rescue of our mining ship by using the Toad to chase after it so we could supply the mining ship with the fuel its reactor needed to activate the reverse thrusters and stop the shipwith the slowheartpounding realization of a horror filma shadow passed over the Toad  We looked up at the Mothershipour entire view eclipsed by its awesome mass We dropped our tools and stared in guttwisting horror1 hoursI enjoyed them tooSpace Engineers wasand sadly still is nothing more than Marek Rosas Kick Starter for a completely different company called Good AI KSH lost most of its senior staff and programmers for this new companyand SE has gone completely downhill sincePlanets being the last Gift the original team left usnewmore nefarious bugs created by the inexperienced staff leftover from the original KSH or maybe just cheap hired help and planets that have been expanded on exactly zero timesthose exist too5 or more There is fun to be hadjust dont expect any ground breaking progress The only thing keeping this game alive is moddersprops to themI usually dislike early access games I usually take a fat pinch of salt when I see new build your own style game comes come onto Steam too Not in this case Space Engineers has quickly earned a spot in my all time favorite PC games for its dynamic and engaging construction system and its got one of the coolest looking destruction systems Ive ever seen in a game like this The devs have been keeping up with weekly updates since its launch and theyre very involved with the community As a matter of factplayer made content will be appearing as randomly spawned ships in the upcoming exploration patcheven familiar for most people Im sure Its like Minecraftin that youre building pretty much everything out of blocksbut thats where the similarities end Ships are made by sticking a power plantcockpita couple gyroscopes and thrusters In every direction by the way Space has no gravity or atmosphere so your ship needs forward thrusters to slow downetcmaybe a few weapon systems Then you have to hook up conveyor pipes to most of those things to power them with resources and components you get from mining asteroids Ships can be as big or as small as you likethe only real limit is how much your PC can handle Everything from little scout fightersmining shipsfrigatesfighter carriers and even humongous titansized battleships can be built Yesyou could even build your own Death Starbut you might have to wait a little while for a working Superlaser Or you could just mod your own Superlaser into the gamebecause Space Engineers has a modding API and a fully fledged Steam Workshop page thats already crammed with all sorts of player created contentor if the first ship you had gets destroyed and you want a replacementyou can just ctrlv it into the game after selecting it from the blueprints menu Very very handytear and otherwise deform when they take damagewhether youre hosing them down with leadsetting off explosions or just smashing into eachother for fun You can see the damage your ship takes over time as holesscratchesdents and warping are modelled into most blocks Even portions of your ship can be sheared off and cause extra damage as they free float in spacegetting knocked around and causing even more havoc as they get caught on your ship and tear it apart from the inside if youre not careful The same rules apply to your enemy too though Its very exciting and sometimes anxietyinducingthe way combat workssurvival and creative Survival mode lets you build everything from scratch and assemble it together using the various ingame tools youre provided with Everything needs to be constructed piece by piece and youre limited by how many resources you have and what kind of tools you have available You can mount bigger and better drillswelders and grinders onto your ships after you acquire enough suppliesas does the overall performance of the gamebut so far its come together very very nicely and I expect Ill put another fifty hours or so into the game before its releasedBattlestar GalacticaWarhammer 4k or any other scifi genrebuy this game Youll thank me laterIf this game were only creative modeit would still be one of the greatest games ever made  I used to describe the game as Minecraft in Spacebut I think that analogy falls very short of the truth  Ive seen people build things in this game that just boggle the mind  One person used a simple set of rotors to make a tank tread that was far more amazing than if the programmers had just put a stock tank tread component into the game  Another person used a series of timers to build an autonomous mining drone that could be set loose to gather materials while the player performed other tasks  The key word in the title of this game isnt Spaceits EngineersMe and my brother used to build space ships out of the pieces in Halo Reach forge world Fun times Always wished we could build those and fly them I used to build space ships in the early days of minecraft Same thoughtif only I could build ships and fly them around Then I this game comes out all those years laterand too see the amount of work that has been done on it since is amazingthere are tons of those who complain about certain things with some updatesand sometimes people dont like the direction the comapny might be takingbut all in allI still have a great time playing thisand with the planets it ads a whole new level of fun to what once was an asteroid hopping gameweaponsskinsyou name itsomeone has made it Mods are what really make this game for meFrom the very first videos that promoted this game prior to its launch on Steamthe game looked impressivemelding a voxel game similar in nature to another popular game to a deformable physics platform set in SpaceSpace Engineers has been in Early Accessbut each week the developers have been adding to and improving the gameadding features requested by the communityas well as adding their own particular enhancementsmaking Space Engineers an impressive multiplayer sandbox experienceand hope to continue playing for a long time to comeSpace engineers What can I say Its the best space sandbox out there During my time playing itive started a factionheld destruction derbiescrashed massive ships into one anotherand build beautiful stations inside asteroids Ive spent over an hour searching for cobalt to make a single ore detectorconstructed a walking robot only to see it destroyed by a stray asteroidand built a ridiculously fast ship to stab other ridiculously fast ships with I made something orbit before Spherical Gravity Generators were added I cant describe the amount of fun Ive had with this game The devs are awesometheres an incredible new update every weekand the community is amazing Sodo I recommend it Hell yesits actually rather funnyMy friend collected materials for our very first ship for hours and i crashed it on takeoffHe sounded like he was having a stroke or something and then there was silence on teamspeak 11A friend told me to get this Few minutes after i started playing for the first time i used jetpack to try and reach them but it ran out of hydrogen and i went face first into ground and died Friend wanted me to get on his buggy so i went to crouch forward towards it but pressed jetpack button and went face first into it and died We got into space and i spent 3 days building my perfect ship but then i got caught in planets gravity and crashed face first into planets surface Absolutely love this game xDAs you can see by the hours Ive logged in Space EngineersI like this gameI thought Id put a brief review of it upit doesnt have a lot of stuff happening for the player to respond to There are a couple token NPC typesand some largely directionless NPC shipsbut the game world overall feels rather lifeless Thankfully there are a number of mods that address thisbut the unmodded singleplayer world doesnt force the player to respond to it very muchapart from various resource and survivalrelated concerns Expect singleplayer to be more of a contemplative experience that you take at your own paceand in which you set your own goals While I would definitely prefer there to be more active challenges that Im forced to respond tothe gameplay that is there is still a lot of fun No other game Ive played has made designing and building my own base as enjoyable as Space Engineersthe degree depending on the server youre on I have played very little multiplayer myselfbut friends Ive talked to have described a range of server typesfrom hardcore PvP to private little servers focused around building things together MP is much more stable than it used to bebut you should still be prepared for potentially frustrating bugsparticularly physicsrelated ones That saidif I had time in reallifeId be active on a multiplayer server without hesitationbecause the fun you can have outweighs the frustrationdamagedor destroyed by colliding with another object No other game Ive played provides this aspectand it shapes just about every aspect of gameplay directly or indirectly As the name indicatesthe main challenge of Space Engineers is that of engineering solutions to problemsand the physics system is essential to giving the player problems that need to be solvedbecause you can weaponize the physics system  something that has led to a very entertaining and active arms race between various players trying to build better playermade weapons and defenses to them The programmable blockwhich allows players to run scripts theyve written in Callows this to be taken to its logical extremerunning guidance programs written by the players themselvesyou know it has succeeded Im not sure at iwhati but its definitely some kind of success by and large the games physics make sense I do wish Keen would simplify some aspects of the physics system furtherto make gameplay easier even at the cost of realismbut the physics system these days is much more of an asset than a liability And if Im entirely honest with myselfIve never seen a game that uses physics that behaves perfectly realistically Fans of Kerbal Space Program will understandand Id like to properly do the game justice by writing an indepth one laterbut this will have to do for now If you like voxelbuilding gamesscifi stuffand selfdirected gameplayyou will probably like Space EngineersSpace Engineers is an excellent game and a gift that keeps on giving That being said it is a game I wager is best enjoyed by certain audiencesand is an ideal game to spend a lot of time playing for anyone who enjoys building If youre like me and gladly sink hours into building a complex spaceship to fly it into spaceplace satellites in orbitmake a mars roving vehicle or recreate the ISS you will love this game That being said I STRONGLY recommend looking into mods especially the ones I link under cons as they compliment some of the more primitive or shoddy systems in the game Especially the mod that adds real atmosphericflight physics is a must havesince it makes building functional aircraft a real experience The speed is normally locked to 1 ms but this can be changed easily with mods without any real side effects Makes travelling around huge systems or even planets a little bit less tedious

1,Went exploring a cave fully equipped Made it out barely alive and lost most of my equipmentInstead of looking for my son I built a few gazebosa rudimentary navy with an armada of small raftsand fullystocked dock homes strategically placed along the river system and coastlines I watched the sunset while drinking a soda and realized I never wanted a son anyway 11I generally hate survival games  You know the ones i meanthe ones that became almost overnight megahits a few years back like ArkRust etc  Anyone whos tried to actually play one knows spawn campers and the shoot on sight mentality makes it rough without a very large grouptruly like this game as even without the PvP I thought itd be the same tired old grind  Chop down some treesmake a houseblah blah blah  Jesus I was wrong  First thing i noticed is the enemies are actually pretty terrifying  Id be chopping down a tree or hunting a deer and hear screeching from something that didnt even sound human anymore coming from way too close for comfort only for a mutant cannibal thing to leap out a tree at me and almost give me a heart attacksometimes theyll screech at you without attacking  Even when you expect them to attacktheyre stealthy as hell and almost always surprise mebut never easy to come by  Combining that rock solid gameplay loop with terrifying enemies causes The Forest to transcend every other survival game Ive ever tried  Its funterrifyingand mysterious in the best way possible  Cannot reccomend this game highly enough Attacked by naked peopleA game that actually escapes early access and still keeps a low price 1 devsDo you like Survival games where you craft things How about horror games that can still take you by surprise every now and then even after playing for hours Well then this game is for you  The game takes mechanics from both of these genres to give you an unsettlingyet fun experience in one game Build a base and defend it from mutant cannibals that roam the islandexplore caves to find items to make your life easierand solve the mysterys of the peninsulathis game has an actual storyline for your to complete The main characterEric LeBlancs plane crashes on the island and his son Timmy is kidnapped by a mysterious man covered in red paint Youll need to explore caves to find key items to help you in your search for Timmy and get to the bottom of the sinkhole in the center of the islandthis might be a good optionthere are starved skinny variants of each mutant type These mutants are crazed and attack out of desperation Theyll also stop to eat dead bodies occasionallyeven in the heat of battle These mutants are faster than their more sane counterparts but have less healthoften in patrols  These patrols are very dangerous without the proper weaponsinstead they just charge at you Their attacks have enough force to strip the player of armorkill other mutantslevel the players base in secondsand even knock down trees Trulytheyre not something to take lightlymy diet consists solely of snack bars and alcohol and i havent slept in 22 daysI highly recommend this game to anyone who can tolerate nudity and gore This can be just a survival game as you can turn the cannibals off on the main menubut to me the cannibals are the meat and potatoes of this game and I find myself sorely missing them should they not come visit me a couple of times a daybut will mostly unite in their hatred of the guy deforesting their landyou The cannibals will still throw a couple of punches at each other if there’s enough of them around however There are starving cannibals who will try to stalk you to find out where you live and try to scavenge off any kills you makescouts for larger tribes who will often simply run away to alert others of your locationshunting parties though I’m pretty sure they’re only hunting youand cannibals just trying to live out their lives in peace that you can finding sleeping in camps or caves Cannibals will duck and roll to evade attacksclimb trees to escapelight tennis balls on fire and throw them at youwreck your base if you’re not carefulbut they’ll also do things like drop effigies which you can catch them praying at if left uninterruptedthey’ll drag their wounded out of battle if they canand will run off to retrieve others if you let them escapebut will surface more frequently the more you piss the cannibals off These with the exception of the babies are significantly tougher to kill and do a lot more damage If they come near your base they mean business and while the spider mutant takes a couple of hits to tear anything downI’ve seen armsy rip a tree OUT OF THE GROUND and slam it into my basedestroying multiple defensive spikes and walls allowing the small army of ten or so he brought with him entrance into the base The sumo dude doesn’t even need to do anything super special to wreak havocif he runs at your base everything in his path will be destroyed until he stops runningthough I don’t think they’d ever be friendly with you If you escape the plane crash quickly before they find you and are not stalkedyou can have the opportunity to build a base without their knowledge if you pick a private enough location not on one of their common routesand they generally won’t find it unless you are followed home If in contrast you do everything you can to piss them off mass cannibal killingsmutant killingseffigy destruction and creationburning their bodies in front of themthey will be significantly more inclined to bother you constantly In my current single player game I see at least 46 spider mutants a day somewhat near my base12 armsiesand the sumo dudes have only just started coming out so luckily it’s been one at a time Even though I am absolutely plagued by mutantsI can always ghost them and move to a different part of the map You’re in control of how much you see themwhich really makes the game AI feel more real and dynamicwhich really doesn’t happen in multiplayer Sure when you’re in the caves they’ll still drop from the ceiling but when it’s two against three your odds are a lot better and you know itdiluting the terroryou can eat peopleThe Forest is all about surviving and getting out alive butnow that I finally did itI cant wait to get back to it in the upcoming sequelme and my friends led mostly nomadic livesbuilding only what was necessary to spend the night while catering only to the most basic needs and staying constantly on the move throughout the peninsula and its network of underground caves in pursuit of our goalsthat does not have to apply to you and your band of brothersI enjoyed the exploration the most and cant even remember all of the times that The Forest left me gasping in amazement Successfully navigating through and surviving the perils of the cave systems felt like a rewards of its own to which the frequent “lore chunks” and occasional gear upgrades were more of a cherry on topevery cave that we successfully navigated and went through felt like it was 1 our doing as there were no “arrows” guiding our way to take the creditand the moderate consumption and distribution of previously prepared rations encouraged us to embark on another expedition and conquer the peninsula and all of its nooks and crannysone by onetheres also a simple yet sufficient base building aspect to The Forestgetting familiar withharvesting and eventually cultivating local flora and even some fauna comes with advantages of their own – as well as the consequencesits great to have a place called home but should you stay in it for too long and make a ruckus while doing itbe prepared to deal with your new and openly unhappy neighborsbe prepared for more than a couple of sleepless nights Also keep in mind that violence breeds violence soif its not necessary or in selfdefensetry not to cast the first stone Cowering in the nearby bushes or simply running away is probably the best option  unless you crave bloodshedunlike most games dabbling in the survival genreThe Forest actually has the beginning and the ending It even provides the player with optional activity that will encourage exploration and investigation which I highly recommend doing as it will shed some light on the history of the the land and events that took place therewellthats up for you to decide but I can say that I really liked it and that it definitely wasnt a bad one Those of you who liked spoiler“LOST”the TV showyou will most likely appreciate this one Bullsht ending not includedspoilercreative team and help them make a sequel worthy of The Forest I personally cant recommend it enoughI cut down a tree and it broke my houseso i cried for an hourTLDRuse skins for craftingand mount heads on wall of your houseEAI feel Ive gotten more than my moneys worth out of the game I havent finished the game yetbut Ive seen videos of people who have Im more interested in base building and waging war on cannibals There isnt much of a story Your plane crasheskid is abducted by cannibalsyou need to save him Thats all there is to it No quests or anything like that As you explore you find pictures drawn by kidsand photosand empty camps that show others have been here before you You need to put forth a good effort to piece together a story Almost like a detective Find the clues to explain the situation Its there if you want itbut seems to be something the devs threw in there as an afterthought Its well done imo thoughand takes some effort to make a really intricate base The system of base building allows you to build very complex bases though Which is great for when you get a large group of cannibals attacking your base you can make all kinds of fun ways to trap or funnel them into choke points for maximum cannibal crushing carnage After every update all the trees youve cut down will respawn So getting a bunch of trees suddenly appearing right through the middle of your house is a possibility Make sure you build your base around the trees youve cut downjust leave the stumps and build around them Cutting the trees that are growing through structures will destroy the structuremolotovsaxesspearsetc Just open the inventory and start combining ingredients Certain herbs can be combined to restore healthstam Combine 2 deer skin with rope and cloth to make a waterskin Feathers and sticks to make arrows Add cloth and booze to arrows to make fire arrows A watchcoinsboozecircuit board to make a bomb Add sap for a sticky bomb Pretty simple Once you add an item to the crafting mat in the inventory just right click something to add it to the crafting matno clicking and dragging nonsensea stick for examplea list appears telling you every item you can make using a stick A bowspearupgraded spearsnowshoesarrowsclubetc It doesnt tell you which ingredientsor how many you will need to make each item though So trial and erroror googleis needed Its kinda fun Almost like a mini gamehand holdingtutorial besides a very simplistic manual that explains the very basicsor anything like that As soon as you wake up in the crashed plane you have the freedom to do whatever it is you want No time constraints or anything like that This is what i love about the game Nothing is worse than having a 3 minute opening tutorial to explain that you have to eatsleepdrink in order to survive Alsono stupid plot points that open up more content Like doing a certain part of the story in order to craft fire arrows or whateverlike craftablefindable itemscome every 15 days I think it is Something like that There are a few items that have no use Snowshoes for example I would imagine that you will need them in the snow areasbut in the games current state they arent needed at all I see this as a good thing It means theres alot more tweaking and game mechanics to be implementedI will leave this out of the review Plenty of other reviews cover this subject Im sureit all comes down to if its worth the money or not In its current stateI have gotten my moneys worth of enjoyment out of the game many times over With more content and updates being added on a regular schedule It will only get more enjoyableI hope that the developers of this game will see this review Please dont give up on this game Please please continue to work on it and add on to it This has to be my absolute favorite game to play with friends and with my Fiance It keeps us interestedit definitely keeps us laughingbut I cant help to wonder and wish that it will become so much more than what it is This game has SO much potentialand already it is doing extraordinarily good I feel like we havent even come close to exploring all that there isbut I can only hope that this easily becomes a game like Skyrim was for me A game where I can spend hours and days on end just playing and enjoying this game Great workguys Keep it upThe Forest is hands down the best Alpha game I have ever purchased With that being saidid like to list the pros and cons of the gameI thought it would just be another one of those build a castle and live forever kind of games I was wrongthankfully In The Forestyou can build incredible structuresbut the enemies make your life difficult regardless of how good your defenses are Want to eat but your food reserves are low Too bad Theres a raiding party of 6 cannibals outside yelling at you about your destruction of the environment The more you cut down trees and kil cannibalsthe more enemies will come for you Its like the EPAbut theyre pissed off and want to eat you The cannibals will hound you day and nightand theyre crafty little things They will gang up on you from all sides Just when you thnk theyve left and its safe to kill that lizard thats been running from you for a weekthey come out of nowhere and start beating you downand thats it But nopethe developers of The Forest actually made a compelling and interesting story and it makes sense Theres bits of lore to find everywhere From cavesto boatsand sometimes just on the ground in select places The game offers lots of foreshadowing and clues to what is really going on there The games ending is just great as well It answers damn near all the questions that I had asked about the gamebut you know what the awesome part is The ending is not an easy thing to get to Why is that Well Ill address it in my next pointand it doesnt matter how much Ive explored them I STILL get spooked when I go into a cave I know Ive cleared in search of some cans of coke and some TNT Theres an eerie feeling about the cavesbecause theyre not just caves theyre breeding grounds and bases for the cannibals Theres noises that you think are cannibles breatingwhen in reality its just sounds from the cave itself Creakingrocks fallingthe occasional maniacle laughter Oh wait that one is the cannibalswho are likely pissed that youre invading their home These caves are also pitch blackdid I mention that you need to bring a torchor 12 I meanyou really shouldnt go exploring in caves in anything less than full bone armor and the Katana or Modern Axe Nah just kidding You can explore them with only a lighter and your prayersand youll probably get eaten just the same You know what really sucks though All the best gear and gear you need to beat the game is located in the various cave systemsbuggy mess its mostly not The game is still terrifying and immersivebut now youre able to play it with friends The scaries part of coop isnt the cannibals though Its guarding your food from your friend with the appetite of an elephant and the hunting skills of a quadriplegicsome cannibals might show up to fight you This isnt a problem when you have traps though You know what is a problem The cannibals seem to have the deductive reasoning abilities of a brain dead alpaca when faced with traps GRR GRR and BLEAT BLEAT will run head first into a trap while RAWR RAWR stays behind and watches his two friends get impaled He then decides that its an amazing idea to do THE SAME THING that they just did Its not as bad now as it used to be in prior patchesbut they still do stupid stuff like thisthe game decides that youd like to take a 5 story fall into a cave with a Virginia and her babies It doesnt happen oftenand has only affected me in Coop games thus farbut its still a massive pain in the ass or legsas it werein my opinionis an absolute steal at 15 This game gets a 91 from me I took off a point because of the annoying bugs and glitches that occasionally happen It is almost perfectbut missed the margin of perfection by just a hair If you dont yet own the gameI would encourage you to get it Its great by yourself and even better with friendsFor my first 15 hours in the game And not watching any tutorials walktroughs that spoil the story Ive learnt a few thingsThis game has oodles of potential Nothing more romantic than strolling down a sunset beach being chased by a bunch of naked cannibals Makes you feel like a celebrityif you are patient You dont mind set backsand have a good sense of humour Get it now Its pretty awesome even with all the flaws Regular updates mean youre generally not stuck too long with one issue of course with each update youll generally stumble upon something else to perplex you think of it as hurdles But everything looks pretty so thats okayeaten by land sharksdislike leviatating geesebackwards rabbits and other such oddities then I suggest you wait it out till the game is more developedto a near naked oiled up manthing scooping up the unconsious childthis upsets me somewhat because now I have no one to offer as a peace sacrifice to the natives After he runs off into the bushes with the kid I yell SHOULD OF WORN YOUR SAFETY BELT YOU LITTLE SHIT I help myself to numerous trays of inflight meals and booze glorious booze that due to some miracle survived the plane crash and are still sitting neatly on seats and shelves I pick up random pill bottles and devour the contents and collect a pedometer from a foothow ironic Lucky for meI am a paranoid survival enthusiast and was wearing my outdoor back pack complete with survival guide in preparation for this very eventgrabbing a conviently placed fire axe fitted snuggly in that slack flight attendants chestI raid a few luggage cases of the non existant passengersmmm sexy panties Wandering the beach at sunsetalchohol lines the beachesnatures natural drink cooler and notice a group of nudists Fuck yes This island is awesome I run up to them waving my drink in greeting The god of Tits and wine has blessed this place They stare at me like I am some kind of freakprobably because Im wearing clothes and this has obviously offended thier religon because the nearest native attempts to claw my eyejellies outshocked I hi 5 him in the face with my axe and the natives fleeshiny butts bouncing in the sunlightbeing the survivalist I am I slaughter a few fluffy bunnies and a lizardskin them and find a nice spot to set up for the night I start a fire with my trusty everlasting lighter Thank goodness they kindly let me bring my lighter aboard the plane I build a small shelter out of sticks and cook myself a lizardyou can just taste the intestinal parasitesno point trying the planes radiosalvaging and rebuilding the yatch or boats I spotted on the beach or any of that shitwith one arm I push the sled along with the mere power of my pinky toe thankful for my Russian hertiage I build myself a snazzy tree house because daddy issues meant I never had one as a child I stash my porn in it along with the panties I salvaged from the wreck Ive got 4 wallsa drying racka firestorage facilaties for my suppliesa freaking gazebo and a bunch of death traps surrounding my walls for those pesky nativeswho despite the abundance of wildlife and edible plantshave opted for human flesh instead Gotta hand it to them thoughthey have some really inspiring art peicesthe man shoved through his own tennis rackets and every orifice crammed with tennis balls is my favouritebrings me to tears every time I see it If I was going to make any effort whatsoever to return to human civilizationId totally steal some of thier work and sell it for millions Ive been working on my own style using the cannibals body partsmy centrepeice being head on a stick I just cant seem to capture the same passions thoughthey are in awe of them as they repeatedly ram thier faces into itand growl at it Small minded barbarians hahahand caught fire to myself In the rain Adeles song has so much more meaning to me nowIm going to cover the least talked about subject of this gamewhich is the AI Its a mixed bagbut nothing really stands out as bad In factbesides a few pathfinding issues with large mutantsits actually really good It should be noted that I havent completed a playthrough yetbut only because Im a completionist and have not decided to climb down the hole yetthey seem to act somewhat realistically I play on hard modebutthey seem to have a genuine interest in their own personal wellbeing NowI dont know exactly what attacks look likesince I built my base super strategically by hanging a bridge from the side of a cliff to a house built in the oceanbut I can describe my normal encounters on day 5about that sense that they indeed care for their own wellbeing It seems possible to intimidate the cannibals simply by not backing downand holding your ground when they rush at youand rushing at them back You can do this dance of feint rushes to make them hesitant in attacking you If you just runthey will be encouraged to attack you If you strike out against them defensivelythey will also be encouraged to attack youif you pick your targets carefully such as only attacking the one that musters the courage to attack first of the groupor the strongest member of the groupthe rest will become fearful You can then take them down one by one until they flee You can then flee yourselfotherwise they will come back Or you can waitdepending if you need more bodies to burn if they bring a firethrower with themit changes the dynamic a little bitbecause then the cannibals are under the misconception that ranged attacks are safer to perform than melee attacks But if you chase them downwellthen they were wrongif youve beaten the heck out of everyone Bashed and bruisedeven a large group will stop attacking if you clearly had the upper handand they have no more ranged members You can just sit on a bench to recharge your staminaand everybody can just chill for a bit Then you finish itit is possible to have a terrifying presence in this game like Falloutbut you gain it by actual ingame ACTIONSnot stat points It is possible to make even a large mutant run away believe metheyre faster than they looklol Tried to run it downbut it just disappearedbefore anybody is under the false impression that the game is easyIve played in multiplayer My bro and I would wander off by ourselvesand be fine But three or four of his friends sticking together Theyre constantly dying Thats because they arent playing the mind game with the cannibals Its like they know whether youre afraid or not And whether or not youre going to make them eat that club of theirs Being smart is heavily rewarded in this gameand numbers arent going to be an easy route to victorymost notably when it comes to large mutants and caves I meanI suppose its difficult for them to pathfind down there sometimesand they arent going to climb Combined with what seems to be an intimidation systemyou can end up with situations where a large mutant will simply stand there and stare angrily On the other handthere are genuinely unexpectedly smart moments Once a feral cannibal followed me homeand I turned around to see where it was hiding now It popped its head up from behind a rock to peek at me in a humerous fashionreminding me of a ferret or a groundhog Shame they had to end up in the fire pitThis is seriously a real gem NowI dont usually like horror gamesfilmsanything scary because I get minor heart attacks if someone as much as speaks or claps suddenly That being saidmy husband bought this game and I watched him play it I was scared to deathbut the more I watched the more I just couldnt keep my fingers off of itbut keep in mind that it is an alpha gameand I still amnice weather and sound effects and moreand I am completely terrified of them They have very smoothelegant and agile movementsand they can be very sneaky Watch your back while chopping wood for your constructionsyou constantly feel tense and threatened by your sorroundingswhether its movement in the distancea shadowa rustling of leaves or other soundsand the crafting possibilities are ever improving with new content being added Custom building can be slightly buggybut Im sure they will fix it and add to itprobably not knowing that it already exists At the start screensimply type veganmode and you will not see any cannibals at all This allows you to just enjoy yourself in peace if you feel like surviving and building You may also type vegetarianmodeif you wish for the cannibals to only be out at nightgiving you a breathing space during the day This is very lovelybut as I also briefly saidit is very very buggy and laggy Hopefully they will fix itwhich I feel confident that they will Alsoyou should note that there are currently saving problems with coop The host can save the game while in multiplayerbut your coplayer wont be able to join the game again after quitting The host can continue the game in solo modebut not with friends This is a shame I very much hope they will fix this soon EDIT I just managed to rejoin a game that my husband had hosted earlierso maybe it is possible HoweverI started back in the airplane each time I rejoined Either wayIm sure all of this will be smoothed out eventuallyglitchyblah blah Its alphaits to be expected I dont think there are any game breaking bugs or glitchesthough If something is buggedI havent experienced not being able to fix it with a quick reload of the gamewhich would give the game some more sense of purpose For nowits justscavengebuildeatdrinkfight  survive But I enjoy that and I think some cannibal buildings also are in different places I dont necessarily dislike thiseven though a new world every time would make exploring all the more exciting HoweverI do hope that they make the map quite a bit bigger If they dont you end up knowing the entire island in and out quite quicklyand then there wont be much exploring left to do Making the island itself bigger would workbut making more islands to explore using your raft or whatever would be even more awesome I have high hopesbut well see what the devs have in store for us the game still seems to be far off beta I am not sure how long we will have to wait However long it isthoughI am completely sure that the end result will be breathtaking in every aspect Keep up the good workdevsyou are doing so wellbut this is all I can think of for now I may update my review as more additions are made to the game OverallThe Forest is a keeper 11 shining stars from me despite the bugs and what not I would highly recommend anyone who like survivalsandboxhorror games to buy this game  also during early access The devs are clearly putting the money to good useso I feel good about having offered them some support at this early stage In factI was very surprised at how cheap it is It almost feels like I robbed themBuy it Now DIFFICULTY Game goodsolo fun coop funny why waste time say lot word when few word do trick
1,h1 Wololo from 213 with love h1singleplayer with decent AIlive multiplayer community  and that all on modern engine offering uptodate resolutions New content 2 dlcs with new nations and campaigns is just a cherry on the delicious cake that AoE II HD ismodern resolutionsDLCs of new nations and campaignstrading cardsWorkshophe Does it make senseJust nominated this for the test of time awardand for a good reasona lot of balancing work went into it and new civs were added that fit into the game nicely and enrich the overall experience while still staying true to the coreit doesnt need you to have korean progamer levels of apm to enjoy itand it still istakes me back to when life was simple come home from school run up the old pc and play age of empires till i was told to go bed this game will always have a special place in my heart 111This was the game that got me interested in history Still as good as it was 2 years ago An absolute blast to play And guess what It must have done something right because now Im a history teacherEasily my favorite gameuse to play on the disc when I was a lot youngerstarted playing about 1 years ago Found steams HD version and Ive never been happier about finding a gameOh boywhere do I begin Ive been playing this game since it was released as a demo for maximum pc back in 1998 My father showed me it at a computer store that he used to work at in the small community that we used to live in I was only 4 years old at that timeand I remember the only civilizations you could be were the Brits and Celts I first laid eyes on the scout calvarywould ignore the shit out of everything elsebecause he looked cool in my eyes at 4 years of age Since thenIve been playing this game on and offIm 21 nowand I still find myself latched on to it I now have a daughter of my ownalthough she wont know what it was like to see the game evolve over the course of 16 yearsshe will still know how it came to beassuming she would even find it as cool as I have growing up I think for me at least it was the growing anticipation of seeing something new with every civwhile still keeping the basics of the game simple and the same in its own ways I used to play this during lunch break in middle school from 2629 with all of my friendsfor the most partI came out on topeven had our own little community of playersformed our own cluband we made a board game out of it It was pretty cool that not all of us were premature nerds that played thisat least half of our little community were jocks that just loved it as much as we didand there was no discrimination involved in any of it  We amassed to a total of 2 or more people in this communityand for a small amount of usour community is still strong with new members and old This game is called Age of Empires IIand it will stand the test of time for the ages Im happy and delighted that people are still playing this game 16 years laterand were still finding newcomers for this game at as faster rate than before Ive come to realize that just since early 214 I have ended up spending hundreds of hours playing this gameteaching people both young and old what to do in this game Im so thrilled to see that this game is coming out with new expansions still to this dayeven after 16 years I think that if I were to find the gold edition realeased back in 24 without the package being opened or tornI would keep it as a collectors itemthis game has so much potential and Im happy to see that its not being thrown away in to the trash I honestly believe that when I die of old ageassuming that I dont die any other wayI will more than likely have a copy in my coffin for when my body gets discovered generations laterpeople will know what kind of influence this game had on my life as much as anyone elses life I honestly didnt even play the Conquerors expansion pack until 27even though I knew about it unpon release datemy mother refused me video gamesso I never got to play it on time like most of my friends didbut I knew that I would at some point in time Due to my parents seperation back in 21 shortly after my mothers mother diedI ended up living with my motheras she got the majority of custody except on holidays when I would be with my father Whenever I was with himhe would let me play gameseven though it was against my mothers wishes I really loved playing as the CeltsBritonsFranksGothsand Vikingsat the timethey were my favorite Now and again howeveryou will find me riding along Genghis Khans horde as the Mongolshoweveryou can also find me still enjoying the company of the Goths and Britions I love all of the civilizations very muchI know that they all have their strengths and weaknessessome are greater than others My best advice to you is to rush your enemies into the dirt while still keeping up with your economy via micro manage I would rate this game a solid 11 and would also highly recommend it to anyone who still finds the old RTS game to be complexed and fun I cant wait for the new expansion to come out November 5th 215 African Kingdoms will have without a doubt in my mind as many new features as it pre successors I hope you all have a try at this gameits for sure my favorite game of all timeThis game has long been a childhood favorite It was the first game I ever bought and owned for the PC I played a lot of this gamemainly singleplayer back in 26but scratched the CD a couple years later When I found it had been remastered on Steam I was quick to purchase myself a copy and have been playing both singleplayer and multiplayer since For those of you who used to own a copy like myselfI highly advise purchasing this digital editionas it offers both the same nostalgic gameplay and a great strategic outlet The Forgotten DLC also gives you more to explore and adds even greater variety to an already extensive game I highly recommend this titleas it has quickly rebecome a personal favoriteit was one of the older RTS games dating back to the late 9s  early 21st century Im surprised more people dont play it You are given a wide selection of civilizations with specific perks eachand try to race each other towards an objectivebe it a Wonder RaceDeathmatchor King of the Hill All of which are great fun What really stands out with this game is that there are hundredsif not thousands of ways to win Grantedthe mechanics may seem simple and outdatedbut when trying to runn an entire empire with 2 units against up to seven other playersevery click counts as you try to outmaneuveroutthinkand outmicro your opponent The graphics may take a while to get used tobut what you really should look forward to enjoying is the satisfaction of wrecking the strong defenses of an enemy with allies or aloneand conquering lands one by one A great titleI also highly advise purchasing this for the newer communityGames so good that it gets new expansions 17 years after releaseCRTL  C to close the Validating Subscriptions windows and get into the main menuWhen I was a child I would play this game Now I bought it a second time because I want to be a child again  This is a game where you make an Empire that lasts through the Ages  Also when a friend of mine was telling me about this game when I was in third gradehe thought that it was called Agent Vampires  A game that has nothing to do with agents or vampires  Anywaygood game if you have friends who also want to be kids again ❤ Audience uOld but GoldubiWOOLOOLOOOibthis series has been over here for almost TWO FREAKING DECADES In 5 months itll be 2 years and people still want part 4 which most probably never come Since the last part its been over 1 years Do you guys even remember that book which was released by Microsoft Studios which showed up AoE 4 and 5 I guess we all believe there was suppose to be 45 Wasnt it actually Bill Gates who said hell look into that answer for question whats up with AoE 4growing or just lifetime in general as a gamer That game was is incredible 13 years later instead of Age of Empires IV weve recieved HD remaster Its easier to remaster something that was already done than create something new right Times of remastersthis remaster wasnt bad at all There are several pros Most importantlyfan base Secondly actual game at Steam Store no idea if there was SD editionif so write in comment please Another pros contains working and great multiplayeractual HD and the fact that you can just relive it all once againthat contains another campaign that  contains another campaign and same with The Conquerors  respective DLC content So if you dont feel to play Skirmish yet or Scenarios or just free build then do campaign But Skirmish at least for me is main element why Ive played this game And of course you start with nothingnowhereuneducated paesant and end up kinging your own Empire that will crush your enemies like nothingbuildingsunits and everything just like good old times Wonders are spectacular Architecture of new DLCs is also really beautiful NoIm not hard on DLC content whatsoever Game also have various game modes such as King of the HillWonder DefenseWonder DestroyingRelic CapturesDM and lot moresomebody is still going to enjoy it even after 5 hours Im on over 15 at the momentand I must say Im really exhausted So do your mathsometimes laggy as hell sometimes smooth as I dont knowskin of some smooth human being However it also depends on what you like Me personally I dont like big farming and just rushing everythingso I enjoy more playing MP with all friends in lobby so theres no serious rush But if you like opposite then hop into that MP or SP with hard CPU and it will be your heaventhats not Achievement for me Achievement should expose every element of the game possible Achievement should cover every existing aspect of the game or action you can done without holding you inside game for too long So if anybody thought it would be wise to put achievements like these in Age of Empires II HD was clearly nuts Yes it covers everythingbut it fairly exceeded anything saneGod created computers so that Age of Empires II could be played on themFirst time to play AoE II was in 1999but this ones still therea masterpiece across the agesPlaying FFA Regicide with friendsalliancesand betrayalmy city falls and I brace myself for defeatI see a message Anon has changed their status with you to allyI begin to rebuild my empireI see another messagemocking my defeatAge of Empires ll HD is one of the best Building Strategy Games  I´ve ever played Neither Offline or Onlineyou will have a lot of Fun So to to this Game I only can give a full recommendationI think its worth the moneyI have good memories of my dad teaching me how to play this RTS nearly 2 years ago  Almost 2 years later at this moment in time 17218 there are a total of 18423 players currently InGame  This stat should help to explain just how amazing this game truly isStarcraft and Command and Conquer  It would not surprise me if this game is still just as popular another 1 years from nowwhen I will have the privilege of sharing this experience with my kids somedayIts okbut I think I need to play it a bit more to be sure  Cautious thumbs up
1,I dont usually play action roguelikes Im in my 5s and my reflexes arent the honed blades they used to be Yetafter all the positive reviews I decided to give this game a goandboyam I having fun SureI suck 3odd escape attempts and the furthest I got is the bossfight in Elysiumbut its such a great game that I dont care Theres always something new to discover or progress to be made Highly recommendediOne more runijust one moreimaybe one more on top of thatione more and Im doneiI want to do another runijust let me do one more runiI thought I didnt like Rougelikes before Hades This game has completely changed my opinion on the genrei played this game for maybe an hourmy gf said hey that looks funcan i have a turnWhen you dieyou return home and pet the dog136 hours4949 achievements  sounds like just enough for the reviewneatly constructed plot and enjoyable gameplay with the classic easy to playhard to master aspect to itcrafted at the level we have come to expectno Adjustment to the progress in the one placeperhaps some slight balancing elsewhere But does it matter when taking everything into account Nopenot at allSomehowsome waySuperGiant managed to accidentally provide the best example of Games as a Service working by virtue of having the most intelligent Early Access schedule I have ever seencomplementing each system in place before and each system in place adapts to the new pieces  This feels like a puzzle that has no bordersand every time you get new pieces they just fit cleanly along the edge of the old to grow an even biggercooler picturebut then on top of that its such a damn good game  Combat feels incredible  Everything feels fair  Variable difficulty options and the bevy of interesting unlocks postfirstwin are a delight  There seems to be no end to little additions and new gameplay layers around every corner just when I think I have seen everything theyre gonna throw at me even if I havent unlocked it all yet  Its all so nuanced and delivered at such a perfect pace that I just cant keep myself from doing One More Attempt day in day outand while there are clear powerhouse options youd wish you saw every runeverything else is so useably good that you dont really notice when you dont get the OP options  Ohdid I mention the combat was fun  So are nearly all the variations and Roguelike RNG options  On top of thatthe expected god tier ha quality of writingmusicvoice actingand storytelling from Supergiant is in full force  Add that to the depth of interaction layers woven into the fightdierepeat loop directly as part of the lorewhich is done so remarkably smoothlyand you would not be wrong to wonder why not everyone on the planet follows in Supergiants footsteps from here on out for roguelikesand in a more broad sensefor Early Access as wellThis is Supergiant Games magnum opushowever since I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Supergiant Games previous titlesI gave this a chanceam I glad that I did  this game is just fantastic  The art style is beautiful with brilliant character designs  The soundtrack is excellentthe voice acting is spoton and the sound effects are great too  The story is interwoven with your repeated deathsprogressing multiple plot threads and relationships on every runfastpaced combat that takes cues from Bastion and Transistorbut dialled up to 11with the branching narrative of Pyre but with tons more replayability as the insane numbers of weapon upgradesboonsperks ensure that every run is differentmusicsound designstory all mesh together perfectlyyou can pet the big dogI dont know why this Fishing Simulator needed such a deep narrative and ballin soundtrackswhich I at first refrained frombecause there is WAY TOO MUCH to say about this game 125 hours in4949 achievements unlockedand I can hands down say that biHadesi is the best independent game I have beverb playedbthe greatest roguelite game and definitely in the top spots of all games Ive playedwithout any doubt or exaggeration iSupergiant Gamesi went all outand it shows iHadesi is definitely their Magnum Opus While Im on the topic of iSupergiant GamesiI can HIGHLY recommend watching the

of all time on Steamurlis breallyb showing that their efforts didnt go to wasteutterly enjoy every single aspect of iHadesi I dont even know where to begin This game just makes you crave for more iJust one more run Just one more run and Ill go to sleepiisometric art and animations are gorgeouswith everything being handdrawn to perfectionit strikes a perfect balance between visual flair and precise clarity needed to execute complex combos Everywhere you lookeverything you see is just so damn gorgeous and so pleasing for eyes The art style is a perfect match with the Greek mythology themeand each character just screams with their respective personalities All of the visual effectsalthough sometimes overbearingreally establish a great identity that will vary in each run and makes the game so aesthetically pleasingand evolving more upon dyingwas incorporated very cleverly You just get hookedevery run you learn more and more about why all of this takes placeits just satisfying All of this is so expertly drenched in myths and gravitas of the Greek mythologywhere you can feel that it was meticulously researchedthat it creates a very rich and immersive experience for the playerwhich is very well written it brilliantly incorporates humorintrospectionsternnessplayfulnessetc There are more than 2 lines of dialogue in this gameand quite some bigger AAA studios can definitely learn a thing or two from the completeness of iHadesi dialogue Its all just so fun to listen tothe protagonist Zagreus alone bears a classic drysardonic wit of late youth that breaks on occasion when his trespasses don’t go entirely according to plan The progression and the development of characters and their relationships to Zagreus is perhaps the best Ive ever seen in this particular genrehelleven in bigger titles They all range from wise and levelheaded to boisterous and sillyand the Greek pantheon in particular has some wonderfully clever takes on the classic deities More than anythingthoughis how relatable all of them come off as This isn’t some grim epic or intense dramait’s a guy trying to get out from under his dad’s thumb and running into all their mutuals along the way Some want to help himsome want to kill himand some just think the whole thing is too damn funny It’s a very human castand they’re an absolute delight to beholdsharp and well built It just 𝕗𝕖𝕖𝕝𝕤 𝕘𝕠𝕠𝕕 Addicting does not even remotely describe it It is so seamlessyet so effectivewithout talking down to you and holding your hand Youre given a fine selection of weapons and attacks and an incredibly versatile dash by default Each one can be upgradedaltered with different boons the gods will grant you Boons can modify your attacks or provide dramatic passive effects to bolster

extra dashes and so many more Zagreus can be an absolute blur on the battlefieldconstantly dashingslashingand bashing foes while weaving in and out of dangerand for my part the game does a fantastic job of keeping this highspeed mayhem manageable It almost reminds of DOOM in a wayhow the incredible speed and versatility of your character is balanced against huge numbers of enemies that will absolutely kill you if you make the mistake of standing stilleach time you go back to startyoure given the opportunity to acquire meaningful permanent upgrades which change the way you play and subsequently make things easier When you finally master iHadesi or have enough upgrades to give that edge in escapingyou may set the difficulty higher to go back to sweating bullets and getting new

is pretty goodh3iAdventure Through The Underworldih3the Greek mythologythemed game released one year agoand that purely conquested our hearts has playersOdysseusHerculesPerseusor even Herculesbut yes Zagreusson of Hades Howeverour young prince sees the Underworld position as overrated and desires to leave and join the rest of his family at Mount Olympus To perform this impossible task and go

expectedthe Olympus Gods didnt stay indifferent to the newssending their support to Zagreusbut Hades in that aspect is phenomenal The narrative will move the same way in the victories and losses Having when Zag gets back homecharacters making fun of himand some giving motivational speeches Its always good to get down there again to have a good chat with someonebut never for its combat HoweverHades feels fluid enough to be satisfying As referred beforethere are six different weaponseach having four unlockables aspects Every infernal arm has a different play stylehaving its own primary and special attackgiving a lot of variety to the game Without forgetting that gods are watching usthere are the boons Upgrades sent in lightspeed from the Olympus to support Zagreus These boons are passives that make our princefor examplegive more damage for attack or move fasterand when connected to the right weaponscan make a run three hundred times easiermostunlike boonsmaintain with Zagreus after completing a runused for several thingslike upgrades and cosmetics Its something that I dont bother withbut stillI think that there isnt a need to have soo much I would enjoy Hades the same way if there were only half of the artifactsand oh myits beautiful It doesnt fail any possible expectation about it It presents a junction of 2D and 3Dwith the pillars popping up to your eyes Animations and movements look soft and clean And the character designforget itits another leveland I think thats enough to say that I still listen to the OST todayand who enjoys roguelikes that doesnt touch this gameor says thats baddoesnt know what is saying GB RamiHello allpermadeath games usuallyI have to say im very impressed with this gamefun and a little addictive The runs themselves last about 36mins but the story and dialogue just keeps on going Fail the first time and come back strongerunlock skills and so much more to make your next run much more easierand for those who like it difficult have the ability to crank it up a notch once you have completed your first runno bugs or glitches just very cleanthe achievements alone will keep you locked in this game for hours n hoursI love itworth every penny ImpressiveI dont like roguelikes  or roguelites Dont get me wrongIve tried Ill buy some wellreviewed game like Enter the Gungeonboot it upplay for an hour or twothen let it sit in my library until time immemorial Its a cycle I was loath to repeat which is why despite enjoying the rest of Supergiants games I stayed away from Hades for about a yearrocking soundtrackand tight combat or about how Cerberus is a good boy These are all trueand if you already like the roguelike genre should sell you on this gamebut if youre like me thats not enough The reason Ive played more of this game than any other roguelike is because of Supergiants ability to combine story and gameplay In a lesser gamepicking up a powerup consists of a menu screen or a short visual cuebut in Hades picking a boon means learning more about the crazy gods on mount olympus Is Poseidon jealous of Zeus Does Athena resent Ares Is Dionysis drunk  Youll get to experience all of these little dramas and more as you progress through a runbut where Hades really sets itself apart from the rest of genre is what happens after a runits like coming homefrom hypnos the sleepy doormanyour mentor Achillesto mother night herself Not to mention the adorable housekeeper Sometimes its not about Zagreusbut the relationships all of these colorful characters have which each other which will develop over each failure as you return to the house of Hades Afterwards I can unlock new weapons or weapon aspectsnew powerupsor see the new items Ive collected and prepare for my next run Its a thoroughly satisfying loopso even if you dont think this is your type of gameyou should give it a shotHades is one of the best roguelites of alltime Gameplay is fast and full of never ending action The boons that you earn in each dungeon significantly alter your abilities in interesting ways Theres a great deal of replayability due to random generated mapsrandom skills you get each run and different skillsets Boss fights are hard and require a lot of focus but they are not tedious at allon the contrary theyre very engaging Hades does a great job of balancing fun and challengeSupergiant returns with a masterpiecewith a roguelite one Dont let the title fool youyou wont be playing as Hades youll be playing his son Zagreus who decided that he wants to run away from home But wait I hear you say Hades never had a son And Zagreusif even mentionedis just an aspect of Dionysus And youd be right Supergiant actually did their Greek mythology research to the point where in a few thousand yearsthe story of this gamecould even seem as a legit myth from the period that addresses that little identity crisis in a meta sense Big applause for this Other than thatof coursekeeping the game family friendlysome details of the Olympian family tree had to be left outthis game will have you repeatedly fight out of the land of the deadcollecting resources and upgrades as you goso you can press further next time The difficulty curve is up to the player  if youre strugglingyou can activate the God Mode which will give you some damage resistance and stack a bit of it on top every time you die If you want to selfflagellatethen theres Hell Mode which will put you against extra challenges with tougher and more plentiful foesright off the bat Once you finish a run onceyou can stack such challenges onto your run freely for additional rewards Its fastpacedbut never makes you feel youre under time pressureand the number of builds you can go for with different weapons and boons from Olympian gods is vastso dont get too focused on a single playstyleits another brilliant entry into the Supergiant collectionand the banter between the characters never gets tedious Alsospoiler alert You can pet Cerberus All lines are fully voicedand they even breathe some personality into each Hellenic person of myth And the overarching quest would be a spoilerbut suffice to sayZagreus has good reasons to try and run away from homeand also good reasons to always end up back thereas weve been learning to expect from these hoopy froods at Supergiant All in allits a worthy purchaseandand I cant believe Im saying thisbut I actually wish Id bought this one in Early Access Definitely recommended to anyone who enjoys a good rogueliteofcI got everything Everything I got every single thing I cant get any more upgradesbountiescontractsminor propheciesthe codex is full I got everything This game is incredible to get lost inagain and again and again I couldnt recommend it enough to anyone whose a fan of roguelikesgreek mythologytwin stick shootersand gays 11I WANT MORE maybe a DLCpleaseIts their best game yet  the gameplaycharactersmusicits absolutely unparalleled The fact its not even finished yet astonishes me  this is already perfect enough
1,Base game itself doesnt offer too muchInstallReview is based on gameplay with G2U want a honest reviewsooo yea i have 4000hrs in this and yes i have played this since it first came outi have time to kill im retired basicallymind you this sim is almost 8yrs oldgoes on sell quite often after you have setup your wheel and pedals properly or with controller or keyboardAND get your FOV dialed inwell its age shows right there whoozedoes just fine though some cars do feel extremely glued to the road or have broken aerodynamics or just drive like bricks  so if u think ur going to just get in a Mclaren P and do some drifts like u seen on a few yt videos well best of luckbut hey nothing is perfect especially something this old still does better than games like gts or pc23 imoCSP Custom Shaders PatchCM Content MangerPPF PostProcessingFilters this sim looks like it belongs in a game trailer from this yeardont believe me Just go inside the Screenshot channels of a DECENT AC discord server and lookim not going to get into detail about because it would take forever to explain but to put it as short as possible there are some mods that look and drive worse than stock AC and there are mods that are just so much fun and everything feels natural u can get lost in this sim for hrs and hrsjust ask around in a DECENT AC discord server or go to RaceDepartmentodds are youll end up in argument with kids or adults who should honestly get off and get a jobNo one will ever read this but I recommend this gameIm not very good at reading Steam descriptions I somehow managed to miss the part where this was a simulatorand believed it would be a Forzastyle racing gameor maybe a Gran Turismo experience I wasnt prepared for the depth of simulation presented in this game I had no racing equipmentnot even a steering wheel I did not enjoy the gamedo some drifting and jump out Its an indepth driving game with realistic vehicles and handling It is recommended to get racing sim equipmentbut you dont have to Dont make the mistake I didand make sure you figure out whether Assetto Corsa is right for you If youunlike meare interested in an intense and realistic racing experiencethis is the game for youPlayed in VR and it is extremely immersive Crashed at 300kmgot whiplashand went into shock Woke up three weeks later from a coma with my kidneys gone Anyway 00 great

game is the best RacingDrifting Simulator Game Becauseif not the biggesteven though its a 204 gamea 5 YO pcand new PC that I bought just to play this game in VR but Im writing this one Because I Recommend this game for any Car EnthusiastThe base game of assetto corsa isnt the reason many players love this game For sureit has a lot of good content and you could be content with just playing the game stockbut the real experience comes in mods Do you want a pictureperfect recreation of the tokyo highway system A full set of 70s touring cars A realistic rally mode You can get all of those on the internet This game has essentialy unlimited contentand that is what makes it greatAssetto Corsa In shortbuy this game if you have a wheeland if its on salebut only buy the ultimate edition The base game itself is very lacking in content So I recommend you get urlhttpsassettocorsaclubcontentmanagerhtml Content Manager url too It makes downloading mods b much b easier You probably also want a lot of modssince the number of cars are limited in the base game Heres some sites I recommendcarsAssetto Corsa is basically a pure perfection It is one of the best racing gamessimulators ever madeI am a casual gamer I play racing games with a gamepadand with all assists on And despite the fact that Assetto Corsa is labelled as a hardcore driving simulatorin realitythis is an extremely accessible gameeven for fans of arcade racing games like medo yourself a favor and buy Assetto Corsa Dont bother with that abomination called Project CARS I had extremely high hopes for Project CARS series It seemed that these games had everything  beautiful graphicsamazing soundsplenty of tracks and cars to drive But to my disappointmentcars and handling in Project CARS games are utter garbage Physics are a complete joke Every second car spins out when exiting from the cornerand playing these games with the gamepad is impossible Not to mention super toxic online communityand tons of fanboys who defend pCARS despite its horrible flawsas well as responsive brakesand overall behaviorif you install communitymade modssuch as CSPSol and Horizonthe Assetto Corsa will look better than any other racing gaming currently available on the marketthis game has thousands of mods You can mod everything Everything You can mod graphicsweatherinstall new carsinstall new tracksadd new liveriesadd custom

fact that its seven years old It features tons of contentand is super accessible both for arcade racing driversas well as for sim racing drivers The Assetto Corsa Competizione is the best GT3 racing game ever made Howeverthe Assetto Corsa is currently a more featurerich game thanks to the amazing community which supports it I think the future of this series is brightespecially since its able to

1,I am not a big gamer  Im old  Over 5  When I purchased a new computer recentlywanting to take it for a spinI asked my son what to do and he told me about Steam  As an ancient history buff Im also a writer and have written a novel about the ancient SpartansI did searches on Greece and Rome and eventurally found Rome 2a lot of gamers just cant wait todayI love Rome 2  When I read about the Emperors Edition having worked out most of the problemsI dove in  Its been a delight  What a great game  Its more addicting that crack  Being able to play so many different factions gives it limitless replayability  Thus far Ive played as the RomansSpartansAthenians and Epirusand have had a blast with each  There is a huge amount of strategy and tactics available on both the campaign map and the battle maps  Placing your armies at choke points in the mountains or at river crossings putting them in ambush mode slaughtering 2x or 3x your number of units without getting your hands dirty its all so gratifyingeventually Ill start kicking out armies composed of better units than my opponents  When the autoresolve gives me results I dont likesaying Im going to loseor take unexceptable lossesits fun to take control of your army and lead them on to victory when the oddsmakers are betting against you  Of courseoften times youre leading superior units against hordes of untrained spearmen or leviesbut occasionally the computer gives you a run for your money and theres nothing like destroyng your opponents Praetorian guard or Oathsworn unit that fights to last manI found the Workshop and have been in pure amazement at the products the community has added to the game  The 4x moves per year modagent color codingthe new unit modsand many others deserve effusive praise  I feel like a kid on Christmas morning every time I look in the Workshopwondering what new toy Ill find under the tree todayokaythere are somebut Im like a newlywed on his honeymoon right now  I dont care if she leaves her panties on the bathroom floor or that the 4x calendar year mod makes agents overpowered  For right nowIm enjoying the game far too much to complain about a thingRome wasnt built in a day It took 5 years and 18 patchesThis game received a lot of negativity when it came out I didnt play it at release so a large percentage of the hate was probably well deserved In the end thoughI really feel this title is one of the best in the series I think the battle AI is the best of the series still havent played Attila though The game looks and sounds beautiful in all aspectsit really makes sense You can still recruit troops away from a city and they magically appear in the queue on the next turn within your army which means they ARE marching from one location to anotheryou just arent the one doing itit was a file that somehow got corrupted and simply verifying the integrity of the game cache resolved it entirelythe campaigns I have played in this game have been some of the best to date and I highly recommend this title to anyone interested in historical strategy To those who love this series but havent played this game yet I say give it a try and give it more than just a few turns Put a few hours into it before calling it quitsGame is worth it on sale for 17  but not 71 its 7 years old you gouging bastardsI guess there were some serious issues at launch but Rome II  EE is a pretty great TW game There are issues with the game becoming a major slog midlate gameonce youve pretty much dominated your neighborsbut the combat is fun and the graphics look good Some people dont like how resources are now managed at the province leveland you can no longer build every little town into a rival of Romabut reallyits a non issue once you get the hang of managing food and learning what to build and wherefrom minor music enhancementsto complete overhauls This certainly extends the replayability of the game once you get done with the included scenarios which are goodespecially teutoburg forestI dont understand how I bought the Definitive edition of a game and still have over £9 of DLC to buySince the release of the Rise of the Republic DLCyou can no longer mod the game Agent behavior and AI player actions can be changed in the game code same as beforebut those changes now for some reason have no effect After posting questions on the Steam Mod Workshop and also on TWC and waiting three months with zero responsesit seems clear that nobody knows how to fix thisand nobody is answering questions about it on the forumsso this is my only way to express my displeasure about the situation I really hope someone notices how the mods are being prevented from working right and fixes it Until then one of my favorite games of all time is off my play listGood game with a ridiculous price How is this still 6 I was going to buy it for a friend but not for 6 That is ridiculousRome wasnt patched in a dayRome wasnt patched in a dayIm writing this review for new eyes thatll see the 75 discountthere is a steep learning curve If youve played Civilizationyou wont have a hard time adjustingI think The tutorials are barebonesand will not prepare you well enough Take a look at the Total War Academy and go on youtube to see gameplay before purchasing This game requires prep time before purchasing Keep that in mindfolksabout the DLC There are 13 of them Ill do the math for you The complete version is 19886 when not on saleand as of todayMay 14thit would be 641 YesIm including Blood and Gore Why are blood effects DLC now Whats next Will the game remain silent until I pay for it This may sound like a first world problembut this should have been a free update Reviews on that page will echo thismods are availablebut this is a review of the base gameand you might like it toothis ones for youArmed with a new engineRome II looks greatplays smoothlyand will be a challenge to both veterans and novicesRome 2 was extremely bugged upon release and infuriated countless fansincluding die hard Total War fans With the release of the Emperor Editionmost of all these bugs and performance problems had been successfully adressedmaking this entry one of the best that Total War had and has ever seenI still enjoy replaying campaigns just for the heck of it Meaning bingeplaying for weeks at end and still not getting bored ❤ Audience While I adore this gameand applaud CAs work in advancing the mechanics and elements of its preeminent series on a title to title basisI cannot stand the pay wall antics theyve indulged in of late Leaving X number of factions inaccessible to players is absurdand I have to conclude from the innumerable reviewsrants Ive come across expressing this same sentiment that its a poor business practicedecision You make a more or less singular productwhich subsequently has a more or less singular audienceif the rise of independent gamemakers has not left you with the following impression alreadyallow me to reiterateindys will remake your game and subsequently make it better by catering to the whims of fansthus depriving you of the user base you now enjoy If thats the future you envision for your seriesCAby all means keep nickel and dimeing people to vexation I for one have not purchased any CA title since the release of Rome II and have no plans to do otherwiseunless of course I observe a leavingoff on your part with respect to the aforementioned I hope this review finds an audiencethough I rather doubt itI suppose most developers are under the mistaken impression that the gaming community no longer has members willing to boycott a productseriesRome 2 had a rough startbut has evolved over time to become my favourite Total Warcovering all of the major and some of the minor players in this era Theyre spread across four large Cultural Groups RomanHellenicBarbarian and Easterneach of which have different fighting stylesbuildings etc and 9 Cultureseach offering different traits and bonuses And while factions within the same culture may be similareach still has some unique units and specific challenges that I feel adds to the replayabilityyou need the Greek States DLC to play as the likes of AthensEpirus and Spartathough as with all DLC factions you can fight against them in the Grand Campaign without the DLC I personally dont see it as an issue as in the period the main game is actually set 272BC to 72AD theyre already past their glory daysand with the various Successor Kingdoms such as MacedonEgyptand the Seleucids theres still plenty of Greek combat on offerbut still holds up well in my view and are now tied to a particular General or Admiral so you recruit from the armynot the settlementsthough what you can recruit is based on the buildings in that province Theres also now a cap on the number of armies and navies each faction can fieldthough this can be increased through Imperium This means you generally dont have lots of little armies swarming all over the place And while this does mean theres a small loss of strategic flexibilityI find it also means you have to put more strategic thought into where you place your limited armiesbut also penalties for conquering territory and growing your empire As it gets bigger your Imperium level increasesallowing you to field more armies and agentsas well as enact more edicts province wide bonuses but also introduces new governance and logistical issues represented by increases in corruptiondisloyalty and unit upkeep costsespecially since the Power  Politics and Ancestral Updates Whoever you play youll find you have one or more other partieswho have their own charactersparty traits such as liking Barbarianshating Romans or being Pacifists and territory within your empire Each has a loyalty statwhich then increases or decreases depending on your actionsthe characters work the same as the ones from your party But if their party loyalty falls too low theres a chance a Secession or full blown Civil War will trigger each turncausing part of your empire to break away taking with it any armies and navies lead by their characters or spawning additional armiesnavies if the party doesnt have sufficient militaryso youll never be in a position where you dont have a political opposition for long Overall it adds a whole additional dimension to the campaignsso the threats you face arent just from other factionsbut also your ownwhere the heirs to Julius Caesar such as Octavian and Mark Anthony fought to become the first Roman Emperor While it reuses many features of the Grand Campaignits still a fun change of pace to play as or fight against large established Roman factionsits worth noting its all completely optional so its really up to the player what to buy You only need to buy the DLC to play as that contentnot fight against it in Grand Campaignso for example youll get to fight against the Nomadic Tribes with their full DLC rosters even if you never buy their DLCRome 2 offers a lot of content for the price which is why Im still playing 7 years and some 24 hours after release so if youre interested in the periodstrategy games or Total War Id highly recommend itIve had dreams about conquering the Mediterranean because of this game Ive spent literal months of my life playing thisWhile I rather enjoyed this gameway back whendespite its many flawsin 214 or soI paid less for it then that it costs nowand there is certainly no excuse to pricehike a 7 year old game it was released in 213to 6 euro  15 euro worth of DLC75 off sale The 7 year old game  DLC will only cost you 65 euroAfter 7 hoursI can still say I find this game fantastic Massive fan of Roman history so its a big plus for meyes the graphics are getting a little outdated and the AI isnt all that bright but you just cant beat the concept of fighting with armies from that timewhere you would have to defend Italy from hordes of slaves or even try to take out Italy fighting as the slaves Dgreat game would recommend this for sureI am giving a quick review because I strongly believe that after what CA did with the game postrelease it has become one of my favourite TW gamesVaried FactionsNew Province System Gives you miniobjectives that add some structure to the campaignArmy System and TraditionsGreat audio and musicLots of DLCAgents They are both too powerful and their risk is not satisfying at allDiplomacy Better than before but still feels randomLots of DLCWar ElephantsHorse ArchersChariotsHeavy CavalryBallista  So much varietyevery TW player must try this game It is a good starting point for new TW players as it is by far more streamlined than the old games For better or for worse
1,The title is a lieyou die more than twiceWhen I first got the gameI liked it  Then I met the first miniboss and died a lot  I got better  Watched quite a few walkthroughs and tips videos  I hated everything about it  The Iframesthe enemy fight timingsthe death mechanicsthe Ogreoh that damnablestinking ogre  I never hated a character more until I had to fight Lady Butterfly  Then about 0 hours inI just got it  I understood  Then I was able to appreciate the landscapesthe questsand the story line I got my platinum in about 43 hours  Ive played through about 38 timesconquered all DLC gauntletsand still love playing it  I can now do a full run through in about 10 hours if I play all the side quests and kill all there is to kill  Still hate the Headless though  1007 hours and still love it  I probably cant play anything else that From Software has nowbut that is okay  Ill still give the Souls series a try at some point  Looking forward to Elden Ringcontrary to popular belief you in fact die way more than twiceSekiro is not a Souls game This cant be stressed enough Attempt to iframe dodge through the game and you will get your ass slapped all the way back to Lordran While it borrows certain elements from Soulslike the checkpoint system or cryptic NPC questlinesits pretty much its own beast And what a beast it isbad news situations Good news the days when you needed to keep an eye on your stamina for every attackblock or dodge are over Bad news that doesnt mean the game is any less challenging Quite the oppositeactually Wolfie goes down in two hits topsand at all times hes either heavily outnumbered or he gets crushed in the health bar measuring contest And the absence of statsgear and online coop means there are no shortcuts You wont be able to overlevelno Solaire will come to your aid Its either nut up or shut upthere are ways to put you at a lesser disadvantage Sekiro features a rudimentary stealth system and enough freedom to thin out your enemies ranks one by one Most of the times you can clear entire areas just by being sneaky ApparentlySekiro started out as a Tenchu game and I totally believe itconsidering how far stealth will get you But eventually a direct confrontation will be unavoidable And where Souls games required you to only land that one parrySekiro demands that you time your blocks near perfectly several times per exchange Combat is fastfluid and demanding enough to make you break a sweatthey are not exactly eyecandy Souls games are known for their sinister beautybut that is largely absent in Sekiro Some areas look flatout rough Only rarely will you get the urge to stop and soak in the atmosphere A missed opportunityreally And while the environments leave room for explorationthe absence of cool gear makes it feel strangely unrewarding Alsodue to the nature of combat you will see the same instakill moves and finishers quite often A bit of variety would have been niceSekiro faces its own set of challenges Developer From Software has been around for over three decadesbut only since the release of Demons Souls the studio has gained a larger recognition in the West Ever sincemost of their games have been Souls games either directly or in spirit Being widely known as the developer of Souls games came with the issue that they were expected to make nothing but Souls games  a curseif you will Sekiro marks the first time in a while that a major From Software title branches out far enough to be called its own thing  and be accepted by a large audience With that leap of faith out of the wayitll be exciting to see what they will come up with nextI was boredand saw that this game won game of the yearso I bought itdying repeatedly to the games first minibossI contacted steam and demanded a refund for a game I simply couldnt playand after finally killing that first minibossI couldnt get over how I felt I kept goingperfecting the fighting style until I reached the games first real boss It knocked me down again I fought that boss over and over again until the swordplay became a lethal kind of dance I felt invincible After the first bossI went onto the next oneand the nextuntil I completed the games first ending Then I played it all againexploring the abilitiesfighting stylesand story arcs that I hadnt tried before I reached the games truly final boss and killed it in one try because the game had trained me to fight so well It was by far the most rewarding experience any video game has ever given me After over 150 hoursI earned every single achievementfrom someone who would have never been remotely interested in Japanese culture otherwiselet me tell you that Sekiro is one of a kind Not only is the combat an artform in and of itselfbut the story is moving and the characters compellingdont get frustrated when you hit a wall Dont look up cheese strategies or try to savescum the game Get back upwatch a walkthrough or two if you really need toand vault over that wall like a fing shinobi You wont regret itNow I just want Bloodborne for PCSekiro is not a game I would easily recommend to those who dislike the Souls games Never in a million years would I recommend this to someone whos totally unfamiliar with difficult action games Nor do I think those who loved the Souls series primarily for its world designnarrative or multiplayer elements will particularly enjoy this gameSekiro is one of the best games ever madeI instinctively shrugged such complaints off Similar statements were made about all of the previous gamesand they were never true But about 17 hours inafter getting beat by the same boss so many times that I could dodge their moves without even looking at the screenI thought Oh That kind of IS what theyre going for this time It only became more apparent as I continued to progresswhen you see someone playing an action gameand said person utilizes every possible opportunity to deal damage without missing a beatwhile simultaneously dodging every attackfor upwards of four minutes on an extremely capable enemyyou would assume that this person has mastered the game This sort of capability is what Sekiro expects from iall playersi as a ibaselinei In almost all casesimusti get to the point where you understand an encounter on an absolute level in order to beat it If you do notyou will diethen you will die againfar more than twiceincluding your toolset I have never seen a game with a higher number of useful toolstechniques and items than Sekiro The Shuriken cuts down those who leap in mid airthe Firecracker stuns the abnormally frantic beasttype enemies and blinds any other enemythe Sabimaru is exceptionally quick and provides poison that not only deals damage over time but inflcits stagger Even something as basic as shards of pottery or a fistful of ash have proved incredibly useful in certain circumstances This is a ihugei setup from the Dark Souls series where half of every spell type is totally useless and a quantum leap from Dark Souls 3 where all but two or three weapon arts were complete garbage The reason why these tools are so amazingof courseif that the game expects you to use them With the exception of the basic enemiesnothing you meet will ever be outright trivialized or even made dramatically easier with these toolsin the way that sayFour Kings could be made easy with Havels or Dragonrider could be instantly killed with a welltimed jump Almost alwaysif a tool is good within a given circumstanceit is good because it allows you to more easily pressure an enemy with your swordthe tools just make that learning process easier For a lot of peopleI think that may be interpreted as an unreasonable demandas opposed to how its described in the gameis a reinforcing feedback loop that punishes you for dying over and over through an implicit threat that dying results in the slowgradual death of friendly NPCs Maybe implicit isnt the worditd be closer to say that the game outright lies to youbecause none of these NPCs ever actually die or even close off their services because of dragonrot Not even if you die a million times Not only thatbut you can very easily produce a cure for dragonrotthough a temporary one If you start dying over and over againthe dragonrot will return To meit was a total nonissuedespite dying well over a hundred times Im at the end of the gameno one has dragonrotand I have four cures ready to gowhen a game implements a system of negative reinforcementits to prevent sloppy play But there are no actual consequences of dragonrotits a mild inconvenience at best So why would From Software commit to a mechanic that has a tendency to induce panic and confusion in new playersbut doesnt really deter sloppy play at all for those who actually understand the mechanicand the dragonrot system is there to act as a narrative means to all but outright scream at you to get better as quickly as possible There are other reasons why I think thisthere are two bosses you can encounter within the first six hours of the game that are shockingly difficult and complex by conventional standard One boss in particularthough optionalis the equivalent of putting Lady Friede in the Cursed Trees place Before playing Sekiroif you asked me if a boss with eight different attacks that can sometimes veer off into feints that all requires different responses and have enough damage to kill a player in two hits would be okay for the first third of the gameI would say Are you absolutely insane Of course not And indeedwhen I first encountered these bosses I suspectedbased on Froms track recordthat these bosses were way overtuned and that the end bosses would be a joke in comparison Nope As difficult as these bosses arethey actually are unequivocally easier than the endgame bosses Which is why theyre placed so early to begin withone could potentially avoid all damage by learning when to commit to rollswhichordinarilywas not particularly difficult The continuous reliability of the rollin tandem with each new sequel making stamina management easier and easiermeant that experienced players could no longer be challenged by conventional Souls encounters Gimmicks were required to spice things upalmost all of which crashed and burnedand several introduced ways for combat to get even easier than it already wasall made in the name of providing a nearly insurmountable challengeone that can no longer be vaulted overas the Souls challenges so often couldmiss the cheese But this is a game that knows exactly what it wants It wants you hyperfocused It wants your commitment It wants instinctlevel reactions It IS a game that is difficult for the sake of being difficultthat is the point Claiming it is a game for masochists is honestly true on some level It will only be fun for those who opt in entirely to the experience Anything less and you will find yourself appalled The beauty and amazing level designthe fantastic musicthey exist only for those who want an absolutely insane gauntlet of challenges Its a videogame fight clubone Im not sure I even want to be inits SekiroDont go in expecting a Soulsborne gameI think its a brilliant move FromSoft has set a narrative with this that makes for a real story to be told with the playerrather than AT the player like in other FromSoft titlesyou own everything currently available for itand doing some QA testingas wellRelease bloodborne for steamStarted playing this after finishing the Dark Souls series Looked similarplayed similaralrightI got thisI diedand contrary to every DS game I playedI didnt seem to improve I just raged more and more as the dragonrot kept piling up I felt myself going hollowso I took a breakread about other peoples experience with the game Maybe it just wasnt for me I meanlooksome people on Reddit thought it suckedrestarted from the beginningforgot everything I knew about how to play a FromSoftware gamestarted to play more agressivlyparried everything no matter how scary the attack or weapon lookedbecame bffs with mikiri counter Started having funtheres that feeling I had back in the day playing DS1 for the first timelearning a bossimproving with every deathfinally breezing through phase 1 only to repeat the process for phase  and so on What an epic fight that was Finally beat him and decided to put my excitement into a review Love this gamethere are monkeys in this gamecan write death in japanese nowDont get turned off thinking this game is for people with mad skills and reflexes and suchnever wasand Ill be 40 years old in a few months Other than WoWI mostly stuck to turnbased  rpgs into my 30s And Im telling youjust as with Dark Soulsthere are enough git gud guides that help immensely to make it beatable for people such as me You will be challenged You will get frustrated sometimes You will also learnand victory will be all the sweeter because of itDark Souls but you can also understand whats going onI normally dont write reviews about games especially critically acclaimed games such as this one Sekirohowever really deserved something to be said about it I have never been a fan of the souls series but i respect what they done for gaming and the difficulty they presented so i expected to be frustrated while figuring out the initial learning curce  The first playthrough of this game was one of the most challenging experiences I have ever had in gamingbut when I finally understood the game mechanics and practiced them i truly understood what a work of art it actually is It reminded of actual fighting and how a split second opening can make or break a battle I played this game to the extent that the combat became second nature and i would go on autopilot and just flow in battle much like an actual fight where you really dont have time to think you just have to react and flow This game has made me a better gamer and taught me how not to fear a challenge but embrace it and even seek it i recently just started playthrough number 4 and i have beaten every boss and miniboss in the game and i can say i am satisfied with the game and i consider it finished Sekiro was and is worth every penny I paid for it Its an absolute must play game and a classicPlaying through Sekiro for the first time was the greatest gaming experience of my life Never has a game meant so much to methis game is pure immersionIt speaks to you in every detail And the difficulty drives you deep into the this immersive experiencewhere you find yourself gritting your teethriveted to the screen and fighting with all your might to just stay in it a little longer To deflect and to dodge and to land just one more hitSekiro had me falling out of my chairstunned with the realization of what I must do Twice The resurrection mechanic just further enriches the experienceforcing you to become the ultimate shinobi master and and not only beat a bossbut completely to annihilate it or at the very least to just barely outlive itsurviving and succeeding by the tiniest of marginsthis game is just a treasure It excels in areas Dark Souls cannot Being provided with only one main weapon means makes for a finely tuned PVE combat experience that is much more immersive than the other Souls games and you dont have any choice about it You are forced to master these new mechanicsand quickly find yourself grappling aroundsprintingdodgingdeflectingand then destroying enemies and bosses that will leave your breathless with their magnificence I could say morebut I dont want to spoil it for anyoneno youtubeno reading about it Just play the game You just stumbled upon the greatest 1player game of all time Immerse yourself in it Enjoy the experienceMy first glimpse of this game was during a LAN party sometime last year My friend had told me a little bit about the game and showed me one of the bosses that he was still trying to beat I thought the game looked coolbut kept it in the back of my mind and didnt think of it much I later on asked him about it again and he showed me even more gameplay and I knew I had to try this game He got me a copy of the game and I had no idea what I was in for I had never played a FromSoftware game before so I came in with a completely clean slate Truth be toldI got my ass kickedlike really bad It took me almost 4 hours to beat the chained ogre alone and I was ready to quit even after conquering that miniboss but I pushed on I pushed on until I got to Genichiro in the high castle When I tell you I have seen the beginning of that cutscene with him looking down from the castle over 100 timesI am not exaggerating I worked for days on this boss I watched walkthroughscheesestipstricksadviceanything and everything None of it was working I came to realize that the game had a certain way it wants you to playit wants to teach you how to winit wants to show you that you cant force your way or luck your way through a tough fight I learned how to parryI learned how to dodgeI learned how to counterI learned how to play this game the way it was meant to be played I bought this game on steam for 3 reasons1 I wanted all the cool updates and stuff  I wanted to have it in my library forever 3 I wanted to write this review I want you to know that if you might buy this gameif you are even THINKING about buying this gamedo it You may be in the same situation as I waslosing and working on bosses for hours on endbut when I tell you that its worth itit is You cant understand how truly worth it it is until you perform that final deathblow on a boss you have been working and working and working on This is hands down my favorite video game of all time I will cherish this game and the experiences I have had with it foreverClashing of swords at its finestit becomes the danceyou can use tons of tools fit into the prosthetic armboth offensive and defensive Or you can ignore them completely and only use your sword It doesnt have the variety of customization like in an RPGbut what it hasit is made perfectits hardit requires you to git gudand you will die a lot and suffer I had so much rage during some of the fightsyet I have never even considered a rage quit The learning curve of the difficulty is quite balanced once you start to feel comfyit gives you another challenge So youll never get boredeven after beating the game you can go for additional NG playthroughs and make the game harder yesharder Just give up Kuros charm and ring the demon bell Dthis game has some more to offer The stunning visuals of mountainous Japanfilled with gorgeous castles and templesdetailed armor of human warriors and fascinating creatureswhichas I suspectare inspired by Japanese mythology The game on the whole feels very Japanesebut it doesnt require you to know almost anything about their culture beforehand The story is clear and quite linearyet you can have 4 different endings There are not so many charactersbut each one of them has a story to tell Plus some pieces of lore can be found in item descriptions and environment If you pay attention the lore becomes more deep and complexFromSoftwareEvery other action game seems kinda bad after playing thisIf you see a small white monkey with  swords R U N
1,I cant explain this without getting emotionalbut every gamer has that one game that one memorywhere it was just yousome friends and an absolutely great time For me that time was Tekken 3with family back in 97I get emotional writing this reviewbecause this game is not just a high quality PC portit is an amazing port of my childhoodmy memoriesin every way that is a good thing The game looks like Tekkenonly prettier than ever before This game feels like Tekenand honestlythere is very little that I as a gamer appreciate more than a game genuinely crafted with passion that captures a memory  A game that allows me to relive some of the happiest moments of my life and make for great new storiesI highly recommend you get this soon as you canI love how this game makes you pay to view frame data It really gives you a sense of pride and accomplishmenthitboxesand more in practice modePlayed this with my dad 3 Best quality father daughter timelol wtf a fighting game that works day 1 with working

quit league of legends 1010My favourite combo is ALT F4still needed to pay for a character even though i bought the ultimate edition im so sick of this practiceFinally a release that is playable and you know what you are paying foryou can easily train with ondisplay character combosclothes that dont really fit character styleFinally a Tekken game for PC Tekken finally has a PCport and its fantasticshort loadtimes and tons of peripheral support This is a perfect example of a series transitioning to PC If you like fightinggamesthis is an absolute mustbuybut a massive skillceiling You can buy this game and have a fantastic time even if you have never played a fighting game before For the serious player the game features insane depth and a lot to enjoy Tekken 7 has changed things such as throwbreaking and made things generally more streamlinedbut maintained its complexety and depth This really is the best Tekken has ever beenthe roster is tightened up Your favorite is most likely still in the game and the newcomers are generally good Each character feels unique and I feel Namco has made good decisions on which characters to keepthe game has techinally been complete This begs the question of what in the fuck Namco has been doing for 2 years Customization is a joke compared to Tekken 6 and there are very few modes There is also no replaymode or anything outside the basic ranked onlinethe customization is especially sadening considering that there are so few characters and one would assume this means more options for each onebut its basically a bunch of CGcutcenes tied together with a terrible narrator and a hamfisted plot The story makes no sensebut I cant really fault the game for it Tekken has always been bonkers Howevercompared to many other fighters it really falls flat and it has to be pointed out considering that the game offers very little other contentbut there is only a question of time until someone bodies you Its easy to feel lost in this gameyet the game makes very little effort to teach you anything You are going to end up on YouTube and other sites to figure out combosframedata etc and that isnt good There should at least be something here to teach new players the basicsragequitting is a SERIOUS problem There is basically no punishment for quitting and if a player disconnects on youyou dont get the win This becomes an even bigger problem in Tekkens tournamentmode If the host gets mad he can kick you immediately or outright leave to shut down the entire lobby As a resultplaying Tournamentmode is rather difficultthis is also frustratingly difficult It can take 34 requests before you can accept a request to fight that actually works As a result you will often end up in games with 3bar connections because the game has not been able to connect to the players that fit the criteria you searched for Most of the time you will be told that the connection to the opponent has been lost You might think that this is your potential opponent declining your requestbut in the majority of times it is in fact the game struggling to connect Howeverthis will most likely be fixed and when it happens I will remove this from the reviewevery time I boot up this game I want to kill myselfTekken 7 is my first fighting game that Ive decided to take seriouslythe customisation allowed for each character is fairly large and overall the gameplay itself is fantastic The movement in this game feels great and the combat itself is quite intensealong with some slow motion moments that pump you with adrenalinethe game runs completely fine without any hiccups i54670kGTX 1060 6GB and the load times are very shortfor new players to Tekkenis the lack of tutorials Some could argue that the story mode is the tutorialbut thats unacceptable The story mode misses out a huge portion of mechanics hidden within the gamesuch as all of your recovery options when youre slammed onto the groundoutside of learning by yourself through practice mode or online matchesis to research tutorials and mechanics onlineNearly 1000 hours of playing This game is still fun as the 1st dayand Im really hyped for the upcoming Season Pass 4pluggerswho are very diversehence IT HAS BECOME MORE ABOUT COMPLEXITY RATER THAN DEPTHdont sell the ultimate edition and not give all dlcs its scummy and needs to stopif you like the game get it

1,Spawned as a Scientistand was a lone survivor since the SCPs killed almost every other DBoyScientist Found an MTF trying to help me with the most soothing voice I have ever heard in my life After what felt like an hour of escaping from the SCPs our friendship grow as we end up being trapped in a roomwhich was being camped by two SCPsand we proceed to talk to each other how badly we wanted to go on living and told us stories of what we wanted to achieve in lifelike see our wives again and visit other countriesalmost crying whilst doing soand while it did workhe died in the process I usually feel great accomplishment when I escape the facilitybut I only felt emptiness Nothing was as fulfilling anymore and I felt like I would do anything to hear the soothing voice of my beloved

before you download isand serves more as a ground of improv Youll see serious stuffgoofy stuffintense actionand depending on who plays SCPs horrifiedand somehow survives getting enough lead pumped into him to respark ww12 restart the cold war by hiding in the intercom True Story this is known as the guy thats on everyones KILL list for the next 10 rounds because he held the round up for  hours Seriouslyif you behave like this in any wayDONT play this You will more than likely get pwnd more than you could ever hope to make up for This is a gamenot the Olympicsbut I think Ill give it a shotor SCIENTIST you are in the class that has a casualty rate of 9but dont worryfind SCP914upgrade said cardescape the bottom levelif you see men in green before thiscongrats youll escape in under a minute if you see men in bluein short youll either be arrestedor shot the latter most likelyupgrade your assigned cardescape bottom level if you see men in blueyou liveif they are greenyou are boned as they will never take prisonersexterminate all the men in blueand maybe the white coats too you dont need to kill anything else though you CANand murder EVERYTHING ELSE Orange men optionalyou can arrest thembut you need to stay with themand where DclassScientist go to escape even though most of them will never make it therebecause Chaos Insurgencyand the Mobile Task Force spawn up here you will know that chaos is spawning if you see a vehicle drive into Gate Ayoull know the Mobile Task Force is about to spawn when you see a Helicopter land at Gate Balso the reason why 99 of both Chaosand the MTF never show up to rescue those they are supposed to rescueas they are too busy fighting over who gets to use the intercomand sometimes erupts into a bloody skirmish even among members of your own teamthe Elevators to Gate AB are also hereNote NEVER take the first elevator down to entrancethis is how you avoid the other noobs who throw grenades in elevator SCPSecret Lab Tradition at this point to throw a grenade in the elevator while your whole teams in it at least ONCEafter awhile you will be able to identify which SCP you are dealing with by the sound of their foostepsand adjust your courseapproach promptly Keep in mind that often times this place is RIDDLED with Tesla Gatesbut they are almost impossible to die from unless there is an SCP09check the cameras to see if they light up blue firstif so dont cross when the light goes outthen cross at your own descretionso ill add this seeing how you like attention to detailafter the 15 minute markall doors will closeand a corrosive gas will be pumped via the air filtration systemkilling Players instantlyand giving the SCPs time to reflect on their obviousfoolish mistep you will hear the Games announcer nonplayer warn you in 5 minute intervalseveryone is forced to blink in three seconds intervals when someone playing this cahracter is in the area so you can still SLOWLY dawdle towards your targetyou can snap their necksthis one is the most hated as he makes you a zombie if you camp the elevators as this SCPsome players will try to make you suffer for doing this I wont say how as these players who do this genually deserve itif you just leave the players dead at the elevatorsjust screenshot the pile of bodies before the reserves still stuck on the surface start sending down active grenades He also apparently heals himself overtimeso dont be the guy who uses that to hold the game up for  hoursor 049 camped your elevatorand now you are one of his zombies Most zombies tend to bump themselves off so you dont REALLY need to worry about them as a human characterunless there is a rule against that some servers do in which case most will PRETEND to chargeand Attack you This is mostly a players way on conveying Up yours to some owners for this rule Its not breaking itbut not directly following it either You will most likely NEVER kill anything as a zombie as its mostly seen as the spectator rolebut you can move freelyand ATTACK Enemy hitregister for this class is godawfulborderline uselessso your attacks are garaunteed to missunless the target for whatever reason is standing perfectly still thus why most people hate this classand hate 049 for reviving themor guy thats in it for the laughs You can tell this by how they talk over the various speakers throughout the facilitycant use the intercom though He can open all doorsand activate everything except the warheadand the intercomand almost become a laughing stock in of themselves for this a COMPETENT tryhard 09 will corner you in a small roomand let the other SCPs finish you offalso very predictablebut not laughable Would be scary if they would avoid using the speakers as once the Human characters Players hear your voiceit immediately removes 0 of the overall fear factor its not scary when you know whos behind the maskchat with the other playersand if they are feeling especially niceeven open doors for youthen you go to LUDICROUS SPEED for 15 seconds before slowing back down the speed of an infant trying to learn how to stand upright you can tell when hes near as youll hear echoes of cryingsobbingor the most annoying Depends He has the most terrifying Modeltakes reduced damageEnemy HitRegister is also bad for this SCPbut its not as badhumiliating as 0492 there is a reason It balances out 106s ability to walk through doorsand teleport If you know how to jump horny little bunnyrabbit lookin for some sugaryou can evade this guy 45 of the timeyou may feel your heart skip a beat when doing this thoughif he touched a human playersaid human will have to escape the pocket dimensionand talks Thats it  Just slow walk to a corner avoid pressing against himnobody knows whats going on and thats half the funIts creepy if you make it creepybut the majority of the timeits a hilariously chaotic mess Play with friends for extra funA DClass got stuck in an elevator and the entire server cooperated to get him out 1010 Faith in humanity restoredProsMy experiences with this gamethis SCP also chopped my hands offwith great graphics and plot this is not your gameif you wish to have fun and meet tons of fun strangers while also getting a thrill from the SCPthis is for youI convinced scp1 to spare me because I had a peanut allergy
