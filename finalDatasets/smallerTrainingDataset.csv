0,"This game ruined my life. I am not hating or anything. I was from Dota 1 for like 3-4 years before Dota  was released and it didn't caught my attention to adapt the new theme of it.an awesome game. I really should have thought about spending money on a free game but to hell with it I say. Mechanics are well designedwhat makes a hero OP is the player behind it and the team that surrounds it. This is a team game peopleso team work is a must (unless you are solo queuingthen you have to carry your garbage of a team but it can be the other way around). Monster gamers are real.you can only be good at something if you focus on itlearn from mistakesbe aware of your surroundingstrust your instinctuse common sensetrusting on your team to always have your backbelieving in your capabilitiesalways try to be better than you were yesterdayand that..not just friends but complete strangers too. Dota  is a game that will never be forgotten.I recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience painsufferingand torment because at the endyou will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get better.it's just a game...... YAWA![h1]""You learn how to learnhow to lose and most importantly you learn about you.""[/h1]Dota is something elsesomething i have never experienced even when i was addicted to a mmorpg when i was 9-13. You learn how to learnhow to improvehow to win and how to lose. The most important thing dota teached me was how emotions impact your performanceand that  saying ""nothing"" is sometimes the best thing to do. In real life no one really teaches you stuff like that since people are kind of used to dealing with emotional assholes.knowing myselfim really unsure of how much my life wouldve been different if i never started dota. I asume i wouldve been a bit further regarding social contacts but career/school-wise i highly doubt  that it wouldve made a big difference. You gotta  be realistic when thinking about stuff like this. Im not a very social guy. I dont like to put work into stuff i dont care about. The thoughts ""lets learn music""  or ""lets study"" wouldnt have EVER crossed my mind when i was 15. Im pretty sure if i wouldnt have started with dota i wouldve just been gooning around the city and abuse drugssince thats a lot of fun to me. Back then i actually never even thought about working on something to improvethat whole dimension of ""improving"" wasnt even there for me. I just went to school got home and did fun stuff sometimes. Thats it. No goals. No aspirationnothing. Dota changed that.unlike studying or learning an instrument. Just think about what kind of game dota  is that spending 1000s of hours is something you do with pleasure. It's kind of insane thinking about it. Once i started studying more for  school again i realized how much fucking time 100 hours is. I garantue you that you  will be a top student if youd put 0 hours a week into studying outside of school. But the big difference is that dota is just so much more fun and REWARDING.not great)).so i needed something to doEATS ALL YOUR TIMEYOU WILL HAVE FUN(if you are competetive)This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers.Do you have depression? Do you have anxiety? Do you get sporadic panic attacks throughout the day? Are you a racistxenophobe who knows how to curse in 1 different languages? Do you and your friends fight all the time? Are you addicted to nicotine? Fear not. This game will give you all the above.Pros:If you want to have a great life with jobsmoneysgirletcdon't play this game.It's like an unhealthy one-way relationship. Likeyou have invested so much time and energy to making things workbut somehow you're never good enough and it is always your fault. You still love them though...its kI often feel the desire to play Dota Causes anxiety problemslow self esteemTourette's syndromemood swingsBipolar disorderbreakdown of relationshipsraging erectionsracism.

1,"I don't think I've ever taken the time to review a game in the 11+ years I've had Steam  However New World's current direction has compelled me to let future potential buyers know what they're getting intopeople  I'm old enough that many of the people playing this game could be a child of mine  My first MMO was Ultima Online (Pre-Tram) and I've played every major (and most non-major) MMOs since then  I love the genreeven if I don't always enjoy every game that releases in the MMO realmif judged by their actions aloneare clueless about balance and quality of user-experience in an MMO  Either that or they are making very purposeful decisions that set up future ""boost"" items in their cash shop  I really don't know which is the casebut recent changes have made it an even more difficult processbut the smaller servers are going to have problemsbut they nerf it every patch  They do this because those loudinfluential voices complain about healing  The Devs are not done nerfing healing--more will come because even after drastically reducing healing in the last patch (and the 3-4 before it)the same voices are still complaining  Add in the lack of raid frames or even group member hotkeys and healing become a frustratingunfun experiencemagesbow)  Outside the brief period when Hatchet was OP due to a bugthe Meta of Gaxe/WH hasn't changedI'm surebut it is undeniably frustratingI am unable to recommend this game to new players due to the direction we can all see the Devs taking New World  They nerf based on the desire of the vocal minoritythey make end game harder to drag out the watermarking experience and they seem to create 2 problems every time they fix oneI called out some dude selling overpriced bags in global chat and started telling people how to find better prices in trade post by viewing all territory prices in top right of trade post menu and his entire company/guild said they were mass reporting me and I got a 24 hour automated ban for abusive behaviorIt feels a bit weird that there are taxes in an MMO created by AmazonIf numbers going up makes your brain make the chemicalyou will enjoy this game a lotStill can't find Lumbridge but some friendly players gave directions to VarrockI haven't reached level 60 yet (I'm closeat 54)but I'm already feeling a bit burned out thanks to a myriad of weird design choices on AGS' part For startersthere's no ingame restriction so that a faction can't control 90% of the landthus disabling 90% of the endgame content (faction warfare)my own faction owns all but two citiesand this is mostly due to a big clan from another game just showing up in numbers and creating like 8 clans that just steamroll everything End result? You can't play in a war if you aren't from one of their companiesyou can't really do large scale PvP because almost no one from other factions bothers to go outside with PvP onand you can't even play the PvE invasionsbecause the ruling clan will abuse the kick mechanic to select 50 players instead of the 10 they should be selectingthere's a lot of other stuff going on that is slowly eroding my patience Imagine you go into a dungeon with your friendsfight all the way to the endthen one of your party dies when the final boss is at 5% HP Guess what you have to do if you want everyone to be able to complete their dungeon quest/get loot? Yeahyou need to force a wipe because the game won't let that other player get their stuff or complete their missions Who thought that was a good idea?then while you are visiting another area which has extreme taxesthat item sells Guess what? You'll get charged the extreme taxeseven if the item was actually sold on the lower taxes area Why?

Nothing Where are all the casuals that they appealed to? Gone Was it worth it? I don't knowlook at the server population chartswhere you expect to get that juicy and valuable rare (ressembles a little to gambling and opening chests where you waste money maybe? Except here you waste timewhich obviously is the same)farming the same 2 bosses for decadesand playing laggy wars and some stupid unskilled game mode called Outpost Rushwhich is also lagged haha Wellwhat about dungeons you say? We have dungeonsexcept the chests were bugged and they dropped literally trashit took them 2 months to fix this (not to mention that dungeons werefor some reasonlagged for two weeks after releasemaking them unplayable) The only decent late game stuff you could do was ""Expeditions""which are like open dungeons with chests that actually worked as intendedexcept that todaywith the latest patchthey decided to NERF the loot drop from said chestsand buff the mobs from expeditions by multiplying their HPjust so you have to grind more and waste more time :)there are no incentives at all The most fun I had was when I was lvl 10 to 30 and played flagged You get rewards by winning duels in the open worldbut these are only meaningless amounts of XP that will decrement in time Once you get to max lvlthere is no incentive to continue playing flagged and dueling other playerssince you only get 200 factions tokensa very unefficient way of farming said currency Not to mentionthat if you happen to find a player that is also flagged in the open worldit would probably be a healera disgusting class that is unkillable and has no skill/whatsoever that counters it If you are looking for a PVP gameexpect to play instantiated and safe PVP in the comfort zonessuch as Outpost Rushor wars for terrysanother unskilled and boring mode It is saidthoughthat the game will have arenas (2vs25vs5and such)but will see At this pacethey will rush it and screw things upagainthere is something that needs to be clarified for new players that it is very unfair If you are oneconsider that: the game has gone through two MAJOR DUPING PROBLEMSwhere dupers were left unpunished or were poorly punished (1 week bans) The second onethat the game uses a watermark systemwhere you grind killing mobs/opening chestsso your consequent drops are of a higher gear score (more statsperk valuesdef/atk) Players that have abused the now fixed exploits (such as tentacle farm) are already maxed out in this watermark systemand alsoleft unpunished Not to mentionthat the drops from bosses that were grinded for watermark increaseand also chestsnow drop way less items The third onealso introduced with todays patchthat the great devs decided to increase the required XP needed to lvl up craftsso you will have to grind 20 times more than mefor exampleonly better graphics at the expense of perfomance A complete buggy shitshow Incompetent designers and devs Game needed at least 1-2 years of BETA before release It has pronouns in bio KEKthe devs decided to lower the taxes by 90%which is goodand decided to give a stimulus check to those who had house taxes to pay I don't know what kind of weird specimens are coding in AGSsince after the hotfixplayers in EU logged in with extra gold (said amount is between 50k-200k btwso consider the impact that would have in the already fucked up economy) Because this problem happened only in Europespeculations are that there was a typo in the expression of moneysince EU uses """" and America a """"for separating thousands No proof of thisbut have no doubts that this is the case Ending upindividual rollbacks are plannedbut the issue is that players already made transactions with other players that are not going through said rollbackSo far it's a decent game Has a few boring momentsthe story is mehbut I like the crafting system and combat When you get people together and go do pvp stuff it's really fun My main gripe is the Dbags who got to level 23+ and run around low level zones killing the weaker players trying to do pvp missions If you're lvl 25why not go fight players in that area? It acts as a block to people from accessing the main draw of the game If you get killed doing pvp missionsthey auto fail and that kinda blows All in all it's like a 7/10 so farI cut trees[h1]YOU STILL THINK THE GAME IS GOOD NOW ? WITH ALL THE GOLD DUPING!!! WHERE ARE ALL THE HATER ?

But alasyou make an idiotic mistake You end as #2that moment will haunt you foreveryou'll feel rageanger and above all serenity when you die because you know that the game is overuntil you start the next oneThis game is like dating an alcoholic They're a lot of fun to be aroundand you legitimately like them But they have serious problems that ruin the whole relationship You keep thinking they'll changebut they never will Instead they'll just try to sell you an Event Pass to see parts of their bodyAfter almost 1000 hours of playingit's time for me to voice my thoughts I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steamand I've been there through the goodthe bad and the ugly Over two years in and the game runs like it should The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style Howeverwith the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackersthey review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers I've seen speed hacksaim botsno recoilyou name it It's honestly ruined the game when you can't win because a hacker will sneak around and ambush you When hackers are gone for good i'll play PUBG all day long and change my review As it isthe game is dead to me right nowreworked Sanhok Map is improved a lot Hackers still problem Salty comments spreading like wildfire Send help2100 hours ingamePubgCorp:we can't ban cheaterswe can't let you choose the map anymorewe can't improve AI for bots even though they are the only players in some matcheswe can't fix any lags problem / FPS stuttering / freezing or crashing issueswe can't do whatever you likeThis game was killed by greedy and incompetent developers They have made A LOT of money out of usbut they still refused to fix their gamethey kept releasing broken updates while turning a blind eye on actual problems such as rampant cheatingit's still not as optimized as a game this big should be They are sueing Epic Games because they are seeing a dip into their profits and they are too self absorbed to realize their own incompetence is turning players awaynot a better competitorthey don't care about fixing what they already have nowthey don't care about youAfter 2 years and 2200 hours of gameplayI was Permanently Banned from PUBG without any reasoning provided I have purchased every Event Passand even purchased in-game cosmeticsmaking the account worth a great deal to me in many waysand I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressiveas I am not a good player) I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issuesglitches and bugs from updatesaimbottersetc) But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurdbut in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the gameone of which was *apparently* violated It was not a personal responseas the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Banhe/she just copied and pasted an automated responseBought this game in the morningi told myself I'd play one moreafter 10 hours I realised that the sun went down xD3 years and 3500 hours of gameplay and this game is still a jokeglitchesbugsFPS dropsdesyncyou name it!I can live with all of the abovePecadoBoot CampPodvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire cityonly to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 200m mid-game and ruin it for the entire teamit is a ""temporary ban""  What do you mean ""temporary""?

I can't Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money I can let it slide for Apexand Warzone Why? Those games are free This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind This season pass crap is the new loot boxes Vote with your wallet peoplesay no to this crapover a yearfor this game to fix itself PUBG provides a grittyrealisticpulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate Nothing feels quite like PUBG But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplaythere is too much garbage that comes with this game The hackers in every matchthe inexcusable bugsthe practically non-existent content updates I'm about done I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from eventsto temporary game modesand hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market The god awful soldier cratesand then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfithalf of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace Surethey finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated Why do free games have a better bug-freehacker-freefunctioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customizationlootand progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were addedfixedand reworked But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated I cannotin good consciencerecommend this game to anybodyGame is OK Used to be fun until everyone started using cheats Wish Bluehole would FIX their ani-cheat agentI hate to say this and it's sad to see - but the state of the game now is awful Yes it plays quite well and visually looks better than ever - but it's really lost that PUBG magic and feel Empty feeling lobbies with bots filling numbersa new menu / system every time I log on it feels likeand so many micro transactions Everything just feels cluttered and complicated as soon as you log on with a very messy UIand I'm pretty sure Barney the dinosaur ran past me at one point It's like it's suddenly lost it's own identity and copied Fortnite?!stealing other games recipes and jumbling it up into one messThis game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potentialpubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal gameliterally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significantits suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community Cheatersnot refining core gameplayadding features noone wants or asks forthe most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this gameand really its a shame because under all this bullshit is some of the best gun play of any fps on the marketas someone who has over 2k hours in itthere is great potential here The real defining problemand it is the most significant problemis ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers They have never listened to their communityever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removedadding new mechanics to ensure safer rotationsa focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawnsmost of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patchyet the devs just double down on new maps$500 skinsand patches that always break the gamebecause that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of shitAfter nearly 3000 hours of playing timeim sorry to reportthat this game development is going into the completly wrong directionand the player base wont get splitwhile loosing your loyal playersbut banning players because of the numbers of reports the player gets -  for me this results in almost consistent bans every two weeks because of my winratewhich is around 25% of all the games i play - makes a lot of funif you look forward to play some games and then you are banned - again and againweapon control is brilliantbut the way how PUBG is developing the game is just blatant and carelessyou messed up BIG TIMEWellmy first review on Steam goes to PUBG After 1650 hrs of playing I loved this game and I hated this gamebut since 2017 was playing continuously Cursing after getting killedscreaming after winninga lot of joyexcitementfrustration This is PUBG Sorry - it was PUBG After patch 72 this game is not for me anymore I am not pro playerI am just a guy who liked to play few matches in PUBG after hard day and enjoy everything I described above Why I am forced now to choose between play with mindless bots or pro squadmates? I enjoyed this game mostly solo or with my friend as duo Playing this game nowI feel nothing I feel boreddisappointed Even after chicken dinnerseriously I feel like I reached to 8th season of Game of Thrones I'm afraid this is the last time I uninstall this game All I have to do now is press F to pay respect the oldgood PUBG I will miss you my friendthanks for everythingPatch 72 released 5/20/20 has effectively KILLED this game  A short sighted money grab by the devs has conspired to inject loads of BOTS into virtually all BR game types (ranked squads being the exception)  With this movethe very core of what made PUBG's gameplay special has now been eviscerated  Getting a kill or a win used to be difficult and in turn rewarding  Now you can hop into a vehicle and proceed to run down enemy AI with impunity  They've also made terrible changes to the circleall but eliminating any intermission between circlesmaking it a running match from start to end  I've always felt that the dev team had a certain amount of contempt for it's player basebut this move confirms my suspicions   As of todaythe NA player base has dwindled down to 230K avg concurrent users  Expect that number to drop by at least  50% within the coming months  It's sad for me because this was my favorite game I can now safely attest that this game is in it's death rattle  Save your money and look for the next best thing comingGIVE US BACK DAMN OPTION TO CHOOSE MAPS  Still not giving u positive review before u give us back map selection fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu 200hrs later same opinion i just have to add GIVE US THE DUO OPTION FOR NEW MAPS AND RANKED ARE U DUMB OR JUST STUPID ? Why am i forced to play with 2 random people when i just want to have a nice couple of hrs of playtime with my buddy after work ? This is BSImagine a restaurant that has five dishes to choose from These are called ErangelMiramarSanhokVikendi and Karakinsome taste like a smoothie made from toothpaste and fishthe restaurant decides you can't order any longer The dish you will get is [u]random[/u]than the dish you like Obviously no real restaurant operates like thisthey would go broke in a week Yet the creators of Player Unknowns Battlegrounds think this is a wise strategic decisionI've encountered this game just like 999% of it's player-base didby watching Twitch streams and youtube videosI managed to talk few of my friends into playing itwe've spent hundreds of hours on ita game which brought it's developers millions (if not 10 digit numbers)and as any sane personyou'd expect that it will be poured into further development and fixesright?and then proceed to blow it up and cave it in They had everythingmassive FREE ADVERTISEMENT (NOTE: FREE > NOT REQUIRED TO PAY FOR) in a form of Twitch streamers and YouTube content creatorsinsane ACTIVE player-basea product that's close to being 10 ready Everythingthey got everything And what do they do?:and instead of actually WORKING on itwhat do they do? More platformsthey completely ignored that fact and started working on more crates and more in-game purchasesand considering I'm actually rating a game here and not it's thirsty developerI'll focus on it now:there are still PLENTY of non-conventional cheaters such as VPN abusers (lifting ping on purpose to abuse the poor netcode and hit detection) and Macro users (Auto-aim/Recoil control) Even though the numbers have droppedthis is still heavily affecting the game and user experiencegetting stuck in thin air while landing resulting in getting killedreloading sometimes doesn't reload your weapon at all resulting in getting killed)constant stuttering60%+ fail rate of reconnecting to the game in case of a disconnectbut ironically has least contentleast quality looting areaa MASSIVE LACK of vehicles considering the proportions of the map (mostly resulting in you playing a running simulator for about 20 minutes and ending up getting killed by someone who had luck with the initial safe zone) Even though the original map is betterthey still need to prevent bridge camping which makes the game impossible if you had bad luck with initial looting and safe zonemy character no longer stutters while runningproving my point this was indeed caused by the gameand not by my PC or internet connectionthere are way moreif you haven't already bought this game: DO NOT Save your money There are better alternatives if you're just taking up a new gameand they're even free to play They don't have some of the mechanics PUBG hasand that's a shamebut at least they're optimized Keep in mind that this game requires over the average PC to even be able to start the gamelet alone play it properlythere's still time to fix it"

1,"With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher)let me give this perspective/advice for new playersspecifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Lightwith a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:but when it doesit [b]really[/b] shines.the handling feels really goodand enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.this is considerably less content than it used to be/I would like]this should be easier than ever for most activities. That saida huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (""Darkness Zones"" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revivesso solo players have a distinct disadvantage there).dungeons (currently only The Shattered ThronePit of Heresyand Prophecy) and raids (""Last Wish"" from Forsaken""Garden of Salvation"" from Shadowkeepand ""The Deep Stone Crypt"" from Beyond Light) are best experienced with a teamso dont shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discordofficial appor any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experienceleveland gear. Tis only polite).I really enjoy Gambit (PvPvEreminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right)jump into the occasional Strike (PvEmatchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions)and have no interest in Crucible (PvPits fine I guessbut Ive never liked PvP thats dependentat least in parton personal progression)or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.lost sectorspatrol locationsor quest chains.and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (""What are random rolls?

The fact that a representative chunk of this game is now free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet (unless youre crazy like me). Any other questions about this game as a product (""What is weapon sunsetting? Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?"") should absolutely be researched elsewhere. [Especially now that infusion caps AKA sunsetting have been announced as being effectively rolled backwhich no longer makes older content irrelevant in newer endgame activities. They also announced that the level cap increase season after season will be reduced by a significant margincutting down on the seasonal grind considerably.

1,">plays survivorDo you hate yourself? Buy this game. Youll learn to hate everyone else so much more.[h1] While I generally love this gameI have a few warnings to those who are interested in buying it. [/h1]what are they doingwhat should you be doing?.not teaching.theres some pretty nifty things.... [/h1]which are gained through leveling ones account up.and potentially has perks from DLC characters available.some use Discord instead.as well as crouching.most people who play survivor want full SWF crews.charactersperks.including goofing off.Id recommend. Probably about a 8.5/10. Have not pooped my pants due to this game but have come close a time or two. ThanksGhost Face.[/h1]which changes how survivors play. Ex: Zombies being added in the R.E. chapter (in Player Test Build at the time of this update).unlocked through game-playor redeemed via codes released by BHVR.theres an event to find Gnome Chompski once the exit gates are powered.which can be both good and bad. Gens feel closer together but that also applies to hooks.lore (The Archives)and various forms of in-game currency.so I can only assume that means killer queue times are better in the afternoon/evening.but its better than it used to be.but also toxicityin higher ranks.the higher ranks tend to be very serious...self... Its just a game...the hit boxes need some improvement. Lagframe-perfect timingand other aspects all influence whether the hatchet hits your face or clips through your face.but if a Huntress nails me across the mapIm impressed with the shot and outraged on the killers behalf if it doesnt register.solid colorthen fade-out screen aura might be a good option for this? It would preserve visual information without giving an unfair advantage to players.players with disabilities just wanna grind for bloodpoints and cry  like everyone else. If your primary concern is giving players an unfair advantage please remember that accessibility options compensate for a set-back so that people with disabilities have an even playing field.but the hit box issues can definitely make this game feel like a 2/10.[/h1]if they ever stumble their way into this review:Out of all the reviews I wroteThis one is probably the most serious one I wrote.You dont wanna talk to them because theyre all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blahits rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this game.The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave. After seeing that they didnt make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG. So I give this game a 8/10.I actually had to take my time to write this because I didnt wanna swear in it so you didnt see nothing but censor hearts that steam likes to do. So if you actually read this let me know by leaving a comment so I can be like someone read this peice of crap review yay!Disclaimer: I survivor main.not for competitionso the DBD community doesnt really get to me. If I get a bad killer that face campsoh well. I die and move on to the next game. If I get a good killer who finds me immediatelyhooks me (bc I cant juke whoops)and then patrol camps (which Im 100% OK with)then no biggie. Next game please~it takes away from the fun of the game in my opinion.Ive also been called names by survivors who tell me to get gud. Older players ruin it for newer players or players who dont put in 1000s of hours. Just relax and have fun with the game! So what if you dont pip up - there is always the next game :)this game is crazy fun. Dont let the saltiness of the community keep you from buying the game. Grab ithave fun with itand ignore anyone who might give you a hard time ;) And dont fixate too much on the ranking process unless youre absurdly highly competitive for some reason (also fine - just try not to let it push you into spouts of anger!)and even thenrecognize that there are jerks who play this gamelike any other gameand have fun while you compete!I log on play a match get pissed log offrepeat this processthen hate my lifeProbably about half of my play time is dedicated to queuing for a matchDo you hate yourself? Buy this game. Youll learn to hate everyone else so much more...very difficult to determine if youre having fun or not.Playing as survivor: ""killers are too OP""its like a love hate relationshipI hate playing killer and dealing with the toxic communityThis game is pretty fun but like in the worst possible way. I dont know.ÐÐµ Ñ€ÐµÐºÐ¾Ð¼ÐµÐ½Ð´ÑƒÑŽIm a Grandma whose son is a streamer on here.  After watching him and his friends and community for the last few months I decided to try the game.  Its actually pretty fun!   Ive just played 5 games so farso I have a lot to learn but Im hanging in there.  haha.I played DBD about 1030 hours. But one daymy account was initialized with an error message. All the killers and survivorss level became Level 1. And all items and perks are disappeared. I submitted a ticket to the DBD team about this matter with Steam ID64Cloud IDLeaderboard recordsevidence photos. But they refused to compensate mesaying they couldnt find anything strange in their logs. Ratherthey said that if you keep providing false informationyoull be punished strongly. Thenthey closed the agenda obstinately. I really loved this gamebut now I feel betrayed. I would never recommend it. There are so many bugs in this game and no compensation for the victim. Even the crew doesnt have basic manners. Dont buy this game. Dont waste your money and life.20209:40 ESTI will be closing this ticket.I said ""If you dont believe the informationI could give you my Steam ID and passwordso if you wanttell me"".

Sadly Ive come to find that PC players are just as ignored as console when it comes to BHVR.years agoCote had described the game as ""no longer theirsit now belonged to the community"" which at the time I thought was beautiful. Years laterhoweverafter new hires like Ethanthe game has belittledignoredand straight up asked veterans to leave.and Mid Chapter 4.5 that completely ignore the complaints of the community.I finally had enough that I was going to submit individual bug tickets to them for every bug theyve been neglectingonly to find out theyve updated their website to hide bug tickets at the very bottom and shrunk the box to a 5th of the previous sizewhile having added tons of pictures and ads for the gameand top centering a small FAQ style technical support for things already fixed.herds morons like sheep into defending their actively bad decisions by posting occasional memesand milks the game and its players by working minimally and at their own whim while we beg and plead for them to just acknowledge they heard what we have to say. Im ashamed Ive spent so many years of my life believing in and supporting a game that left me behind years ago without me noticing.""Nothing is meant to be fairand apparently by design"" - Mathieu Cote (Game director On Dead by Daylight)the developers acknowledged it during one of their interviews. You will be annoyed by everything. By one of the most toxic communitiesby poor balance decisionscountless bugs. Despite bringing the feeling of satisfaction sometimesyour mental state overall will be worse by the end of most play sessions. You wont play this game because you like ityou will play it because youre addicted to the constant feeling of surpassing the irritation. And the worst part is that you will feel rewarded because of the fact that you outplayed players who are there to mock you and verbally abuse you by the end of a game. Its not healthy no matter how you look at it. Even if you have ""thick skin""its simply unenjoyable to waste your time on such people when you think about it.you need to put 100 hours for each character. And there are so many of themit may take 1000 hours to gain them all for free.if the upcoming changes are disliked by the communitythey will be rolled anyways since what can people dofind another Dead By Daylight? Money were put into creation of the things players didnt likeget it or leave. Ohwaityou wont.currently the game has a few strong perks that the community takes and the other perks are not being used at all unless a player wants to feel less powerful for some reason. And the killers often feel dull as well. Instead of working on the previous perks and killers the developers prefer to make new perks and killers for the sake of pumping up money.wellstop spreading negativity. This creates a false sense of positivity when the community is furious at BHVR at the moment.do not support this mess. It looks fun on the outside but its a mess.Before i played Dead by Daylighti had a small wee-weeno friendsno girlfrienddepressionand absolutely no life. These things havent changedbut the game is pretty good.good game if u dont like urself"
1,"So I started playing 'Rust' at 4pm yesterdaya bear ate me Then I watched two other players club each other to death with large stoneswhile completely nakedpenises (penii?) dangling in the wind Having managed to slay a small pigI fashioned some clothes to cover my genitalsthen went exploringalso a shirt and a pair of boots Went about fashioning a small shelter out of some random crap laying around so I wouldn't have to sleep outdoors I could have chosen from one of the manymanyramshackle structures dotting the landscape But those may or may not belong to/contain other players Who may or may not be armed or clothed I just wanted to peacefully live aloneso I stuck to the wildernessasking what to do to fix my broken legsI didn't understand the game and I needed help A naked man came overtyped '??? i help' in response to my pleasthen bashed my head in with a rock and presumably looted my corpsebut didnt have time to cook so I ate raw meat again Nope Instead of just starving to deathI vomitedthen starved to deathI've decided to sleep in a small shack I made myself in the mountains Don't dare risk making a firesomeone might see it at night and kill me for the tin of baked beans I got off a zombie I found wandering around a town that gave me radiation poisoning Oh yeahI'll probably die slowly because of the radiationbut thats a problem for later-meI can probably safely say I'm enjoying this gameI used to have a simple review for this gametitled ""Best Game""and I start to sell off my skin inventoryI feel it necessary to give this game what it has given to me over these past few yearsthere's plenty of survival games out there But this game stands apart from the rest in ways I can't explain The amount of friends I've madeenemies I've madebases I've madebases I've destroyed The amount of times I've been in massive PVP situationsdefended my base from a raidwoken up to be offlinedrebuilt The feeling of having AK less than an hour into wipe on vanillaof ""dancing with zergs"" as a soloor being part of a massive clan with friends The stories I've created The stories WE createdyour teammatesand your enemies make day in and day out as you work together or compete to not only survivebut thriveand it's the first game I ever truly got hooked on I'm sure one daymaybe even only a month or two from nowI'll be sucked right back in I love rust for the difficultyfor the challengefor the buildingfor the adrenaline pumping PVP I've never experienced in any other gameand it doesn't give second chances But as you play more and moreand gain experiencelearn the game's unique PVP and your way around the monuments You'll find yourself gradually getting better and better Whether it be buildinglike it was for meor PVPor even roleplayingyou'll find your place in this worldLove this gamelost my gfmy jobmy dignity but at least i have my rockThis game ruined my life I don't know why I ever got into it I wish i never did it ruined my grades it ruined my sleep schedule it ruined me as a person and I want to kill myself now 10/10 game will keep playingI will be playing for weeks until I run out of food in my fridge and I die of playing RustI will be confiscating all of his Rust skins as this was written in has last willBefore i played Rusti had a small wee-weeno friendsno girlfrienddepressionand absolutely no life These things haven't changedbut the game is pretty good95/10got shotsaw it explodegot shotgot shotgot shot when i turned around95/10got shotsaw it explodegot shotgot shotgot shot when i turned around1 Watch some YouTube videosAfter around an hour and a half of bad spawnsscarce resourcesand short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the mapI ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust I had initially spotted him pretty far awaybut I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other andupon the realization that neither of us were hostilewe both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust) I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metaland he gave me some food as a sign of good faith After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavengingwe had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine bouldersand a lot of them I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bulletsthough I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow I had been running with my hatchet outso I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his directionattempting to scare him away When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined Just as we were moving on to the next boulderI heard the gunfire start I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friendand before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the campas that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking I typed into the chatthanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines He simply wrote ""Sorry guys :D"" This is the single problem that I have with games like this Why does it have to be ""shoot-on-sight?"" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area But of coursehe comes aroundsees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the gameand decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets Thento add even more of an insulthe adds an apology at the endas if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpectinghalf-nakedunprepared playersthoughI do see a lot of potential in this gameand the good in the community does shine through every once in a while I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience6 men yelled racial slurs at me while i tried to break a rock 10/10 would play againDo you have a wife and kids? Do you go to school? Do you have a life? Do you have anything to do outside of your pc? If you answered yes to any of these questionsthis is not the game for youBefore buying Rustask yourself the following questionsregardless of group size?do not buy this gamefull-timetoxic job then this game is for you! For the low price of only $40 you too can be employed>see a guyThe key to enjoying RUST is simple Find the right server If you like desperately trying to avoid getting ghosted by groups of geared player-killers while clawing your way into position as top dogthere's a server for that If you like building a great base and only fighting other players in specific areasthere's a server for that If you like fighting off zombies while never having to deal with getting raided or offlinedthere's a server for that The graphics are intense and visceralyet also beautifulwhile the crafting and building are pretty intuitive once you get used to the system For your first run I would suggest a specifically newb friendly server until you get used to thingsotherwise it will just be lots of dying and rage quitting and you will miss an excellent survival shooterDo you like putting in hours of work just to be offline raided by a group of 15? Do you like being murdered by someone with an assault rifle while you're butt naked with nothing but a rock? Do you like seeing toxic children arguing in chat 24 hours of the day? WELLthis is the game for youbut you'll have fun developing the worst trust issues of your life 10/10Most toxic game i have playedI love this gameI built a house around a guys house and made him my prisonerI fed him cans of tuna and cooked chicken when it was availableand some times I would drop in spare logs of wood(when they were available) The best part he talks to mekeeps telling me his clans going to raid my structure and save him I simply respond with â€ It puts the lotion on its skinor it gets the hose againâ€ and by hose I mean I dump charcoal on himI think my pet may need to eatYou have to play this game 24/7so get ready to lose everything in your lifeexcept for the virginitySo before i begin with this review : Yeah we all know Rust is a laggy piece of sh*t sometimesso i won`t discuss this herewho listen to the communityand the community has almost full access to moddingbut that is not a main problem imobut that is life! Not everyone you meet will be nice or help you!but if you are stubborn enough you will learn how to do it / manage itI murdered 30 people using a chainsaw and survived solely by eating my victims meat and stealing their fat to make fuel for my chainsaw I also collected their skulls"
1,"I've been playing Path of Exile since 2011 closed beta and it's remarkable how far the game has come purely from crowd funding  The passion of the userbase is equally matched by it's developers  They've shown throughout the years to constantly improve and tweak the game with regularly scheduled content additions  I still feel I don't know everything there is to know about this gameand that isn't changing any time soon  Path of Exile is an incredibly complex and rewarding game that is definitely worth your timethe other large appeal of this game is the end-game  Most ARPGs fail to offer incentive to continue to play your character after you've exhausted the content  Usually this just comes in the form of a easily attainable level cap or grinding the same final zone of the game at length  Insteadin POE you are given item drop instancesas described by the developers:magicrare or unique with higher rarity Maps yielding more items Using a Map item opens six portals to the areawhich can each only be used once Like most other items in Path of ExileMaps have mods that change their risks and rewards Map mods can affect the size or complexity of the levelmonster packsmonster properties or even alter characters while in the level Players can modify Maps themselves using their currency items For exampleyou can use an Orb of Transmutation to turn a normal Map into a magic Mapor use an Orb of Alteration to reroll its mods""with room for countless variation in modifiers letting you push the limits of your character  Not all characters are equal  You will find that some characters that excell in early progression have difficulty in the end-game and visa versa  Each character I've made has informed the next which is critical in a game that rewards experience and skillPOE offers alternative ARPG experiences in the form of daily race events which are time based leveling with unique modifiers that you won't see in the real game like 'Turbo Mode'  Moreover some of these races have entirely unique content like Descent: Champions or Endless Ledge which offer players the ability to win special art reskins of legendary items for the leagues of their choiceThis game is not very friendly to casual playersbeginners will have a relatively hard time grasping the game's multiple mechanics that have never been in an ARPG previously However those who put in the time to learn the game's basics will be rewarded with a tremendously addictive game with nearly infinite ways to play There are many reviews here explaining what the game's features arebut on mine I would like to focus on what a newbie can expect when first playing I recommend reading this after having read one of the other reviewsthat will do a better overview of what the actual game features aresuch as going full evasion/energy shield gear (without proper understanding of how ES works)or building a full glass cannon characterwhich is not a good idea (even in a non-hardcore league)and building your character as you go is rarely a good idea This is something that players learn over timeand meanwhile a good way to decide what to play is to find a fun skill in-gameand then look up a build for it on the forums (link provided below) Remember that almost anything can work in this gamewith proper planningin it's placecurrency items Currency items are the items that are used for buying and selling in PoEbut they have an added value in the effects that they can have when used on items For example: An orb of alchemy can turn a white item (item with no stats)into a rare item with random stats All the currency in PoE has a different useand some are rarer than othersadding value to them I will add a link in my list of links at the end of this review/guide where you can trade itemsand trade one currency for another You can also see the value of each currency therethe gem system has many of them In PoEskill gems can level like your characterhowever there are reasons to consider not leveling them For examplethe ""Cast when damage taken"" gemwhichcauses skills linked to it to be automatically casted when you take a specific amount of damagesometimes should not be leveledbecause leveling it increases the amount of damage you need to take in order for the skills to triggerwhich can lead to skills not triggering as often as you'd like Another example is the clarity gemthat gives you a mana regen aura Leveling it increases the amount of mana reservedwhich can be undesirable It is recommended that you research what changes with each level up for your gems Leveling gems also increases the level and stat requirementso if for whatever reason you lose some of an attributeall of a sudden you will not be able to use that gem anymore until you get moreordue to the increased level requirementyou will not be able to equip it on another character until they're higher levelgear in Path of Exile will rarely be equippable as soon as you get it: Those gloves you just got have amazing statsbut the sockets aren't the right coloror aren't linked! Which means you have to craft on them (crafting is the act of spending currency to modify an itemsuch as linking sockets with orb of fusing) Many times as a new player have I gotten an upgradebut screwed myself over by spending all my currency trying to craft on itor on something elseand not ending up with the result I desiredresulting in the item being put in the stash until I had more currency to use on the item Some management is requiredPoE is a great gameone of my favorite gamesand once you get into ityou can expect to be playing it for a really long time The relatively high barrier of entry might intimidate you as a new playerbut if you don't mind doing some research of game mechanicsfew games will provide the gameplay that PoE providesyour best friend when playing this game Almost any question about the game is answered here  [/url]where you can trade with other players [/url][/th]link is for witch but at the top there are links for other classes[/url][/th][th] Might be outdated depending on when you're reading this [/th] [/tr]so you can decide where to spend your points before even starting your playthrough [/url][/th]If you don't have a phone this game is for youAt the time of writing this review I have 2498 hours put into this gamebut find Diablo 3 underwhelming and the end game too boring and simplefarmingtradingtheorycraftingetc)including a major expansion every yearwith the exception of some quality-of-life upgradeswhich are not necessary in order to enjoy and play the gamewhere you can mix-and-match between skill gems; the unique items with special and sometimes build-enabling statsand the end game map system all contribute to a game that takes something simple and turns it very interestingI cannot recommend this game enough I have played WoWDiabloLoLCSHSHotSSCand many other games for countless hoursbut no game has ever kept me interested for the amount of time that Path of Exile has - it just keeps getting betterand the developers communicate a lot with the community in order to continue to improve the gamewaitit's freeMost expensive game on Steam3 kidsand a demanding job On any day if I can do 2 hours of uninterrupted gamingIâ€™m in blissyet interestingly unique and differentcomplexityand grind Yet it has flexibility and freedom to truly do whatever I want!I like to take a break from PoE every now and then and play a couple hours of lifeSimply the most in-depth Hack'n'Slash out there and the best according to me Character customization is top-notch and replayability is huge I have a little bit over 1k hours played on it (did not link the game to my steam account immediately) and I still  have many things to discover Howeverit is a ""hardcore game"" less accessible than Diablo 3 or others gamesalmost every build has drawbacks and strengthOne of the best (and true to form) ""Free to Play"" games currerntly available%10 item storage upgrades; Neither of which is an obvious ""Pay to Win""in no wayrestricted to any particular role or build with each starting classlv70+)without you having to register or post themyourself The public market is fairly well establishedbut this seems to be less of a problem as time matches onyeahI would say that this game is plenty of fun to play and their business model is one of the most generous availablethen give Path of Exile a try Chances areyou will not be disappointedGot leaped by Goatsrhoad from Rhoassmashed by Vaaltouched by the Godawaken by a Nightmare and lost in the Labyrinthalmost every build has drawbacks and strength)[h1]TL;DR: Go play the campaignit's great! [/h1]this will be a long reviewbut if you are a Single Player personor coop player at mostthat wants to try Path of Exile(PoE) for the first timethen this review is for youI always liked ARPGsand as it happens to all of usPath of Exile shadow looms large over the genre and your curiosity eventually gets picked up by it You probably have the same fears as mesurely it's designed in a way to force you to pay to complete the campaign""[/i]this is another No You can complete its lengthy 10 act campaign without spending a single coin in the game You even can complete it with all the characters and not pay a single dime And if you don't want to play with other people you aren't forced at any time to do so The microtransactions are mostly cosmeticsand extra space for the stash isn't really necessary for the campaignis the campaign that long? I have to dedicate my life to the game?"" [/i] Well here is where it gets complicateddo all the side-quests and hear all the dialogues It's structured in a way to avoid the classic ""win the game 3 times in NormalNightmare and Hell difficulties"" so that here the difficulty escalates as you progress through all the 10 acts So if you want to play casually just once a week to unwind and kill some monsters it's great! They really nailed how to sidestep the repeated playthroughs of the genre Kudos to the teamwhat about that crazy skill tree? I don't want to read a wiki or a guideI just want to play!"" [/i]that's why it seems daunting Imagine if Diablo 2 dropped all the skills of the 3 trees of each character in one screen PoE's skill tree is the result At first just focus on the path closest to your starting point (varies depending each class) Thenwhen you are comfortable with the gameyou'll start to see other ramifications and possibilities So feel free to experiment as you level uptry crazy combinations and see if it fits your playstylethe great thing about it is that you can do some pretty varied builds with it Active skills are another matter that I can't fit here due to the max char count of steam reviewsyesbut you have 400+ hours what did you do after winning the campaign?"" [/i]PoE's [b]Endgame[/b] Which is basically a gigantic map with something like 150 levels connected between them What I like about it's that it has a clear goal with it's own story related to it It's not just killing mobs to get better gearand so onwhere you feel like the horse constantly chasing the carrot Here you have to get better gear to kill the final(s) bosse(s) of the game Previouslythese were two ancient beings that created the Atlas (or something like that) and always appeared from time to time randomly and gave the end game some really interesting backstory NowPoE being a Game as Service kind of gamethings get changed up Sadly the Atlas changed and I don't find it as interesting as in the past with the new bosses (Conquerors of the Atlas)  I think it's possible to access the old bosses but it requires doing something special and it's not integrated into the Atlas like the current bosses But it still retains interesting aspects and mechanics that you should try all the same It's quite uniquehalf the Atlas ie) Most people just look up a guidecopy a build from said guideand even get the items needed for the build trading them with other playersso no lootingjust farming currency Yeah I knowkids these days right? I personally don't get any fun from equipping a player in an ARPG by farming currency and trading instead of earning your loot killing difficult bosses Or by copying someone else's character You can play like me and ignore the ""social"" aspectand without reading any build guides But the endgame doesn't seem designed for that as I said before since the Atlas becomes quite difficult You will need hours upon hours to reach a good understanding of the mechanicsit's nice to discover the intricacies of itbut the game may burn you out before you master it The good part of PoE being a Game as Service is that there is always new content as an excuse for you to go back and try a new characterwhat's that?"" [/i]going with a new one with each league isn't a bad idea But again forget challengesthey are only for the hardcore audience that complete everything in two weeks (probably less) If PoE isn't your only game or hobby after workthen the 3 months space may be too littleit's good It has some highs Some parts I recommend hearing/reading notes are the Labirynth backstory (a dungeon you have to complete without dying to earn points and make a ""Specialization"" for you character) and Daresso's story with the levels in the Colosseum Also Kitava's story in the last act as you learn it's origin is good But my favorite is the Labyrinth backstory of why it was created and all the rest that I won't spoil hereI do recommend a quick check of the wiki for the different ""horadric cube formulas"" so you know what to put in the merchant window to obtain certain currenciesI've been a Diablo fan pretty much my entire gaming life  One of my earliest childhood gaming memories was saving up my allowance to buy Diablo 2  I played D2 for yearsI preordered the collector's edition of Diablo 3 and stayed up all night on launch night to play itand since then I've put thousands upon thousands of hours into playing it  Why am I talking about Diablo 3 in a PoE review?trying to find a new game to catch my interestand I decided to finally try PoE  Now I honestly think I might never play Diablo 3 again  PoE is a true spiritual successor to Diablo 2  Diablo 3 went in a new directionmaking the game more casual and spectacle-focusedand dropping some of the more complex and esoteric RPG mechanics  I liked thisand I certainly don't think it was a mistake for Diablo 3and Diablo 2's clunkier but more complex and deep styleall of which are used for trading and for crafting in a variety of different ways  There's no standard ""classes""instead PoE's version of classes mostly determine where you start on the enormous and daunting ""passive tree""and you're rewarded with an incredibly deep game with a much more fleshed-out endgame compared to Diablo 3and nearly infinite build complexityPoE is fundamentally about the classic grindy gameplay loop of ""kill monsters to acquire gear to increase your power so you can kill higher level monsters to get more gear to increase your power level more etc etc etc""  The trick to these games is to have a wide variety of different builds and playstyles so people can keep grinding without feeling bored  PoE delivers this in spadesAscendancy classes that you unlock via in-game challenge puzzle levelsand other decisions you make in the campaign that effect your character allow for an insane level of complexitywithout even addressing the gear  Want to be a spellcasterbut who focuses almost exclusively on melee attacks?  You can do that  Want to be a physical brute that focuses on summoning minions?  You can do that too  Just about any combination you can imagine can be madethough obviously there's no guarantee it'll be any goodand the actual gear itself with all the incredibly deep and complex crafting mechanicsand you can make a truly mind-boggling array of different characters  Coming from Diablo 3 where there's usually about a dozen or maybe two dozen ""good"" builds in any given seasonI was flabbergasted by PoE where you can easily find hundreds if not more  The difficulty isn't in finding a decent buildit's in picking one amongst so many optionswhich is a double-edged sword  On one hand it's really nice to be able to skip the RNG and just trade for the particular item you want  I love being able to start a new altand use currency farmed from my previous characters to quickly just purchase everything my new character needs  That being saidsome rarer items will be almost impossible to affordespecially at the start  This means that some builds will simply be ""too expensive"" for you to playwhich is something that Diablo 3 doesn't have  Though the more you play the more you makeso eventually everything becomes affordable enoughbut don't let that fool you  You WILL be pressured into paying  The game MOSTLY sells cosmetics which are absurdly priced (dozens of dollars for a single cosmetic itemyikes!)but the real kicker is that they sell stash space  You start with an amplebut limited stash  You'll quickly find that the game floods you with huge quantities of lootand before long even just the stuff you really want to keep will start piling up in your stash  By the time you get to the end of the campaignyou'll be feeling quite a lot of pressure to buy certain stash tabs just for the quality of life  But let's talk for a second about the campaignin a good way  Your first time throughit'll probably take 20+ hours of gameplay to complete  By the time you've done it a few timesyou can power through it in a half dozen hours or soless if you're really hardcorebut you'll always need to do it because  it gives a lot of rewards that your character needs  Like Diablo 2the level cap is 100 but as you get into the 90s it becomes a truly insane grindso most people don't even bother attempting to get to level 100let alone reach it  Past a certain point you start losing experience when you dieand at the higher levels you lose so much that even a single death can cost you hours worth of farming to make back the deficitto go back to the microtransactionsyou'll feel pressured to spend $20 or so around the time you're finishing your first campaign  While I don't like being pressured to spendespecially in such a forceful wayit doesn't feel totally unfair to spend $20 or $30 on a game that you've already spent 20-30 hours playing  And once you've spent anywhere from $30-$60 on the various stash tabsyou should have more than enough space for just about anythingbut if you like ARPGs like Diabloyou should absolutely give it a try  There's a significant learning hurdle at the startbut once you're over it the game offers nearly endless replayability and a really enjoyable power progression and endgame that will keep you coming back3 Scoops of DiabloIf you like action role-playing game (ARPG) but have not played this game yetyou must Grinding Gear Gamesan indie gaming company with their entirely free-to-play gamehave created one of the most complexin-depth and innovative ARPG in the gaming industrythis game has one of the most fair and ethical business model you could ever see in the free-to-play market Absolutely nothing you can get with real money gives you advantage over other players This encourage players to support the game because they actually want to donate for the developing and its developers and not because they are forced to progresscartoonish RPGs The art style [they] chose for [i]Path of Exile[/i] is darkgritty and realistic"" The graphics are beautifully detailedthe music is iconig and the voice acting is outstandingwith a vast diversity in their mechanicscomposed by 1325 nodeswith non-linear progression (the tree is actually a web)so this is not what you will find here Of course there are Unique itemsbut having a full set of Uniques of the same theme/type does not grant you bonus mods This is meant to be this way to avoid forcing players to play with setsbreaking their character building freedomdivination cardsjewelsgear items (their categoryraritymodsgem sockets and links)are randomly generatedmods and can be crafted tooso the game does not dictate how the player is going to play These gems have level and attribute requirements according to their color (Strengthred;

0,"I've played this game on PC and Android and enjoyed it until the cheating and hacking just COMPLETELY RUINED my experience As I am typing this reviewI just finished a 30 player killing spree in the Bicheon Valley 3F on 1 single Darksteel vein of yellow quality Nobody fought back They kept teleporting instantly back INSIDE the vein (making targeting extremely hard) So after I killed every teleport bot and sent them to townI started mining darksteel to continue upgrading my gear and while I was miningon peacefull3 bots instantly teleported inside the vein (one of them even was red PK statusso TPs are legit unavailable to them) and somehow cancelled my mining process mid swing (no attacks as I don't have retailate set to on)I get interrupted again by the teleporter botshere I am complete red statusmy XP gain nerfed by 70%can no longer fast travel and to regain my clear PK status I have to kill approximately 7500 monsters of level +-5 of my own Pluseverytime I dieI drop a good chunk of my items on the groundnobody is miningnobody is looking at itkilling them makes no difference than to penalize you as they magically can take ownership of the vein by bugging your game client (the mine button becomes also unresponsiveyou have to walk 5m then come back to be able to re-claim it after killing them)very inefficient but they areyou need boatloads of quantities to upgrade and craft better gear Gear that can fail the upgrade process Gear that can catastrophically fail the crafting process making you lose said gear on top of currencies It is a korean MMO at heartso there is real grind in this gameas long as you aren't facing the other type of cheaters -> they use speed and small distance teleport hacksno cooldown on abilitiesno mana consumption They basically can do 5x your damage per second due to that while being extremely hard to hit or catch if they are running faster than the game design intendedthe developer has closed a  good chunk of European and Asian serverswithout merging them Straight out closing and deleting everything on them I've had a couple of characters on the older EU servers before I decided to stick to EU23they are all gone Amazing Imagine having also paid stuff for those characters in the cash shop The economy of those servers was so unbalanced that they decided to delete everythingauction house is also deadthere are only sellers Minimum price is 10gold per item/stack I've put up all my blue materials and gear at the lowest possible price Nothing sold in a week The catch? you can only buy and sell on the auction house with gold - the hard currency So somebody has to purchase in-game money to be able to buy stuff from other players to begin the trading chains It ain't happening as people buy gold from 3rd party sites (and get banned) cheaper than what the developer is offering Others just bot and cheat Funnyas the game has official bot embedded into it (auto combat and gathering)but on hard content like dungeons and raids you have to assume some manual control in order to not die every minute - and still people make ""better"" botseven if you wanna play this game as a legit MMO (with an Android UI and attrocious control scheme) I still can't recommend it for ""end-game"" as it will take you years to reach level 110 (the max level) and be the only player on the serverstill with crap gearit has officially kill any kind of drive to force myself to enjoy this gameI will give you that Nothing kept me more engaged since the age of PvP browser games It's 3 AM in the morningtomorow I gotta wake up for workI just came home from a wedding and I'm legit tired and sleepybut I needed to finish up this review and stop youthe readerfor wasting tens or hundreds of hours on this game in case it clicks with you Don't Better get a singleplayer RPG or play anything elseThis game has a lot of potential but it is overrun with bots and there is nothing being done about it  Bots have been an issue from the start of the game and all it would take is a few minutes of active attention on each server per day to identify them and ban them  Even if you dont get them all the first day the numbers will dwindle quickly  Normally you could just play around the bots but these bots are actually taking up the most valuable resource in the game  This resource can either be minedreceived as a quest rewardor purchased  The resource is used in over 90% of all craftingenchantingupgrading your character in anywayetc  The bots are able to teleportand knock you off of the resource without actually damaging you  This wouldn't even be ok if they did damge you so that you can kill them and get your resource backbecause there are so many bots they are programed to have one knock you off and another take the resource that way you cant kill the one who got your resource  Even if you do kill themthey can resurrect and teleport back to the node in seconds where it should take them several minutes to get back on auto run  Another issue is that pvp is so heavily punished in this game that if you kill a bot that was there just to take your resource and not damage youthen you end up suffering more because you can no longer gain xp at full value  Thats rightthe pvp penalty effects your growth as a player which is another thing the bots dont care about as they are just after the resource  Once you gain negative propensity because of killing a non hostile bot you are then freely targeted by other players while you try to get rid of the negative propensity  The penalty for killing one none hostile bot is -999 propensity which means you need to kill 400 monsters within 5 levels of you to get back to getting full xp againin game purchased based on luck  This means you spend real life money to have a chance at getting something useful  You would be better off burning your moneyat least then you could watch the flames and be warm in the coming winter  The gambling aspect of this game needs to seriously be addressed as you dont even end up with anything in the long run just ones and zeros turned into pixels that you cant eat or pay your rent with  Even if you want to try the game as free to playdon't bother because the pay to win players will always be able to keep you down  There is no hard work overcomes paid for advanceswho are in the top guild of each serverleft because that is all who will play it  Don't waste your time exploring when there are better games out there that actually care about the quality of the game play instead of making moneyFun grinding game on the go and actually had fun playing despite the bots and hackers present on the servershackers and NEVER and I mean NEVER purchase anything from their ingame store with real world money otherwise you will labeled a cheater and get banned 10 years or longerBraindead gameplay this if you don't know what to do with your lifethere is still 4gb on your hard drive on steamapps/common folderThis is a mobile game full-stop Auto combat Auto pathing Auto questing Tons of afk activities Absolute **** tons of things to level upand everytime you do there's a ! icon for you to click to collect some sort of rewards Cash shop is filled with ""time-limited"" items to create a sense of FOMOand the items themselves are mostly pay-to-advanceand thus I'm judging this as a PC title UI is straight up ported from mobile version without any adjustments There is no aspect-rationo FPS settingsno V-syncno nothing Every bells and whistles you'd expect from a PC title simply isn't hereforgettable soundtracksmeh story (idk whether this is translation issuebut still It's meh) Combat animation is pretty nicebut there is no depth to it whatsoever You get 6 skill slots to spam them over and over without the need for any variationsand let MP potion auto-use take care of the restlots of issuesBS game and NO you will never get rich with this game even with NFTStraight forward review and detailed Play 2 earn mechanics after 110hrs+ of gameplay:they removed the play2earn mechanics conversion on steam which is stupid If you're only playing for the play2earn mechanicsbetter have a stand alone pc version or mobile one cause you can't convert in steam Though you can still farm)NAEUSA servers and no you cant switch servers)read more if you are interested on how the ""play 2 earn"" workslike craftingenchantingenhancing etc You can farm darksteel in multiple ways like auto questing dailies or auto farming000 darksteel a day Thats minimum from auto farming dailies which takes maybe around 1-2hrs depending on the player farming the mobs as it gets crowded at times But if your game is only running in the background why not right? You can also get darksteel from main quests and other stuff You can also auto mine darksteel but I don't recommend that even on level 40 (especially on lower levels at mobs can AOE you while mining) as theres too much miners on a single map and there are no other channels for that map Alsoyou only get around 25-30 darksteel per 10 seconds if you have not upgraded your mine in your conquest You can increase your mining capability by upgrading stuff and equipping pets Higher levels offer higher darksteel daily farming000 darksteel = 1 Draco coinbut even as a long time mobile playerthere is too much cons for me to properly recommend this game Especially the typical gacha whale promoting multiple server they have Basicallymore serversmore whales will feel dominant and not be defeated by the other bigger whales on the other server Thats the whole point for multiple server mobile games More whales = More money for themthen this game might be for youCustomer support is simply non existent I got banned for a refund that I never asked for and my tickets are ignoredas well as my Discord messages Not worth the headacheThis game is a waste of time Banned my account with the reason of using 3rd party appDont bother with this chinese garbage gameheavily pay to win and is a mobile game port with auto attack and auto pathingThis game had potential A lot of itbut blockchain mining ruined it entirely Although grantedbecause it is a blockchain mining gameit has fulfilled its purpose and gone beyond with beautiful graphicsacceptable voice acting and a decent plot for a RPGI tried it because I wanted a new MMO that I could leave in the background while I worked It wasn't about the crypto Neither was it the case when I left I came back to the game a few months after they mass banned the hackers and accounts that violated the rules to see what has changed and if the game is fairer nowit's still fecking shit[/b]people like to assert dominance over another country to prove they're more superior than the rest of the world (Because honestly whyI don't know)NA is dominated by Spanish languageEU is dominated by Russian languageAsia is dominated by ChineseThai and Tagalog languages The translation feature that comes with the game is absolutely useless when modern slang or abbreviations are used in chatalthough acceptable to an extent for an idle MMOthe materials required are hard to come by and expensive to buy You can spend a lot of money on itand the drop chance is probably still just as shitthe game punishes a player's progress harder by making equipment and stat upgrades difficult to achieve due to the lack of material drop or the fact you need the blockchain minting currency to actually upgrade or craft anything that helps you progress further in the gamepoint 7 has it's pros and cons as it balances the game and the draco coin marketbut adding onto the fact that there are too many bots and miners who want quick money for little effortthis game is practically hard to progress by itself It's probably better in servers that are newer and has less people Otherwiseas a veteran player who has been in the first few servers the game ever came withit is no longer enjoyable to play leisurelyor even if you are here for the blockchain miningI would not recommend the game Howeveryou could find joy in this game if you have an aggressive personality and like to intimidate other players so you can do the blockchain mining yourself Or if you can understand the player's spoken language to begin with To each their owncheersCan't even solve botting problem Almost 75% of player base of this shit game are bots from china winnie the pooh kingdomCrypto/NFT garbagebut at least it's got jiggly boobsThis game is not fix yetthey keep banning Legit player for no reason i should rank this from 5star to zero star!!!The only reason anyone would play this because it has crypto/blockchain in itbut this is your typical auto RPG game where you literally just press and AFKnothing specialif you love real RPG then this is not the game for youbut ill give credit that visually its quite goodThe Chinese Government approves this gameSocial credit score +99Braindead gameplay this if you don't know what to do with your lifethere is still 4gb on your hard drive on steamapps/common folder"

1,"[h1]My Impression[/h1]continually evolving gamebut at its heartit will always remain [i]Space Ninjas with Magic[/i]... and weapons... tons of weapons.but let's make it short here:due to the steam restriction on the character limit for reviewsI will be putting the following points into a Guide:one which will entertain you for quite some timecombined with all the 'character quests'go ahead and finish this off with my personal verdict and then form your own opinion.where you will lack a guiding hand this game will suck you in.you will become lost in space and time will just fly by.but it is steadily being worked on and being improvedthe devs neither lack creativity nor daringto try new things.so just give it some time and see what it can give you back.I would be grateful for a 'thumbs up'if you didn't like ityou can give me a 'thumbs down' but I would be glad to hear your opinion on what you didn't like.This story requires a bit of setup.a friend of mine whom I'd known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder (called a ""Grandmaster"" in-game) called Warframe. A third person cooperative shooter with elements of Phantasy Star Online/Diablo loot runsprocedurally generated levelsand more content being added all the time. The game was difficult to startas there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers. Running along walls Sliding down ziplines SoonI was completely hooked; my friend and I were playing late into the nighttrying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weaponor trying to beat our best time on the Survival missions -- where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down. Over the yearthere were many great victorieshair raising last second escapesand new friends joining our little group. Many hours were spent joking around with each other on Skypecracking jokesblasting weird songs at each otherand coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases.new Warframesnew weaponsand new combat controls. The game still has its original stylebut it's so much improved. Last weekour four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions. The only thing that made us stop was getting tired.my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didn't show up that night. I found out on Wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition. The shock of it is still hitting us hard. The friendships that we had formed through the gamegone in an instant. It hardly feels real. I keep expecting him to log in and be thereready to do another defense missionand it's difficult to accept that we'll be going it alone now.the company that makes the gameand asked if there was anything we could do. They dedicated their 11/20/2014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air. Their reactions were heartfelt and touching. They really do listen to and react to the community.and form a clan or join one just because many items are clan-only)I recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community. They constantly improve it and add new contentitemsand weapons. There is a storyline that is unfolding. The voice acting is delightful. You could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it (real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of Warframes and weapons you can ownor buying things that you can't wait for).Digital Extremes. And rest in peaceWoxit.If you're here at the crossroads asking yourself ""Destiny 2 or Warframe?"" - then perhaps this review might clear a few things up for youI mean I grinded that game so hard for 4 monthsachieved absolutely everything possibleobtained everything and then never touched it again. Don't get me wrongI LOVED those 4 months. But this isn't a review about Destinybut rather about Warframe... And man is it a good gamethere certainly isn't  the type of hand-holding that Bungie provide you with in Destiny. Whilst this hand holding can seem helpful at the startit soon turns into a glass ceiling. Forcing you to go in a particular direction or playstyle - there is non of this in Warframe.you unlock one planet move onto a next and so onbut warframe really lets you choose how you tackle this. The weapon system in Warframe is a prime example of how open it is: You can pick a starter gunand because of 100's of mods availablethis starter weapon can still kick a** in mid to end game Every Primarysecondary and melee weapon feels unique and there are so many ways to alter these weapons: Want a machine gun that sets enemies alight? No problemjust add a Fire Mod Want a bow that fires 2 arrows instead of 1? No problemadd a multi-shot mod Want both of those? No problemadd both modswait till you try the warframes There are about 30 or so different warframes (basically characters) and each has 4 unique abilities. Each warframe is suited to a particular purpose: You like to control the sea and summon a Kraken to throw enemies about? Hydroid's your guy You like to set every enemy on fire and watch the world burn? Ember's who you're after Want to heal the rest of your teammates and be the lifeline of the team? Trinity is here And guess what? Yeppyou can mod these just like you mod the weapons: Want more shield on your tanky Rhino warframe? No problemwe got that Want more energy to keep using your abilities? Eyyy yepp that too And that's just 2 examples out of hundreds4 war wolvessome cat/fox breed and an epic looking alien bull All of which have their unique abilities and purpose... And yes you guessed it: You can also mod themyou can add armor piecesyou can add sigils (tattoo type things)you can add capesyou can change helmet style and you can change the colour of every single one of these pieces and aspects. The same goes for your companions and weapons. Also you can customise the colour and skin of your shipyou can even change the colour of the walls inside your ship There's ALOT to customise in this gameit's quite impressive.the community. This is perhaps one of the nicest and most pleasant social aspects of Warframe. The community is so closekind and caring. People have always helped me and some even gave me free stuff This really is unique in an online game and boy is it nice to see.I came to Warframe to keep me occupied and now I'm hooked. I STRONGLY recommend you try Warframeyou will not be disappointed. Great work DEfeedback and comments I'll do my best to answer a few valid points that I've seen come up in the past week or in the comments.I don't think the term over-powered can be used here. I think certain Warframes are more USEFUL than othersbut then again that will entirely depend on what mission or purpose you are doing. For example: Sure I can run through a difficult Spy mission with Ember (an incredibly offensive fire based Warframe) but I will have an easier and smoother time tackling it with Ash (a stealthysilentsingle target based Warframe).weapon or even companion is only as powerful as the mods you put on it. Meaning that you can completely transform a warframe from something ""meh"" to something godly just by using the right modsand good ones too But rememberthe better the modsthe harder they are to find / more expensive they are to buy with platbut WoW is the one I can think of right now): - World of Warcraft is a long-running game and like in Warframethe often beginner areas (which were created right at the start of the game) look barren and terrible. This is somewhat true about the first few planets in Warframecertain areas at the start look lifeless and without depth BUT as you progressthe planets become more detailed and graphically nicer.recently DE just remastered Earth (the first planet) and it looks MUCH nicer So be patientDE definitely know that certain areas look crud and they are working on it I'm sure I expect more planets will get a make-over just like Earth in the near future.Plains of Eidolon (the newestsemi-open world area) is not entirely what we expected but think of this: This is the first time DE have attempted anything like itthey clearly said prior to the release that they were expecting feedback and will continue to add more content to PoE. They are a small studio and don't necessarily have the resources that large studios like Blizzard or Activision might have. Give them timegive them feedback and be patient. I am almost certain that in the coming weeks DE will be adding more content and tweaking the existing stuff to make it smooth and enjoyable.Plains of Eidolon is not meant to be the bulk of the gamethere are still many other planets and things to do It's just a new area in an existing planet. Everyone chill and give DE some room to breathe and work things outthey have in the past and they will do so now too.There are very few games that have held my attention for 1000+ hours over the yearsthis is one of them. I created an account back when the game was still in Alpha (late 2012)back then it was was just a simple module with some enemies to kill with a handful of warframes to choose from. Even then though it showed promise. Over time they have added tons of contentnew warframesweapons galorenew planetsmission typesArchwing (fly in space)eventsclan dojos and foundryplayer to player trading systemsyndicates to joinplayer HUBs (relay stations)PVP8 player Raid etc etc. If you enjoy third person shooters4 player cooppvpraidingRPG's and/or ninjas in space (lol) this game is a dream come true then for you. Being that it is free to play there is literally nothing to lose checking it out.it is surprising the amount of variety in the game. When you find something you like it is a rewarding feeling and you will too it is just a matter of time. Also decent customization for your warframesweaponsSentinels (companion)Kubrows (dog companion)Liset (your ship)with a multitude of color choicesskins and attachments.they all have a total of 4. Some are better at being tankydpssneaking (cloaking)solo playhealersAOE damagedefense etc. There is a Warframe for every situation it seems. You can also make your own builds for each frame based on what mods you have (you attain them while playing missions they are dropped by enemies) For example ""Continuity"" mod allows for longer power duration timewhen you ability is activated. More ammodamage mods etc etc sooooo many. Making building your perfect Warframe/weapons very flexible and enjoyable. You have the opportunity to have a Primarysecondary and melee weapon. With the opportunity to make your own builds for everything here adds to the games replayability imo. Same goes for sentinels and kubrow companions they all have their own set of modsespecially made for them.especially for newer players. That is to be expected though being that it is an MMOish experience. Especially to gather enough resources and credits to craft your items. Well worth it though if you have the time to invest. Sometimes they seem to nerf warframes and weapons for no reason at all and then they rework it again and ""fix"" it. Nerf/Un-nerf is the nature of free to play MMO' ish kind of games. (Constant ""balance"" tweaking) This is not an instant gratification game eitherthe game gets better the more you play it. You can also purchase items with real money from the in game marketit is [b]NOT[/b] necessary though. Most things can be attained just playing the game gathering resources and crafting them accordingly. Exceptof course vanity itemsskinsunique color palettes and limited time only items that have been available over the course of the game.halloweenSt. Patrick's day etc.) Free weapons toothey seem to do somethings special on the games anniversary every year. The developer also listens to community feedback and designs and have added many things based on that. Which is always a plus. The game can also get repetitive at timesbut with the amount of content in game now that is harder to happen. You just have to mix it up from time to time and try new things within the game.but what game truly is right. There is a lot to enjoy here and unique setting and premise to the gamedefinitely sets itself apart from the competition.but at its current state I give this game a 4 stars ( â˜… â˜… â˜… â˜… ) out of 5Firstgood things about Warframe:quests and environments are fully disclosed to you on their due time. That being saidI HAVE spent money on this. Why? Cosmetics of course. Fashion is endgame you know?just what is Warframe? Warframe is a mostly PVE third person shooter action game with parkour elements flawlessly integrated into the gameplay. You have seen games do parkour before of coursebut these are space ninjas we're talking aboutwhich means you can basically fly around the stage at high speed while letting loose a torrent of bulletsrockets and/or high-energy plasmaor just take out your trusty sword/hammer/fists and cripple anything in your path.robotsaliensyou name it. Yesthere are bossesand they can and will kick your butt.and I mean HUNDREDS of weapons to choose from. Each of them unique in its own wayand deeply customizable to suit your needs and/or taste. You can carry three of them at a time. A primary weapon (bowrifleetc)a secondary weapon (pistolthrowing knivesand... other things)and of course a melee weapon.you can always tear through the game solobutfor the best experiencethe game pairs you with up to three other players in missions ranging from a stealthy rescue in the overgrown jungles of Earthto an all-out extermination in the frozen wastelands of Pluto.you also have a widely explorable open-world areawith its own assortment of missions waiting for you. And this open-world thing is only going get bigger in future updates. Oh and the updatesthey are a regular thing. Likeevery other day.reallythe game community is super protective of the game lore. There is a certain point in the game where you will KNOWand then we can talk about itbut until thenyou gotta find out for yourself. For now just consider yourself a space ninja.just like most modern mmos. The game will be just as hard as you want to handle. If you want to go at it casuallythere's content for you. If you're looking for a challengegood newsthe enemy level can scale up almost infinitely.bad things about warframe:lots of grinding.and you can buy more by using the premium currency. While technically you do not need to buy more slotssince you can simply sell what you don't need or wantit is a huge temptation and it is the most likely reason why you will buy platinumif you ever do.the grind is integratd into the core objective of the game. Grinding is what you do to pass the time. It is so integrated into the game world that you don't really notice it. So yeahthere is a lot of grindingbut you have fun while doing it.I'm not saying warframe should be game of the year or anything (more like game of the decade)but the level of attention and communication that Digital Extremes (the game devs) has with the warframe community and the display of love for their own game is absolutely marvelous. These people are setting a new standard for the gaming industryand I can only see good things in the future for them.we don't deserve Warframe.you can have a space dog/catand PET THEM. 10/10I've been playing Warframe for a very long time since 2013been hating itfanboying over it then hating again. Despite all the negative aspects of this game I still recommend trying it out.but let me tell you...the amount of grind this game requires is humongous especially in ""open world"" areas.you'll have to manually find answers in codex and wikiand there's way too much to learn as most of Warframe aspects are quite unique and can't be learned through playing other games alike.is a very repetitive gameyou'll often find yourself doing same thing over and over again be it farming resourceswarframesmods etc.with copypasta open world contentto very buggy and plain boring new mechanics and bosses releases. Development of the game nearly stopped and the focus of the game is now to monetize skinsbefore we hit 1 decent update around 70 new skins are released.raidsgood crafting systems (altho it has crafting in OW areas I wouldn't call it anything good or even close to be crafting)it's locked inside of progression system but quick google/youtube search could guide you how to start playing thru Quests within 10-15 hours of gameplay.this game doesn't have ""real cool shit"" to blow your mindthe graphics are not the prime of this gamehoweverwhat compliments it is - unique play models (warframes) and solid optimizationthis game can run on potatobeleive meI've tried.I would say revolutionarycompared to EAActivision etc.you can even get yourself 50/75% off deals from time to time when you log-inWeapons and skins/costumizations the core game is 100% playable and you can get all of it's content for freeexcept skinsbut...if you can spend alot of time playing it you'll get richor if you can't spend time playing the game but still want to progress faster you can dump few bucks and speed it up.you have bunch of unique Warframesweaponspowers and this game is really trying to make you as powerful as possiblelike clearing your screen with one button tap - that's Warframe.we still have the same stuff as we had before with minor additions and I just can't find a random lobby for archwing/railjack missions as no one plays them.this game has pretty massive one I'll give it thatfor a looter-shooter game it has pretty nice and unique story which you'll find in Quest cinematics and codex.while other games with less staff giving bigger and passionate updates.try itit's free... There's not excuse to ignore it.This game is good if you have:Seeing as Tennocon just happened a few days agoand has been gathering a lot interests since theni think it would be a good idea to finally make a review on this thing. I mean i have likewhat[b]1500 hours[/b] on this gameso i think i qualified to talk about this game.where its about collecting resources and items to craft new guns and armor so you can kill things in more ways. You play as a ""Warframe""which are basically space ninjas. Each Warframe comes with a set of abilities to make them all specialand their mobility allows them to get across the stages with easeand will become second nature before you know it.Warframe doesn't have a traditional progression system. All weapons and Warframes can only reach level 30which you can easily get in a hour or two. Howeveryour total rank (known as mastery rank) only ranks up when you level up new gearand some items are locked behind a mastery rank. This means that it doesn't take long for new players to reach the highest level with their gearwith encouraging them to try new things as they play the game.as you can experiment with different builds for your gear.[/b] even as a new people.meaning it has microtransactions...[/h1]warframe is one of the very best when it comes to thisAlmost all items can be bought from the games shopbut they cost alot compared to how easy some of them are. Its as if the game says: ""Looki get ityou dont wanna work to get that shotgunbut its gonna cost you quite a bit to buy it.."" The main you will be buying is instead things like weapon slotswarframe slotsboostersaccessories and so on. Theres also a trading system in the gameand it allows you to trade using the game's premium currencygiving the game its own economy.that's good and allbut what are the cons[/h1]this is still a loot shootermeaning there will be grinding at times. Sometimes its not so badother times it goes a [b]bit[/b] beyone extreme. If games with grinding doesn't suit you at allmaybe you wanna skip this one. But heyi've over 1000 hours on the gameand im still able to enjoy the game most of the time.but this is a basic overview of what kind of game it isand what you can expect from it. If you like what you hearthen give it a tryits free after all. Now if you will excuse mei have some [u]Prime items[/u] i need to get.I'm bored of this game. I can barely play it. A lot of the new content is more of the same. This is a common theme between veteransas you can see from several negative reviews from people with 1k+ hours into the game.it's not due to the game being unfun. The average player will find the game quite entertaining for the most part. There's just too high of an expectation of being able to play a game 10 hours a day and not get burnt out.you'll have spent more time in this game than you'd ever have on several ""AAA"" titles combined. And it's free. The monetization is absolutely fair (and extremely cheap). Seriouslyif you get a 75% discount on one of the Daily Rewards (not an uncommon reward)any plat purchased will net so much value and for a long period of time.Warframe is a bit of a mixed bag for me. I've had moments were I really loved it and there have been numerous moments where I've wanted to smash my desk with a sledgehammer.but what brings it down a bit is the numerous enemies that kill your momentum and the Co-op elements.but the little that I've seen thus far is pretty interesting.5/10and it runs great I might add. And I really like the designs for all the different warframes and cosmetics.I know some people are and kudos to you if you're into that stuff but I'm not.Relationships are temporary. The Void's embrace lasts forever.Free to play done right[h1]Player(s)[/h1]but most of the game is for 1-4 players.but gets better the more you get into it and the more you read item descriptions and little details. After that you have a pretty good story in many aspects.you can spend thousands of hours if you want toyou just need to dedicate timebut it's nothing particularly difficult.but skill will helpbut the basic gameplay stays the same.designingmodifying your character.looks goodbut at the same time everything can be completed by playing the game. As I said beforethis game has a lot of grindingwhich can be skipped by payingbut it's not p2w.if you don't like spending a lot of timegrinding and doing some things multiple timesthis game is nothing for you. But if you do like those thingsthis game is excellent. Especially the movement is just so addicting and you have so many different weapons/warframes/companions/planets/gamemodes.just try it outespecially since it's free. Have fun[h1] TL;DR [/h1]this game remains top of the looter shooter genrewith beautiful graphics (finally got a good PC lmao)lots of customization and lots of characters. You'll probably find the frame for you very quickly I have never played a game that was so perfect in regards to how it treats the customer. I have more belowbut just know in recent years so much storygame and UI improvements have been dealta universe thriving with lushhidden lore. The place where a species of technologically crudeand industrious Grineer have made home. The place where a plutocraticadvancedand money greedy Corpus have made home. The place where a technocyte plague known as the Infestation has made home. Ahand of course.. the place where youthe noblehonorableTenno; have made home.everything in this game can be earned for completely free. You know how I know? WellI've been getting EVERYTHING for freeand have spent a fair amount of hours to get this infothis game has more than a dumbed down skill tree. This game has a modding system. One which lets your power have billions of stat combos.Even the placement of mods will determine their effectivenessor platinum (premium currency)trading has you covered. There are people willing to trade you for modsgearand platinum.now this is a big one. This game Warframe has had so many updatesnearly on a monthly basis that it could EASILY have had a Warframe 2 by now. For a game being completely freethese updates are WELL worth your time. I mean hellwe've recently gotten our third open world. Completely. Free.undeniable factis that this game gets sweeter as time goes on. With monumental quests such as The Second Dream and The War Withinthis game will blow you out of your socks. Thoughfor somethis can take up to 100-200 hours to get to. It's crazybut gives you the best feeling and memory afterwards. Specifically the Second Dream touched my soul. I have played for 6 years or so and after all that timeto see the truth... I can't explain the feeling. I saved up and purchased the pre-order for the Second Dream's statue bundle to commemoratein the gameI was closest to my dear space mom. The LotusI know this is a random one but it can really hit you in the feels later on. Try looking up ""This is What You Are - Keith"" <- It'll bring you to a Warframe song that is too good..the grind was never bad because of my constant progressionbut for people who aren't patient or want things quickly (in a progression system) this might be a bit too much.but for some major loreand theories on ityou'll have to look it up on YouTube. If you'd like a good series I recommend StallorDthe enemy scaling might be too much. Not exactly the ENEMY itselfbut more specifically the ARMOUR on an enemy. It can be insane to even damage an enemy after level 100.more decorations should be addedAND massive group builds. I'm talking about decorations that require a load of resources. That way if you have a large and active clanyou'll have special things that show your true powerand richesa mark/bodysplit hould happen. What I mean is that you do a diagonal slash across the enemies backyet no deep cut appearsor body splitting? I dunnojust a requestseeing in the dark is crucial. Either an option to turn on and off the flashlight manually or nightvision would be greatly appreciated. I don't know about anyone else but seeing in the dark hurts my eyes sometimesoopsienote that this is all speculation and pure opinions I love Warframe If you have any questionsneed help in gamea clan to joinor notice anything spelled wrongor anything I should add.. please feel free to drop a comment in the space belowGet the Excalibur frame.pop open the Warframe wiki and look into weapon and frame crafting.control spacecontrol spacecontrol spacecontrol spacecontrol spacecontrol spacecontrol spacecontrol spacecontrol spacecontrol space.This game is good if you have:PROSthis is possibly the best platforming I've seen in a third-person shooter. High octaneto the point where sometimes I feel I'm getting motion sickness.the ""premium"" currencywhich means thatwith some patienceyou can actually get by in this game without spending a single penny of real-world money.sadlyare a biiiiit harder to recolorI think.VERY well-optimized. I play this game butter-smooth on my ages-old PC and wouldn't be surprised if it worked on my aging laptop.very grindy. If you just craft a Warframeit literally takes days (72 hours) before your frame is finished being made.showing that later content.Earth through Uranus feels very... ""samey""where you're just progressing from node to nodejunction to junctionand it will test your patience. Uranus/Neptune and abovethough? You begin to actually get PROPER quests. With cinematics and everything. Howeverthe game takes too long getting here... I feel that's why they plopped Cetus and Fortuna where they are nowto give new players a break from the node-to-node slog and overall content drought.when you hear odd sounds in Uranus sealab words... GET YOUR SCANNER OUT AND SCAN THE NOODLE MONSTERS[h1] Not pay to win [/h1]I want to dispell this notion. Anyone who tells you this game is pay to win is wrongor lying to you. Most of the good weapons are mastery rank locked and even if you buy things to bypass the grindyou still have to level those Warframes and weaponsyou still have to play the game to grind and get mods for your weapons and Warframes to make them actually perform well in end-game content. You're blindsiding yourself if you're going to make the argument that this game is pay to win. Now that I've gotten that out of the waylet's get to the actual review.because it's [i] so beautiful. [/i] Everything is well polished and good-lookingthe appearance of Warframe will not hesitate to immerse you into the environment. On top of thatgraphically the game is extremely well optimized compared to other gamesand can run on many older computers without an issue. There is no section of the game that is forgotten about in regards to visuals. Clearlya lot of love has been put into this game and you can tell that immediately just by looking at how beautiful and immersive the game is.seriously. You can earn Platinumthe premium currencyin-game without ever spending a cent on it. As for the Warframes themselveseach one is uniqueand there are over 35 of them. 35 That's a lot of different characters to choose from. Each of them has 4 unique abilities that do different thingsand you can typically mod a Warframe 3 different ways or more to focus on a specific part of their ability kit. That is a fantastic amount of customization and one of the things I love most about the game. I will say that the star chart content can get a bit repetitive at timesbut if you stick it outfill out your star chartand get into high level contentit'll feel less repetitive in due time. At higher levels the combat gets much more complex. Try staying for at least an hour in a survival mission if you decide to playand you'll see what I mean.looking good and uniqueness are important aspects of any videogame. Warframe has a ton of cosmeticsand they're all extremely beautiful and wonderful. Once you get through all the star chart contentyou may find yourself grinding for Platinum to purchase a new set of clothes- or outright buying it with real moneyI won't judge you for it. In factsome of the best cosmetics in the game can only be purchased with real money- the TennoGen cosmetics are handsomely crafted with love by individual creatorsand your money goes back to those creatorssupporting them and allowing them to make more wonderful content for the game.Warframe probably isn't for you. I would still give it a go even if you don't like those types of gamesbut you're probably not going to enjoy it if you aren't a patient person. Grinding is the name of the game in Warframeand RNG affects many activities in the game. If you don't like the fact that you aren't guaranteed certain things and have to wait for warframes and weapons to finish building before you can use themor that you have to farm resources to build themthen you probably won't enjoy the game. Stillif you invest your time into the grindyou can acquire nearly anything you want for no cost at all.we get new Warframesquestsand contentalbeit they can be buggy at the start. We received Sanctuary Onslaughta new gamemodeand The Sacrificea new questearlier this yearand we're getting Fortunaan open-world area on Venus later this year. That's a lot of content for one year While it's not always the best and most optimized contentI see more love poured into Warframe content than that of any other game at the current time. The devs maintain a strong relationship with the community and actively ask questions to the players about what they want to see and what they want changedand do frequent livestreams for fun and for discussing where they are in terms of development with the game. Their strong community commitment is one of the great things that many people love about Warframe- DE's transparency and willingness to maintain a strong bond with us is something that not many other game companies can brag about.if you read my entire thing and some of my points sparked your interestI would definitely reccommend giving the game a go. I have loved every second I've played of Warframe and I can honestly say it's one of the only games whose future updates I'm currently excited for. There are no downsides to trying the game out- after allit's free to play and if you don't like the grind then you can stop at any time and uninstall the game. There's no paywalls or money barriers to any of the content in the game. It takes time to grind for resources and build thingsbut if you can develop patiencethat grinding pays offand the game will only get deeper and more complex as a result.It's the game where i met most of my friends and its hard to meet toxic players because its mainly PvE. Overall the devs are extremely generous and for the most part listen to the community also.. RED TEXT"
1,"Pros:Naraka is personally a 10/10 game for me. Most fun PVP game I've played in years. I have over 1000 hours in PUBG and Apex Legendsbut this game does not really feel like a traditional BR. It's more like a fighting game somewhat similar to Mordhau while being hands down the best action combat/melee multiplayer game I have ever played (and I've tried several). The overarching BR element takes a lot of inspiration from Apex Legendswhile feeling different enough to not feel like you're playing the same game.the Souljade system adds a lot of variety in gameplay. Each melee weapon has a variety of options for attacks and combos that make the game not feel repetitiveinstead becoming very addictive and rewarding for improving in. The skillcap is not that highso even new players have a chance against the best players in the game if they read a few games and get enough practice. Unlike other gamesin Naraka you never feel like you can't beat even the sweatiest player. The grapple and free climbing system is absolutely amazing considering that you can grapple and climb almost any object you see. It has the best animations I have seen in an action combat game (and its not even close)even subtle things like shimmying around corners has its own animation. The game does not feel janky at all unlike other games I have played recently (New WorldBF 2042 BetaElyon). I have not encountered a single bug like falling through the mapgetting stuckglitching through objects etc which is remarkable considering you can traverse and climb EVERYTHING.weapons and environment are fantasticthe audio for each weapon and hero abilities makes them all unique and you can easily tell what is going around you. The UI is very intuitiveminimalist and easy to use. The gameplay is very fluid and you can even cancel animations without the game feeling janky or glitchy.region switchinglong queuesstrange ranking system. But all of those issues all boil down to a low player base (at least in the West). Difficulty is the other issuethis is a game that will turn away a lot of new players because those who are experienced will smash their face in. It is a hard game to start as you will get rolled...a lot. But for those that stick it out they will [hopefully] see what a masterpiece this game is.there is no pay to win in the gamelet me repeatNO pay to win in the game (incredibly refreshing for an Asian developer) The shop has plenty of great skins that can be bought outright to balance out the best cosmetics being locked behind RNG. You can play the entire game without being disadvantaged for the base price. The only thing locked behind a grind are the glyphs but it takes only a few days to get all glyphs maxed out to be on fair ground with all opponents and teammates.fun and fluidity. I primarily rate a game based on how FUN it is to play and for me 99% of that comes from the gameplaynot how shiny the environment is. In Narakaeverything WORKSit feels GREAT to playits a whole lotta fun if you invest the time to get better. It feels rewarding to duel someone and come out on topor hunt someone downthird partyget a multikilla clutch playa snipea satisfying ultietc. The game feels incredibly well made and I think the developers put a lot of thought and love into everything.it's a real gem that is sadly being overlooked in the West and I really appreciate that there's still some developers out that are focusing on gameplay over glitz and glamour.This game is actually a lot of fun.but watching good players it tends to look pretty fluid and complex so I'm sure there is just a skill cap there. Go watch a Youtube vid about itit will pay off.This is the best battle royale game I have ever played.parry beats chargedand charged beats basicmaster this and you can get many kills)you still can win the game with default outfitstrio and deathmatchplease understand that not all good games should be freeboth paid games and free games have their own advantage and we should understand that.

You either die as a casual or live as a progamer.You've probably seen 100 reviews on the fact that the gameplay is funso I won't touch on that. It's a pretty typical battle royalebut with a heavy emphasis on melee combat instead of ranged combat. It's funthat's about it.and the thing 99% of these reviews have been talking about.when you purchase the game you own every single character (currently releasedI'm sure they'll make you purchase characters later down the linebutI can't review something that isn't released yet). The game has various cosmetic microtransactionsa battlepasslootboxesweapon and character skins. The game allows you to make customizations to every character (like an MMO character creator) at absolutely no costallowing you to make some genuinely hilarious creations.a simpler time. Overwatch had just released. It was a $40 gameand also contained various microtransactions. It provided all characters free on releaseand... wellyou see where I'm going with this. The monetization strategies have ZERO in game influenceaside from cosmetics.that's understandablebut make sure you're able to put this game in perspective when you look at it's price.and this game does chug at certain moments (mostly when grappling)at the time of writing thisI haven't tried fucking with graphics settingsbut that might fix it.I'd give the game an 8/10. Aside from the less than stellar optimizationthe monetization is no more aggressive than 99% of other video games these days. CS;GO started as a pay to play game with lootboxesso did Overwatch. Worst case scenariogive it a shotyou can always refund it.I'm like Samurai Jack my katana is always with me[b]GameEngine:[/b] Unitywith the rise of cheaters in this gameit's to give a fair warning on this game.get some weapons and fight with martial arts and multiple abilities.read up on NeacProtect and how easy it is to bypassbut up to 40 a game...)lots of bots.the gameplay is uniqueI hate BR games but love Narakabut with the rampant cheating.the abysmal MMR system. I can't recommend this at all.stay away.then sure try it. For nowsave your money for a salesince they have a battlepass.but there's so much more.(Review Subject to Change)ranged combat strategy. Feels well donethe movement is not clunky and the combat for the most part is pretty fluent. The character editor is fun and of-course the cosmetics are nice.  Ive logged many hours in this game and can really see what needs adjustments.your attacks phase through their body. So as you can see why all the top players are chinese.the weapons and heroes need much balancing. As I am sure most people have noticed being grappled hook stun spammed. This could easily be fixed by disabling Auto lock on Melee and Hooks in ranked play. This in turn would make the game more skill based and the engagements more interesting. Instead of being grapple stunned for people to long sword slash spam you. Heroes such as - need some work. His 150m range grab not only needs to be much sorter (Id say about the range of a grapple hook with 50%+ range) and it also needs a cool down (5-8 seconds). You could give him a small AOE ground pound to make up for the CD wait time. Long Sword Slash needs much fine tuningthe Katana stun lock needs some workthe spears whirlwind attack needs some adjusting as wellect ect...its interesting enough. The issue is with the way the character grabs onto ever little thing and you tend to get stuck on it. Some objects such as small rocks need better clip nodes so the characters and step over them a bit easier instead of just coming to a full stop and then getting stuck.lock the ping to keep the ping abusers out (You know who you are) and re-balance some of the heroes/weapons. I would be not only thrilled with thisbut would give this a positive review. As I am sure a lot of you would as well.**WARNING: HOT TAKES AHEAD**but the developers probably bent over and let NetEase force a lot of the obvious Eastern market standards onto the eventual release. That or the Montreal studio is a literal front.you'll be playing with Chinese players most of the time.essentiallyfabricate false first impressions of the game and make you feel like you're goodthus selling you passed the refundable time period. I played about 3 gameswon the first and last but lost the second. Honestly I should have lost all 3 I'm terrible at BR games in general. Winning those 2 games with over a fourth of the lobby's members really rubbed me the wrong wayfalse positives and all.it's got:probably the best kit in the game. Make of that what you will as skill is obviously a factorfurther milking the horny.not sure if it's runningif you encounter that you'll probably want to go check your task manager for the only task running in Chineseor at leastincomprehensible enough looking exe name.I think this game should be F2Pit's pretty and all but man does it feel forced. I'd recommend trying Spellbreak if you want to fill that non-FPS Battle Royale itch. I don't really recommend this game's community/socials eitherlots of people willing to lose their cool over your negative review on the game.This game is actually a lot of fun. It's a high-paced BR that can be overwhelming at first but is fairly straightforward once you get the hang of it. Only leaving this review as a not recommended because they don't region lock players. Playing in NA might as well be playing on Asian servers playing against a bunch of 500 ping players who can't be hit. If they start enforcing region lockingI will change my review.HERES A REVIEW THAT DOESN'T CRY ABOUT THE MTX SHOPSjust don't buy the cosmetics. I don't get the issue.just learn the game instead of crying that you died to things you don't understand.disarming the opponent.left click attacks are typically horizontal while right clicks are vertical. Side step vertical slashesback step horizontal.then parry in the window between the 2nd and 3rd attackallowing you to parry the third Focus.immediately going into a sprintthen holding left or right click for your Focus attack. You'll then charge your Focus attack while sliding in the direction you were using it.If you can put in the time to learn its mechanicsthe game is fun and plays like a fighting game with fast pacedfluid movement.it's not worth playing or buying until a ping restriction is implemented on servers. Combat mechanics fall apart completely when playing against players that connect to servers overseas to avoid playing in their own region. On the NA serverlobbies frequently have more of these overseas players than actual NA region playersand this problem is exacerbated depending on the time of day you play.A-Friggin-Mazing  I can't remember the last time I spent this much time on a video game.  This is a very fresh take on the Battle Royale feel.  Surethe same concept of getting to the circle has been done.  But this combat?  The characters and abilities?  The CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATIONS?  Truly I had no choice but to come on here and write about this because I need to do my part to make sure everyone gets this game  It is a BLAST and although as frustrating as it can be learningthat moment you master counteringand dodging in the split second that it counts is so rewarding  Now I just need  to find gaming friends to enjoy this with.  But shout out to all the work that went into this because this game is the best.  I've never been so glad to have a nice computer to be able to play it on.  P.S - you should definitely try and look at some of the tutorials online to help you learn tips and tricks from beta.  It is actually extremely helpful that they give you a tutorial at the beginning but I'm finding myself just looking at videos online to get better.  Good luckBoobabooba"

to gain more knowledge and possibly think of new strats You have to start from the VERY BEGINNING  If you play without speed decksyou're going to be completely washed up after thisexcept the ""ZWAT"" outfits maybebut it needs some heavy polishingNow I like this game Feels like left 4 dead but modern and fresh The only reason Iâ€™m not recommending it is because you are basically penalized for playing solo campaign You do not earn any currency or progression by playing solo and I donâ€™t agree with that Not everyone wants to play a game like this with people and progression towards currency and achievementsetc should not be locked for doing soIt's a good gamebut not worth $60 Wait for it to go on sale[b]Warning #1:[/b] Do not expect this to be Left 4 Dead 3 If you expect thisyou are setting yourself up for some disappointment It also restricts progression if you play it solounless you play with someone who has bought them -- in which caseyou'll be forced to download and store

qualities:from environments to charactersand lightingextensive color blind optionsyou will have fun running aroundand being able to use them all in Fort Hope right away is also coolbut would benefit from more places of utility in future updateseven if questionable decisions were made It's now just a matter of the community keeping future decisions in check -- since we won't be able to do any of that ourselves with modslook up Chet Faliszek's ""Anacrusis"" Discord server -- those are the other ex-L4D devs who actually careLove the game but please let us remove attachments and set it up on a better weapon when we get oneThe developers have proven with the November update that they truly DON'T listen to user feedback and lack the courage to be transparent about their unsurprisingly unpopular game decisions It was questionable whether this game was worth the $60 price tag given the dearth of content Andwith their most recent ""update"" reinforcing what makes the game bad (success on higher game difficulties being heavily swayed by enemy RNG)while nerfing things that make the game fun (builds that actually allow you to participate in combat despite the enemy RNG) tips the scale quite negatively The current ""meta"" to improve success on higher game difficulties is to just speedrun though each leveleffectively skipping over sections of the maps highly sensitive to wild enemy RNG that borders on simply being bullshit It's as if the developers don't actually play their own gam---waitthat's probably truethat seems to be getting worse with each updatedo yourself a favor and play this for $1 on Xbox Game Pass (which has a PC version) That way you'll only be disappointed for wasting $1 on this impending failure of a AAA gameI wish I could give this game a mixed option I love co-op games so much in the classic Left 4 Dead styleand I do enjoy this game The gun play is a lot of fun and there's a lot more weapons to choose from than in classic titlesso when I'm done with work for the dayI don't want to spend two hours trying to find teammates that are more invested in the game than racial slurs The bots in this game are GOD AWFUL In Easy difficultyyou can plow through the first half of the gamebut the second half starts to get sticky with the AI The first half on Medium difficulty is a good challengebut the second half is practically unbeatable The bots are constantly walking directly into your line of firegetting stuck on everythingthey don't heal when you ever actually need itand good luck playing with any melee buildsyou're not allowed to unlock anything when you play solo Cardscosmeticsachievementsetcespecially by the time you're actually old enough to buy this gamebut for the most partit's all pretty copy/pasteespecially when you compare it to the contrast of classic titlesI'll gladly update thisbut for now I'd wait for a sale Especially if you play aloneAfter about 50 hours in the open beta and 40 in the final releaseI feel comfortable saying it's a pretty good gamethere are some valid criticisms to be made The easiest difficulty is incredibly easyand the next is significantly harder This difficulty curve really feels like it punishes individual players who don't have a group of friends to play with It's a very team-oriented gameand to call playing with randoms oonline""hit or miss"" is being generousthe recruit difficulty does very little to prepare you for just how team-oriented the game is If you play this like you would play Left 4 Deadwhere all the characters are interchangeable and you don't need to worry too much about weapon types or skills each player usesyou can beat recruit fairly easilybut you will never beat the other modes Howeversince many people will begin on recruit and see these strategies workit won't be apparent just how important player specialisation is It can give players who start there a false sense of how they should play the game and set them up for frustration laterone of my biggest complaints is the continue system It is unnecessarily punishing without contributing virtually anything to the fun of the game I can recognise that some players may value the challengebut forcing us to replay multiple levels because of some bad RNG feels like bad designespecially on recruit & veteran I would disable it if I couldand hope that a future patch will make this an optionhoweverI find the game incredibly fun with a high degree of replayability There are definitely some things I could suggest to improve itbutoverallI think it's a very solid experiencetoo easyor less funbut in the later acts it can still be a challenge Plus it's a great way to unlock some cards before trying the harder difficultyand the order of the decks matter You draw the cards in order every timeso space them out accordingly You can see ahead of time what missions you'll have andassuming 1 card per missionyou can tell when you'll draw a certain card Use this to your advantage to get the cards you need right when you need themand your team should have one of each Whichever you are usinggo all-in A jack-of-all-trades build sounds good on paperbut you will pay for it in harder difficultiesbut that's entirely wrong You can customise to your heart's contentand just because something works for them doesn't mean it will work for you Using their strats or decks can be a good starting pointand may even work wellbut you should not believe anyone presenting them as the ""best"" or the only ""correct"" build Tweak it until it works for *you*and having fewer things unlocked just gives you things to look forward to You aren't worse for itand everyone's been where you areso don't stress and enjoy the gameIts an amazing gamebut definitely needs some things fixed!more like $30-$40 at most!fun game with friendsim so sorryFOR SOLO/LONE WOLF PLAYERSDon't go in expecting Left 4 Dead 3In the November UpdateTurtle Rock Studios pushed ahead their design choices that reduce player-strength overall when difficulty was one of the major criticismswhile not addressing in-game issues that aggravated the player base for the first month The incomplete update and ""fixes"" also introduced new bugs and changes that were not listed in the patch noteCleaner passive being randomly disableda Cleaner being launched into the sky and dying to fall damage after grabbed by a Stalkerand many more (including those from Open Beta as well)attack patternsamountsand spawn locations of Special Infectedand the lack of countermeasures against themespecially having trouble navigating through tight corridorsand the player base had been suffering (and still going through) the aforementioned problems for more than 3 weeksthe backlash from the community has been significant It's because of the inconvenience they had to experience from launch issuesand the game was already difficult to begin with They've been claiming the developers are out of touchhave the wrong priority listand need to play their own gameI find myself agreeing with themit's even messier now Post-patchthere are new bugs that allows people to throw grenades indefinitelyplayers receiving 1 Trauma despite Temp Health COMPLETELY protecting Health lossbosses appearing at levels where the level design could not properly handle them in the first place (ie Hag at Resurgence unable to disengage due to getting stuck on a wall)this is a disturbing sight to watch I have shelved the game for nowand am planning to monitor how situation unfoldsand release properly tested updates if they wish to continue servicing the gameDefinitely not worth the Â£60 price tagmixed with many poor / questionable game design decisionsoverallextremely poorly designed In terms of visualssoundand the way that they workand the way you can counter themin Left 4 Deadeach special infected has a very clear silhouette The SpitterChargerBoomerJockeyetcall have very distinguishable visuals Very easy to identify On top of thatthey play very easily recognizable sounds right before spawningso that you and the team have time to react to the fact that they are there And most importantlythey were all designed so that you are able to counter their attacks if you have the skill and reaction to itit plays a sound right before attackingand the tongue takes a while to reach you During this timethe smoker is very weak so that you can quickly locate and shoot it if you are fast enough Additionallyyou can attack the tongue with a well-timed melee attack as well  For the hunter and jockeyyou can either backtrack and forward-charge with a shove attack to make them stumble temporarilyor even do a well timed shove while they are in the airright backing attacking you I can keep on with these examplesnone of these nuances are to be found in Back 4 Blood The special ridden seem generally designed to be tanky as hell (able to soak up a whole lot of damage)with attacks that does not in any sense seem designed to have clear counter-mechanics that you can employ The Tallboy just walks towards youuntil it does a last-minute sprint of godlike speed to grab you (if it's the crusher mutation) The spitter variants of the special ridden just have projectiles that fire at the speed of lightmaking you unable to dodge themall you can do is try your best to find cover while their insanely low cooldowns means that they just keep on spamming attacks on you The Retch can spew vomit from 500 km awayalso at high velocity And what they all have in common is that they are basically extremely tanky In any casethe best ""counter"" you end up employing is either to run like hellor simply shoot them as fast as possiblepraying that they don't reach you before you do Now you can try doing this with 5 Tallboys and 4 spitters / hockerswhilst you have a reeker running towards you I guess because they were too incompetent to come up with better designsthe best way they can increase the difficulty is just to throw all of this at you at oncebut in practice I think it works poorly with the rest of the gamewith assault weaponswith shotgunsetcand I don't think it plays nicely with balance and corruption cards either In generalit doesn't play well with the overall dynamic and ""adjust as you go along"" type of game that B4B tries to be with corruption cardsyou can make a build that makes you good with a certain type of weaponsure But you will not exactly be sure when you will be able to get a good quality weapon of that type because the weapon drops and the store weapons are random This will matter a whole lot of harder difficulties Getting what you need for your build to work best will be at the mercy of the RNG godsdecks are very static by nature You create a deck You choose one at the start of your runand then you are locked to that deck for the entirety of that run No matter what corruption cards are thrown at youand no matter what else happens in the game This means that even though the game tries to be dynamic and throw you surprisesyou generally can't use your deck to adjust to any of it Your deck is what it isand at any one point (after each level)you will only be able to pick 5 cards from your deckalso taking into account that the sequence of cards matters as well This leaves you very little wiggle room to do any meaningful choice regarding your cards once a run has startedI don't understand why they don't just do away with the concept of decksand simply allowed people to choose from the entirety of the card pool at the beginning of each level You will still be able to create builds the same way you do it with decksthe only difference will simply be that players are more free to pick and choose as the game progress It seems very arbitrary to lock people at a pre-defined stack of 15 cards What good does that do?balancing with the card system is also a bit off When you get to higher difficultiesthe powers and abilities of cards matters a [b]lot[/b] But by the very nature of the designyou will always start out weak At the start of the runyou will always have fewer cards than at the end Meaning the game will at times be harder simply by the fact that you don't have access to as many cards as later it's just odd compared to being equal in power throughout an entire Act / campaign But maybe that's just meand ruin the overall impression[b]no manual toggle flashlight[/b] Really? Apparently modern game design loves to take step backs on what seems like obviousbasic functionality A decade old game like L4D (and many other games) did this Why can't I toggle my flashlight? Seriouslywhy? There are many times where I've wanted to toggle the flashlight where the game did not do it for me And if I have to hear another fanboy tell me to simply ""adjust my brightness"" I'll go crazy Why should we have to make either game-wide or system-wide adjustments to make up for such an extremely simply feature that would be so easy to put inin the first place? Againit makes no sense[b]removing attachments cannot be done[/b] Againwhat is this insanity? And yesI knowthey are working on adding a card that does it But seriouslya [i]card[/i]!? WHY can't it just be something you can do? The only thing this atrocious design decision has done so far is basically punish me and my friends from picking up higher tier weapons because we have had lower tier weapons with better attachments With all other things that go on in the game of RNGwhy should it be a risk to pick up another weapon and just pray to the RNG gods that you then get the attachments you want later? I just don't understand itcar alarms and door alarms are designed extremely poorly in relation to projectiles You can trigger cars and doors miles and miles ahead in the level that you have no chance of currently seeingbecause there seemingly are no radius at which the player has to be within before shooting alarms triggers them This doesn't provide any good No amount of skill will be able to get you out of that situationbesides constantly shooting towards the ground Maybe you think that's good designI certainly don't You're punishing the player for something he/she is not yet able to react tonot really recommended Go play something like L4D instead :)Back 4 Blood is a pretty weird game Is it good?

1,"My wife & I enjoy this game together :) We love the co-operative clean fun & challenges :) She doesnt have a lot of mobility because of a rare disease so this is a way for us to get out - Thank youI bought two copiesone for my seven-year-old daughterand one for myself. I host a non-dedicated session and invite her through Steamand we spend hours tranquilizing dinosaurstaming themand collecting them on our island. I use the cheat codes to spawn all the items we want (using the ark wiki and double tab) and we have a great time. I recently purchased two copies of Scorched Earthand we spawned in tons of air conditioners and wyvern eggs to hatch baby dragonsthen we spawned in a bunch of wyvern milk to grow and tame them.as kids arent really the target demographicbut I thought Id give it a thumbs up anyways.This is a review of the offline game.we ran around killing everything. After about 30 mins of running and killing things I decided to go home and give my new buddy a rest. We ran through the night and in the morning i realized how extra lost i was and got worried. I decided that the best way to find my way home was to climb a mountain and look around. After 5 mins or so of looking and referencing the map I finally figured out where we were. Just as I was about to put my map away I was ambushed by several scorpions and unfortunately they killed me.Note: At least 1000 of my hours were spent on Official Servers. Thus my review will pertain to Official Servers.these people will either be total jerks and just kill you over and overor they will be really chilland youll form a tribe with them.  You will spend countless hours with these people: farming materialstaming dinosaursand build bases.  You will grow more and more in power.  You will be meeting other players either passing through the server or settling down.  You will know all the other tribes on the server that are worth knowing (i.e. the big tribes or friendly tribes).  You will come across numerous other cultures as you find Chinese tribes and Spanish tribesFrench and Germanall while growing more and more powerful.  You will on occassion have a set backbut at this point youre on a roll and now the games mechanicshave a good group of friendsand objectives that you have given yourself.  You will feel happy with what you have accomplished.while it can be delayed for long periods of timeit will eventually come.  And so another tribe will pick a fight with you.  Your tribe will fight their tribeand you may lose or you may win.  Either way youve invested a lot into this server and these friendsso youll never give up.  Some other tribes will jointhe fightpicking sides.  The winning side will probably kill all the dinostake all the matsand kill everyone on the losing side.  Thus you have won your first war.  You are now a power on the server worth being reckoned with.  Soon enoughyoull get in an even bigger war as the losing side draws more and more people to aide them and you respond by getting more as well.  Now the entire server is split 50-50and a great war mars the server for days as both sides are constantly wiping one anothers bases.  Eventually youll win thoughand the other side will leave the server.  Theyll be fed up.  As the enemies are now goneyou are happy once more.  You hated them just as they hated you.a couple weeks.  There is trouble brewing as a few of your allies are begin to grow wrestless and have infighting.  Peace will try to be maintained through talks.  But it will fail in the endand more war will arise.  This cycle will continue until only 2 tribes remain.  These two tribes will be dominant in every regard: leadershiptacticsdinosaursand materials.  Pitted against one another to see who will rule the server.  You will fight your heart out against your former allies.  You will destroy bases youd once entered as a friendnow as an enemy.  You will kill dinos whose names you helped come up with.  You and your tribemates will be cycling out who gets to sleep because the battle will last over 24 hours.  The fight will go on and on and on and on with no end.  It will be exhilerating.months ago when you were just a little tribe starting outwill all be gone.  Everyone youd ever fought with and fought against are gone.  While there is some joy in victoryit is very bitter as there is no one left to share it with.  Your tribemates will still playbut its not the same.  Even if not in your tribeyou had a community. Friends. Foes. Maybe even lovers.  Now all that is gone.  You will pass the ruins of these once great tribes and feel a hole in your heart.  New people will always arrive to challenge youbut youll always beat them down.  Destroying any hope they had.  Youll build fortresses thatll reach the Heavens and have so many dinos itll cause server lag.  Youll build Great Walls across vast territories in order to denote your power.  Finallyyoull get bored and leave.and one day youll see Ark still in your library and hop back on.  Youll log back into your old server.  Everything is different.  New namesfacesbaseseverything.  Not a single structure you had built is left standingnot a single ruin.  All of it is gone.  The people on this server see you log in and ask if you want to join their tribe saying that Ark can be harsh for noobsbut you could never tell them.  You could never tell them an entire servers history.  The hundreds of thousands of hours of work youd seen put in by that ancient world.  The structures they couldnt ever even imagine.  The wars youd fought and people youd met.  You could never explain to them what it all had meant to youfor it is all now gone.  In its place is a new worldcompletely distinct from the original while maintaining a strong similarity.  You will be both extremely happy at this new worldand profoundly sad about the world that was lost.no game will ever make you feel as strongly about the decisions youve made than Ark: Survival Evolved.  Beware that you may get addicted and lose your real social life and ambitions in exchange for this game.  But youll meet people youd never have met otherwisesee things you never thought possiblecommit acts that would make tyrants think youre true evil or saints believe you are the second coming of Jesus Christ.  In the endyoull feel stronger emotions then any youve ever felt from playing a game.Since most people are bashing the PvP servers for the griefingI feel like someone should answer that and also talk a bit about the PvE servers.about half of that on PvP servers and half of that on PvEall official ones. All the thing people say about the griefers is truetheyll kill your dinossteal your stuffabuse your body and destroy your house as soon as you go to sleep. In fact a lot of tribes organize group to play past midnight for the sole reason of hunting sleeping players. And thats the keyword here TRIBES. If youre playing on a PvP server you gotta keep in mind that youre not supposed to do it at your pace and take your time building your little Tatch hut with its little thatch fence with your Raptor and a couple of Dilos. Slowly learning the game by yourselftaking everything ineventually upgrading to Wood and then Stone and so forth.maybe even a weekbut alone youre doomed to be foundrobbed and killed. And like many others saidhave the work of a whole week go down the drain. If youre joining a PvP server youre doing it for Tribe warfare and let me assure youthing can get really intensereally epic pretty fast. With eagles swooping down to grab enemies and droping them from high altitues to their deathsor tactical droping Raptors inside their base to wreak havokT-Rexes working as battering rams at the enemies gates while rockets fly at themauto-turrets spewing bullets at your Carno armySabretooths leaping over walls. It is a beauty to behold.nothing else. Theyll keep you from taming dinos by killing them mid proccessblock caverns so only they can harvest the resourcesliterally kidnap you to use you as a blood bag Mad Max style and so on.after all theyre just being preayed upontheyre not participating in all the fun that is Tribe Wars. But the only way to Tribe Wars be so much fun is allowing all this kind of freedom the game has right nowthey gotta allow people to be complete a-holes because during wars thats what you gotta be. If they put too many safety nets to keep people who wanna do PvP only when THEY wanna do PvP the game would be boring and stale.dont be. First of all because you dont really need PvP for this game to be fun. Theres a TON of stuff to do in PvE servers or offline if you just wanna do everything at your pace. I got a bit tired of all the pressure on PvP servers and have been playing in a PvE for around 60 hours right now. And I still only got only a Wood base with some Dinosjust hit level 45and I feel like Ill never run out of things to do because the devs just keep adding and adding stuff almost each day. People are also very helpful on PvE serverstheyll give you a hand when you have problems with a Rexhelp you gather Prime meat when youre taming a Carnivoregive you tips and materials. At least on my server I got absolutely nothing to complain about them.REJOICE! Because theyll soon add War Declaration to PvE serversso tribes can actually go at war when they feel like itwithout all the griefing to new players who want just to keep to themselves.Id like to congratulate the Devs. Theyre doing a terrific job. Optimization is alreayd a LOT betterstill not there yetbut much better. The content is fantastic and it just keeps coming. Bugs are rarer and rarerin fact I dont even remember the last time I experienced one.and its also pretty cheap.[H1]THIS IS A DAY 1 REVIEW AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS THE DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES[/H1]objectivesetc)some do not.)they will own your butt unless you hit a hill or something. Not really a Contheyre just d*cks)but please keep in mind that this is a VERY Early Access game despite the fact that there is a lot about it that simply looksand somewhat feelspolished (the dinosaurs are amazing). If you cannot or do not want to deal with the current CONS then you should wait at least a week and come back and check out the changes the Devs push otherwise Im saying go ahead and drop the 24.89$USD and try your hand at playing.[h1]â”œProfessors Reviewâ”¤[/h1]to rocket launchersand turretskilling you upon spawnBut rememeber that the game is still in [b]ALPHA STAGES[/b]. It still has a ways to go before it finishedbut it is headed in the right direction. It gets your heart pumping when you have a lot to loseand you got a giant dinosaur chasing you down through a forest.consider giving it a thumbs up!)[/i]and they think they are bringing some sort of new information to everyone by saying it.you can tell its not fake.First review i wrote for a game but it had to be done!A nearby chinese tribe gave us some stuff to start out and we were hooked to the game pretty much instantly. There were some big tribe wars going on on the server but we were left alone.carrying heavy loadstransportationcombatyou name it) and we eventually also tamed a few t-rexes and the stronger end game dinos. You name them all and because of their different tasks and stat builds you become sort of attached to your dinos as well which makes the game even better.Destroyed us.arrows and food and approached their base. The chinese built a enormous stone castle on the water where they stored most of their Egg farm dinos in. I went to the beach. swam underneath the base. found a spot where i could hack away at their stone walls to get inside. Found a good spot and made a start. tribe members brought over grenades and we blew though the wall. Out came charging a T-rex and 5 raptors at insane speed. we started backing off while firing at them. The water slowed them down. Called for the rest of the tribe to head over. we ended up fighting them on foot with primitive weapons. After a long fight we took them out one by one and eventually they all lay dead. That feeling of Vengeance is undescribable. but we werent satisfied. We headed back into the dino pen and laid waste to their entire egg farmwe killed over 20 Stegos three mammoths and a few ankylosIt was a massacre. Fueled by the loss of our pets and friends.After a few hours playing i just felt i had to type down something about the game. First off the game looks realy niceno way i could say it was a early access game if i didnt know it alrdy. No major game breaking buggs so farsome bigger dinos stuck between trees but so far i just seen a handfull of them.i legged back to the beach where i woke up.fish should be easy food to catchI swam out to a big boulder just where the sea got alittle deeperspotting a fish getting rdy to jump into the water and spearing it i saw a big shadow comming closer.... a shark the size of 2 cars....My dino i came to call Fido was defending me and the house without mercy. Oneday i felt the gound shake as a pack of big herbivores deciced that my house was totaly in the wrong place and started to attack it. Fido the good guard dog as he was attacked without delay. Outnumberd and outpowerd we fought them side by side for almost 30 min killing off 6 of the 8 attackers when Fido didnt have anymore fight in him and fell to the ground to never raise again. I without any backup was no match for the remaining two and i had to fall back into my house and gather as mutch of my resources i could carry and the flee. The only thing i could do was to watch from afar with my spyglass the destruction of my house and mourn the death of my brave Fido.This is a review of the offline game.we ran around killing everything. After about 30 mins of running and killing things I decided to go home and give my new buddy a rest. We ran through the night and in the morning i realised how extra lost i was and got worried. I decided that the best way to find my way home was to climb a mountain and look around. After 5 mins or so of looking and referencing the map I finally figured out where we were. Just as I was about to put my map away I was ambushed by several scorpions and unfortunately they killed me.Ark is easily my favorite game Ive every played. It goes so deep. The gameplay is super fun but also unfair at times. You are weak at first and dinosaurs are strong and merciless. Expect to die (you dont really lose anything when you die as long as you go and get your stuffthough your tamed dinosaurs die permanently).I couldnt recommend this game more!the official servers seem depressing because you constantly get raided by other players. Our personal server is hosted on Nitrado. Nitrados service totally stinks to set upbut works great after its up and running. We adjusted the settings to make breeding go faster and animals eat lessbut other than that we basically play vanilla Ark with the two of us in our own world.I loved co-playing Minecraft and Diablo 3.I have over 500 hours into the gamecompared to a lot of ARK players im still a noobso if you arent ready to turn this into a full time jobdont even bother thinking about getting this game. Ill explain why this game is a full time job later onbut basically it punishes any player that cant or wont play it 24/7.the biggest and in my opinion the coolest of the three maps. The beginning is the hardest part for new players. Every dino you meet can easily kill a noobeven the spitter dinos. It can be annoying running around naked and getting killed by raptorsbut stick with it and find your friends and build a safe place. Once you get the base builtthe game gets so much more fun. Every new dino you find is cooland it so fun the first time you get all your friends together and explore a cave. The most dangerous foes we encountered in PvE were the alpha predators. Our base got destroyed multiple times by alpha raptorsbut it was fun because it showed us that even though we had a big base with spike walls and guard towersthere was still a threat out there that had to be beaten. Of course once you build a metal base nothing can break it anymoreand once you tame flying mounts you dont have to worry about dangerous expeditions so late game it got boring. We basically got to the point that nothing PvE had to throw at us outside of boss battles was a challengeand even fighting bosses had no point because what would we use the tek gear to kill? Harder versions of that boss? Thats why we decided to turn to PvP to see if that was better late game.dont PvP. This game is designed in such a way that the big tribes that are on top stay on top. New tribes and new players just get pooped on in every single way unless they join an alpha and become a resource harvesting slave. Lets walk through all the reason PvP is horrible.they wont let anyone else even enjoy the game.you dont get a basethey might let you live in a thatch hut. Refer to reason 1.)you dont get to tame dinosthey might let you tame dodos. Refer to reason 1.)you dont get to upgrade any of your gear. Alphas block all loot drops (the good ones anyway) and fill all the caves with auto-turrets to gun down anyone that tries to explore them.and you wont get close enough to plant c4. You wont be able to bring dinos to tank the turrets eitherrefer to 1.)you dont get to save any of your dinosyou dont even get to fight backits all just gone. This happens all the timeand honestly offline-raid protection should be baseline on all servers.sleep or work or whateverthen they will know and they will raid you. They can even get text alerts that tell them the second you have logged off or onor if anything else unusual is going on on ""their"" server. Basicallythis site and sites like it are cancer. Alsoit doesnt tell them your in game namebut your steam namethat means even if you make another character they will know its you. Alsoif you piss them off and try to go to another serverthey can just look up where you went using Battlemetrics and come find you. There is no hiding and no escapeso you have to be nice and cant even PvP or else some loser with no life is going to come and find you on every single server you go to. If you run into anyone named ""123"" and a private profileBEWARE!each hatched dino is gonna be 2x the level of anything a noob will have.if the fact that they have 2-3x better dinos by building huge breeding rooms wasnt a big enough edgenow they get tek gear too. If they come at you with anything tek and you have baseline gear and baseline dinosyou are DEAD!and you must grind harder than everyone else to make sure you have the defenses and dinos to stop raiders. Dont botheryou wont.Im tired of typing this reviewjust know that if you enjoy PvP because you enjoy winning through skillthen dont PvP. No PvP skill is required at this pointtheir gear will have much higher armor and damagetheir dinos will have much higher hp and damagejust accept your death and wipe multiple times because you will lose everything and you wont even be online to defend itnot like youd have a chance even if you were.but now that it is I feel like I should address all the kids telling me I suck and that Im still a noob who doesnt know what hes talking about.this is NOT a skill based game. This is a grind basedoffline raid basedexploit based game. You cant come here and say Im a noobespecially when Ive played the game solo and as a small tribe for over 300 hoursand I joined an alpha tribe for a week or two so I know how it goes on a larger scale. My opinion actually got even worse after joining the alpha tribe because I realized just how bad the game panders to them. Here are some more reasons why I will never recommend this game to anyone that I found from my time with the alphas.you would probably expect this. After allthey have more players so it is only natural that they could send 5 out to grind while your tribe could only spare 1. Nonumbers isnt even what Im talking about hereIm talking about EXPLOITS with a farming dino and a Quetzal. A noob with a hatchet can get 50-60 wood from a single tree. An alpha tribe can get 1500 wood from a single tree. A noob with a pickaxe can get 50-60 metal from a veinan alpha tribe can get 300 metal from a vein. A noob would take hours to farm 1-2k metalan alpha tribe can farm 20-30k metal in an hour. The list goes on and every single resource you can think of they can get insane amounts much faster and easier. Nownoobs wont know how to do thisand wouldnt be able to because Quetzals are hard to tameand hard to hide from alpha tribes. If they saw you flying around harvestingthey would bring a Wyvern after you and start looking for your base.but if you get more than 20 players in a serverthe lag becomes unbearable. Once againalpha tribes exploit this by logging as many people as they can onto a server (kind of like DDOS) to block out defenders from connectingor to force the server to get so laggy that you can basically avoid taking damage from things.Im at a point where Im about to hit 20 solid hours of gaming and feel I have a good enough grasp of the game to review it. So here goes...GoGetc.this is an Early Access title. So of course the launch was plagued with issuesand the server numbers didnt cover the 100000+ players... BUTthe devs have made some of the most aggressive moves to resolve the issues that Ive ever seen.thats HUGE. A developer that actually TRIES to set the example and improve on their product. You just dont see this type of response at all from an indieor AAA team.with dinosaurs. Only the quality of the game is far superior being on the Unreal 4 engine. The fps numbers may be pretty low for most users but chock that up to poor optimization (which is expected of an Early Access title only a few days into release).you cant go wrong picking this title up at this point. Just make sure your system requirements meet the recommended and you should be fine.I absolutely love this game.  It encompasses all that I can expect of a survival game.  check out my hours and you will know how much I love this game. I recently experienced the tek cave and the overseer and that was amazing!   Im  62 years old and so farI plan on playing this game till I am no longer able to do so and then ascend to the great Ark in the Sky!  Of courseI would highly recommend this game to anyone that is not afraid to play the most awesome game ever!After many have triedStudio Wildcards and associate dev-studios are trying to finally deliver us what we have all been craving for: A survival game with dinosaurs! ARK: Survival Evolved is pretty much exactly thatwith an added twist of some unexplained sci-fi elements that all tie surprisingly well into the game. But is this Early Access title worth your money and time? Can we trust anyone after the Stomping Lands disaster?stranded on the eponymous ARKthe island the game takes place on. You do get the option to customise your characteralthough like in many other gamesanything but the smack center for most sliders ends up looking ridiculous (hugely muscledgiraffe-necked dwarf or super tallonyx-skinned valkyrie?)but it is still nice to have the option to go down that path. It should be noted at this point that your characters will be server-specificmeaning you can have one on every server.true to the survival-game code. You will quickly learn the ways of a hunter-gathereras your first task will usually be picking berries and collecting stones. You can also punch trees to get woodbut doing so will damage you (a dig at Minecraft? I like to think so.).the world of ARK does not try to hide its inhabitants from you. Hugeprehistoric beasts roam free over most of the map and there is rarely ever a moment during which you cannot see at least one dinosaur from your location. Not all of these creatures are trying to kill youhoweversome just try to live their life in peace. They may even fight each otheras the predators hunt for prey and the latter defends itself.in the sea and even the air. To help the players deal with these threats and offer some sense of progression at the same timeARK features a levelling-system. You gain XP at a steady rate over timewith a bonus for doing pretty much anything from gathering and killing to crafting and building. Levelling up will allow you to increase one of your attributesas well as spend points learning a new crafting-blueprint. While you are barely able to craft torches and stone tools at the beginning of your adventurelater down the line you may pick up the recipes for weaponsbuildings and more tools to help you survive. All blueprints cannot be unlocked until a very high levelso specialising in a select few while working together with other players online can be a huge benefit.for most playersis to build a somewhat self-sufficient base for yourself and your tribe. Bases are built using a very simple and easy to understand system of square foundations with snapping walls on their four sides and flat roofs on top. Indeedwhoever has played Rust will immediately feel at homeas the whole game plays very much like it. This includes players characters falling asleep and remaining in the world whenever their pupeteer disconnectsadding additional treat to potential raiderswho will be able to take all of your characters belongings even when you are not on the server. Of coursebuilding a secure base will help combat this threat.its general artstyle (sci-fi-looking HUD and inventory/character screen)its graphics (looking seriously impressive) and the fact that you can tame your very own dinos! Instead of killing the giant murder-machines (or players)you can choose to knock them unconscious insteadbeginning a rather lengthy taming-process during which you must keep the creature subdued while also feeding it its favoured food. Eventuallyit will become your (and your tribes) companionable to aid you in combatbear your burdens and even be ridden as a personal mount (works with flying dinostoo!). What more needs to be saidreally.the game has had a rather shaky launch into Early Access. According to the devsthey did not expect such a large resonance initiallywhich caused most official servers to crack under the pressure and lag. Alsothe stunning graphics of ARK come at a price: Your hardware will suffer. At this point in timeyou need a fairly beefy machine to be able to play ARK at a reasonable framerate. The devs are aware of this and are currently working on optimising the game to maximise FPS and minimise lag.really and is in no way reason to give ARK a negative review. In factthe devs claim one of the reasons for the current performance-issues to be their initial focus on contentwanting to give players enough things to do ingame for Early Accesswhich I think speaks volumes about the good intentions behind this project.even for Early Access ARK offers a great deal of content and longevity through its progression-system and dinotaming-mechanicswith so much more planned for the future. The performance-issues are being tackled at the time of me writing this review and some first patches have already been rolled outresulting in some great improvements for a lot of the players. I am very much looking forward to see more stuff added to ARK: Survival Evolved and I believe the very pleasant developers have the right ideas on how to steer it to success.By now youve probably read enough reviews both positive and negative and still cant decide.then you know a lot of the fun is learning new recipes and exploring and yearning to reach that next tier. At x4 xp ratesbefore you finish building your first house youre ready to build a tier 2by the time you finish upgrading the whole house to tier 2youre ready for tier 3. The game developers did a good job of making all the dinos good and useful. However someare only really useful at low levels. If you level too fast youll never have the joy of that first raptor or parasaur and the upgrade it gives you. Not only thatthey added in explorer notes which give you huge xp boosts. So its best to save them for laterespecially since you might have a dino you want to level.such as baby growth rate and egg incubation rates.every ten levels you can increase the rate by 0.1 so at lvl 100 the rate is 1.0. This should give you a game experience of leveling at a consistent rate.everything is replaceable. Remember the #1 rule of Arkuistion: The Ark giveth and the Ark taketh away. After a thousand hoursyoull still die a lotbut at that point youll know why! Just remember when you dieinstead of blaming the game or imaginary bugsthink about what you could have done to prevent it.trikeor anklyo when you first have access. Now while you can spend a lot of work to do thatits a lot of work you lose when the dino dies. And they always diesee rule #1. Many utlity dinos have their functionality at lvl 1so you can easily tame a lvl 1 dino and get a lot of use. For example it can take a hour to harvest enough berries by hand to tame a high level trikebut like ten minutes to get enough to tame a lvl 4 trikeand that level 4 trike can harvest hundreds of berries in ten minutes. A level 4 quetzl can be equipped with a platform saddle that can make taming a max level one even easier than taming the first level 4 one.I suggest you instead increase food consumption rates. I put my consumption rates at x3that way feeding my dinos is actually something I have to think about (x1 means feeding dinos is pretty meaningless)it also means kibble is important. If you increase taming rates you will end up making kibble meaningless which means youve eliminated an aspect of the game.I suggest getting a private server. Between the two of youyou can get every engram (recipe) pretty easily.  You should be able to accomplish anything as a duo. After 2k hoursyou can easily solo stuff with enough planning.be emotionally prepared to lose it (I dont use dinos I care about until Ive made a back up egg). (ii) Dont double down unless youre ready for the loss. All that gear you lost when you died is replaceablesure you can try to go back and get it but now youre doing so with less gear (I keep an emergency cabinet with the right amount of armor and supplies to do recovery runs)be prepared to lost that gear-but over time you WILL get better at recovering items. (iii) Fear the swampfear the cavesfear the snow biome- thats flavor country. Remember rule of Arkuisition #3: everything is disposable: your gearyour dinoyour houseyour life; refer to rule #1. (iv) You will lose some dinos you are trying to tame. A raptors favorite food is tames. However you can hedge your bets and avoid getting Arked if you wall off your tame with spiked wallsclear the areayou can even clear trees to increase your line of sight. Be paranoid and watch the skies for Argentavis who might like a nip at sleeping beauty.This game has taken my life. I feed my dinos more than my own kids. My wife has left megotta remove her from the tribe. Honestly 10/10 would get divorced again.tl;dr â€” worth itloved itbut Im not very hardcore. 300 hours on record100+ of those with my kids.STORYTIME:and edit The Island to be a bit less deadly and a bit more generouswent all in with my sons.and each other.training mobs of small dinosaursand then marching them into harms way.

1,"My wife & I enjoy this game together :) We love the co-operative clean fun & challenges :) She doesnt have a lot of mobility because of a rare disease so this is a way for us to get out - Thank youI bought two copiesone for my seven-year-old daughterand one for myself. I host a non-dedicated session and invite her through Steamand we spend hours tranquilizing dinosaurstaming themand collecting them on our island. I use the cheat codes to spawn all the items we want (using the ark wiki and double tab) and we have a great time. I recently purchased two copies of Scorched Earthand we spawned in tons of air conditioners and wyvern eggs to hatch baby dragonsthen we spawned in a bunch of wyvern milk to grow and tame them.as kids arent really the target demographicbut I thought Id give it a thumbs up anyways.This is a review of the offline game.we ran around killing everything. After about 30 mins of running and killing things I decided to go home and give my new buddy a rest. We ran through the night and in the morning i realized how extra lost i was and got worried. I decided that the best way to find my way home was to climb a mountain and look around. After 5 mins or so of looking and referencing the map I finally figured out where we were. Just as I was about to put my map away I was ambushed by several scorpions and unfortunately they killed me.Note: At least 1000 of my hours were spent on Official Servers. Thus my review will pertain to Official Servers.these people will either be total jerks and just kill you over and overor they will be really chilland youll form a tribe with them.  You will spend countless hours with these people: farming materialstaming dinosaursand build bases.  You will grow more and more in power.  You will be meeting other players either passing through the server or settling down.  You will know all the other tribes on the server that are worth knowing (i.e. the big tribes or friendly tribes).  You will come across numerous other cultures as you find Chinese tribes and Spanish tribesFrench and Germanall while growing more and more powerful.  You will on occassion have a set backbut at this point youre on a roll and now the games mechanicshave a good group of friendsand objectives that you have given yourself.  You will feel happy with what you have accomplished.while it can be delayed for long periods of timeit will eventually come.  And so another tribe will pick a fight with you.  Your tribe will fight their tribeand you may lose or you may win.  Either way youve invested a lot into this server and these friendsso youll never give up.  Some other tribes will jointhe fightpicking sides.  The winning side will probably kill all the dinostake all the matsand kill everyone on the losing side.  Thus you have won your first war.  You are now a power on the server worth being reckoned with.  Soon enoughyoull get in an even bigger war as the losing side draws more and more people to aide them and you respond by getting more as well.  Now the entire server is split 50-50and a great war mars the server for days as both sides are constantly wiping one anothers bases.  Eventually youll win thoughand the other side will leave the server.  Theyll be fed up.  As the enemies are now goneyou are happy once more.  You hated them just as they hated you.a couple weeks.  There is trouble brewing as a few of your allies are begin to grow wrestless and have infighting.  Peace will try to be maintained through talks.  But it will fail in the endand more war will arise.  This cycle will continue until only 2 tribes remain.  These two tribes will be dominant in every regard: leadershiptacticsdinosaursand materials.  Pitted against one another to see who will rule the server.  You will fight your heart out against your former allies.  You will destroy bases youd once entered as a friendnow as an enemy.  You will kill dinos whose names you helped come up with.  You and your tribemates will be cycling out who gets to sleep because the battle will last over 24 hours.  The fight will go on and on and on and on with no end.  It will be exhilerating.months ago when you were just a little tribe starting outwill all be gone.  Everyone youd ever fought with and fought against are gone.  While there is some joy in victoryit is very bitter as there is no one left to share it with.  Your tribemates will still playbut its not the same.  Even if not in your tribeyou had a community. Friends. Foes. Maybe even lovers.  Now all that is gone.  You will pass the ruins of these once great tribes and feel a hole in your heart.  New people will always arrive to challenge youbut youll always beat them down.  Destroying any hope they had.  Youll build fortresses thatll reach the Heavens and have so many dinos itll cause server lag.  Youll build Great Walls across vast territories in order to denote your power.  Finallyyoull get bored and leave.and one day youll see Ark still in your library and hop back on.  Youll log back into your old server.  Everything is different.  New namesfacesbaseseverything.  Not a single structure you had built is left standingnot a single ruin.  All of it is gone.  The people on this server see you log in and ask if you want to join their tribe saying that Ark can be harsh for noobsbut you could never tell them.  You could never tell them an entire servers history.  The hundreds of thousands of hours of work youd seen put in by that ancient world.  The structures they couldnt ever even imagine.  The wars youd fought and people youd met.  You could never explain to them what it all had meant to youfor it is all now gone.  In its place is a new worldcompletely distinct from the original while maintaining a strong similarity.  You will be both extremely happy at this new worldand profoundly sad about the world that was lost.no game will ever make you feel as strongly about the decisions youve made than Ark: Survival Evolved.  Beware that you may get addicted and lose your real social life and ambitions in exchange for this game.  But youll meet people youd never have met otherwisesee things you never thought possiblecommit acts that would make tyrants think youre true evil or saints believe you are the second coming of Jesus Christ.  In the endyoull feel stronger emotions then any youve ever felt from playing a game.Since most people are bashing the PvP servers for the griefingI feel like someone should answer that and also talk a bit about the PvE servers.about half of that on PvP servers and half of that on PvEall official ones. All the thing people say about the griefers is truetheyll kill your dinossteal your stuffabuse your body and destroy your house as soon as you go to sleep. In fact a lot of tribes organize group to play past midnight for the sole reason of hunting sleeping players. And thats the keyword here TRIBES. If youre playing on a PvP server you gotta keep in mind that youre not supposed to do it at your pace and take your time building your little Tatch hut with its little thatch fence with your Raptor and a couple of Dilos. Slowly learning the game by yourselftaking everything ineventually upgrading to Wood and then Stone and so forth.maybe even a weekbut alone youre doomed to be foundrobbed and killed. And like many others saidhave the work of a whole week go down the drain. If youre joining a PvP server youre doing it for Tribe warfare and let me assure youthing can get really intensereally epic pretty fast. With eagles swooping down to grab enemies and droping them from high altitues to their deathsor tactical droping Raptors inside their base to wreak havokT-Rexes working as battering rams at the enemies gates while rockets fly at themauto-turrets spewing bullets at your Carno armySabretooths leaping over walls. It is a beauty to behold.nothing else. Theyll keep you from taming dinos by killing them mid proccessblock caverns so only they can harvest the resourcesliterally kidnap you to use you as a blood bag Mad Max style and so on.after all theyre just being preayed upontheyre not participating in all the fun that is Tribe Wars. But the only way to Tribe Wars be so much fun is allowing all this kind of freedom the game has right nowthey gotta allow people to be complete a-holes because during wars thats what you gotta be. If they put too many safety nets to keep people who wanna do PvP only when THEY wanna do PvP the game would be boring and stale.dont be. First of all because you dont really need PvP for this game to be fun. Theres a TON of stuff to do in PvE servers or offline if you just wanna do everything at your pace. I got a bit tired of all the pressure on PvP servers and have been playing in a PvE for around 60 hours right now. And I still only got only a Wood base with some Dinosjust hit level 45and I feel like Ill never run out of things to do because the devs just keep adding and adding stuff almost each day. People are also very helpful on PvE serverstheyll give you a hand when you have problems with a Rexhelp you gather Prime meat when youre taming a Carnivoregive you tips and materials. At least on my server I got absolutely nothing to complain about them.REJOICE! Because theyll soon add War Declaration to PvE serversso tribes can actually go at war when they feel like itwithout all the griefing to new players who want just to keep to themselves.Id like to congratulate the Devs. Theyre doing a terrific job. Optimization is alreayd a LOT betterstill not there yetbut much better. The content is fantastic and it just keeps coming. Bugs are rarer and rarerin fact I dont even remember the last time I experienced one.and its also pretty cheap.[H1]THIS IS A DAY 1 REVIEW AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS THE DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES[/H1]objectivesetc)some do not.)they will own your butt unless you hit a hill or something. Not really a Contheyre just d*cks)but please keep in mind that this is a VERY Early Access game despite the fact that there is a lot about it that simply looksand somewhat feelspolished (the dinosaurs are amazing). If you cannot or do not want to deal with the current CONS then you should wait at least a week and come back and check out the changes the Devs push otherwise Im saying go ahead and drop the 24.89$USD and try your hand at playing.[h1]â”œProfessors Reviewâ”¤[/h1]to rocket launchersand turretskilling you upon spawnBut rememeber that the game is still in [b]ALPHA STAGES[/b]. It still has a ways to go before it finishedbut it is headed in the right direction. It gets your heart pumping when you have a lot to loseand you got a giant dinosaur chasing you down through a forest.consider giving it a thumbs up!)[/i]and they think they are bringing some sort of new information to everyone by saying it.you can tell its not fake.First review i wrote for a game but it had to be done!A nearby chinese tribe gave us some stuff to start out and we were hooked to the game pretty much instantly. There were some big tribe wars going on on the server but we were left alone.carrying heavy loadstransportationcombatyou name it) and we eventually also tamed a few t-rexes and the stronger end game dinos. You name them all and because of their different tasks and stat builds you become sort of attached to your dinos as well which makes the game even better.Destroyed us.arrows and food and approached their base. The chinese built a enormous stone castle on the water where they stored most of their Egg farm dinos in. I went to the beach. swam underneath the base. found a spot where i could hack away at their stone walls to get inside. Found a good spot and made a start. tribe members brought over grenades and we blew though the wall. Out came charging a T-rex and 5 raptors at insane speed. we started backing off while firing at them. The water slowed them down. Called for the rest of the tribe to head over. we ended up fighting them on foot with primitive weapons. After a long fight we took them out one by one and eventually they all lay dead. That feeling of Vengeance is undescribable. but we werent satisfied. We headed back into the dino pen and laid waste to their entire egg farmwe killed over 20 Stegos three mammoths and a few ankylosIt was a massacre. Fueled by the loss of our pets and friends.After a few hours playing i just felt i had to type down something about the game. First off the game looks realy niceno way i could say it was a early access game if i didnt know it alrdy. No major game breaking buggs so farsome bigger dinos stuck between trees but so far i just seen a handfull of them.i legged back to the beach where i woke up.fish should be easy food to catchI swam out to a big boulder just where the sea got alittle deeperspotting a fish getting rdy to jump into the water and spearing it i saw a big shadow comming closer.... a shark the size of 2 cars....My dino i came to call Fido was defending me and the house without mercy. Oneday i felt the gound shake as a pack of big herbivores deciced that my house was totaly in the wrong place and started to attack it. Fido the good guard dog as he was attacked without delay. Outnumberd and outpowerd we fought them side by side for almost 30 min killing off 6 of the 8 attackers when Fido didnt have anymore fight in him and fell to the ground to never raise again. I without any backup was no match for the remaining two and i had to fall back into my house and gather as mutch of my resources i could carry and the flee. The only thing i could do was to watch from afar with my spyglass the destruction of my house and mourn the death of my brave Fido.This is a review of the offline game.we ran around killing everything. After about 30 mins of running and killing things I decided to go home and give my new buddy a rest. We ran through the night and in the morning i realised how extra lost i was and got worried. I decided that the best way to find my way home was to climb a mountain and look around. After 5 mins or so of looking and referencing the map I finally figured out where we were. Just as I was about to put my map away I was ambushed by several scorpions and unfortunately they killed me.Ark is easily my favorite game Ive every played. It goes so deep. The gameplay is super fun but also unfair at times. You are weak at first and dinosaurs are strong and merciless. Expect to die (you dont really lose anything when you die as long as you go and get your stuffthough your tamed dinosaurs die permanently).I couldnt recommend this game more!the official servers seem depressing because you constantly get raided by other players. Our personal server is hosted on Nitrado. Nitrados service totally stinks to set upbut works great after its up and running. We adjusted the settings to make breeding go faster and animals eat lessbut other than that we basically play vanilla Ark with the two of us in our own world.I loved co-playing Minecraft and Diablo 3.I have over 500 hours into the gamecompared to a lot of ARK players im still a noobso if you arent ready to turn this into a full time jobdont even bother thinking about getting this game. Ill explain why this game is a full time job later onbut basically it punishes any player that cant or wont play it 24/7.the biggest and in my opinion the coolest of the three maps. The beginning is the hardest part for new players. Every dino you meet can easily kill a noobeven the spitter dinos. It can be annoying running around naked and getting killed by raptorsbut stick with it and find your friends and build a safe place. Once you get the base builtthe game gets so much more fun. Every new dino you find is cooland it so fun the first time you get all your friends together and explore a cave. The most dangerous foes we encountered in PvE were the alpha predators. Our base got destroyed multiple times by alpha raptorsbut it was fun because it showed us that even though we had a big base with spike walls and guard towersthere was still a threat out there that had to be beaten. Of course once you build a metal base nothing can break it anymoreand once you tame flying mounts you dont have to worry about dangerous expeditions so late game it got boring. We basically got to the point that nothing PvE had to throw at us outside of boss battles was a challengeand even fighting bosses had no point because what would we use the tek gear to kill? Harder versions of that boss? Thats why we decided to turn to PvP to see if that was better late game.dont PvP. This game is designed in such a way that the big tribes that are on top stay on top. New tribes and new players just get pooped on in every single way unless they join an alpha and become a resource harvesting slave. Lets walk through all the reason PvP is horrible.they wont let anyone else even enjoy the game.you dont get a basethey might let you live in a thatch hut. Refer to reason 1.)you dont get to tame dinosthey might let you tame dodos. Refer to reason 1.)you dont get to upgrade any of your gear. Alphas block all loot drops (the good ones anyway) and fill all the caves with auto-turrets to gun down anyone that tries to explore them.and you wont get close enough to plant c4. You wont be able to bring dinos to tank the turrets eitherrefer to 1.)you dont get to save any of your dinosyou dont even get to fight backits all just gone. This happens all the timeand honestly offline-raid protection should be baseline on all servers.sleep or work or whateverthen they will know and they will raid you. They can even get text alerts that tell them the second you have logged off or onor if anything else unusual is going on on ""their"" server. Basicallythis site and sites like it are cancer. Alsoit doesnt tell them your in game namebut your steam namethat means even if you make another character they will know its you. Alsoif you piss them off and try to go to another serverthey can just look up where you went using Battlemetrics and come find you. There is no hiding and no escapeso you have to be nice and cant even PvP or else some loser with no life is going to come and find you on every single server you go to. If you run into anyone named ""123"" and a private profileBEWARE!each hatched dino is gonna be 2x the level of anything a noob will have.if the fact that they have 2-3x better dinos by building huge breeding rooms wasnt a big enough edgenow they get tek gear too. If they come at you with anything tek and you have baseline gear and baseline dinosyou are DEAD!and you must grind harder than everyone else to make sure you have the defenses and dinos to stop raiders. Dont botheryou wont.Im tired of typing this reviewjust know that if you enjoy PvP because you enjoy winning through skillthen dont PvP. No PvP skill is required at this pointtheir gear will have much higher armor and damagetheir dinos will have much higher hp and damagejust accept your death and wipe multiple times because you will lose everything and you wont even be online to defend itnot like youd have a chance even if you were.but now that it is I feel like I should address all the kids telling me I suck and that Im still a noob who doesnt know what hes talking about.this is NOT a skill based game. This is a grind basedoffline raid basedexploit based game. You cant come here and say Im a noobespecially when Ive played the game solo and as a small tribe for over 300 hoursand I joined an alpha tribe for a week or two so I know how it goes on a larger scale. My opinion actually got even worse after joining the alpha tribe because I realized just how bad the game panders to them. Here are some more reasons why I will never recommend this game to anyone that I found from my time with the alphas.you would probably expect this. After allthey have more players so it is only natural that they could send 5 out to grind while your tribe could only spare 1. Nonumbers isnt even what Im talking about hereIm talking about EXPLOITS with a farming dino and a Quetzal. A noob with a hatchet can get 50-60 wood from a single tree. An alpha tribe can get 1500 wood from a single tree. A noob with a pickaxe can get 50-60 metal from a veinan alpha tribe can get 300 metal from a vein. A noob would take hours to farm 1-2k metalan alpha tribe can farm 20-30k metal in an hour. The list goes on and every single resource you can think of they can get insane amounts much faster and easier. Nownoobs wont know how to do thisand wouldnt be able to because Quetzals are hard to tameand hard to hide from alpha tribes. If they saw you flying around harvestingthey would bring a Wyvern after you and start looking for your base.but if you get more than 20 players in a serverthe lag becomes unbearable. Once againalpha tribes exploit this by logging as many people as they can onto a server (kind of like DDOS) to block out defenders from connectingor to force the server to get so laggy that you can basically avoid taking damage from things.Im at a point where Im about to hit 20 solid hours of gaming and feel I have a good enough grasp of the game to review it. So here goes...GoGetc.this is an Early Access title. So of course the launch was plagued with issuesand the server numbers didnt cover the 100000+ players... BUTthe devs have made some of the most aggressive moves to resolve the issues that Ive ever seen.thats HUGE. A developer that actually TRIES to set the example and improve on their product. You just dont see this type of response at all from an indieor AAA team.with dinosaurs. Only the quality of the game is far superior being on the Unreal 4 engine. The fps numbers may be pretty low for most users but chock that up to poor optimization (which is expected of an Early Access title only a few days into release).you cant go wrong picking this title up at this point. Just make sure your system requirements meet the recommended and you should be fine.I absolutely love this game.  It encompasses all that I can expect of a survival game.  check out my hours and you will know how much I love this game. I recently experienced the tek cave and the overseer and that was amazing!   Im  62 years old and so farI plan on playing this game till I am no longer able to do so and then ascend to the great Ark in the Sky!  Of courseI would highly recommend this game to anyone that is not afraid to play the most awesome game ever!After many have triedStudio Wildcards and associate dev-studios are trying to finally deliver us what we have all been craving for: A survival game with dinosaurs! ARK: Survival Evolved is pretty much exactly thatwith an added twist of some unexplained sci-fi elements that all tie surprisingly well into the game. But is this Early Access title worth your money and time? Can we trust anyone after the Stomping Lands disaster?stranded on the eponymous ARKthe island the game takes place on. You do get the option to customise your characteralthough like in many other gamesanything but the smack center for most sliders ends up looking ridiculous (hugely muscledgiraffe-necked dwarf or super tallonyx-skinned valkyrie?)but it is still nice to have the option to go down that path. It should be noted at this point that your characters will be server-specificmeaning you can have one on every server.true to the survival-game code. You will quickly learn the ways of a hunter-gathereras your first task will usually be picking berries and collecting stones. You can also punch trees to get woodbut doing so will damage you (a dig at Minecraft? I like to think so.).the world of ARK does not try to hide its inhabitants from you. Hugeprehistoric beasts roam free over most of the map and there is rarely ever a moment during which you cannot see at least one dinosaur from your location. Not all of these creatures are trying to kill youhoweversome just try to live their life in peace. They may even fight each otheras the predators hunt for prey and the latter defends itself.in the sea and even the air. To help the players deal with these threats and offer some sense of progression at the same timeARK features a levelling-system. You gain XP at a steady rate over timewith a bonus for doing pretty much anything from gathering and killing to crafting and building. Levelling up will allow you to increase one of your attributesas well as spend points learning a new crafting-blueprint. While you are barely able to craft torches and stone tools at the beginning of your adventurelater down the line you may pick up the recipes for weaponsbuildings and more tools to help you survive. All blueprints cannot be unlocked until a very high levelso specialising in a select few while working together with other players online can be a huge benefit.for most playersis to build a somewhat self-sufficient base for yourself and your tribe. Bases are built using a very simple and easy to understand system of square foundations with snapping walls on their four sides and flat roofs on top. Indeedwhoever has played Rust will immediately feel at homeas the whole game plays very much like it. This includes players characters falling asleep and remaining in the world whenever their pupeteer disconnectsadding additional treat to potential raiderswho will be able to take all of your characters belongings even when you are not on the server. Of coursebuilding a secure base will help combat this threat.its general artstyle (sci-fi-looking HUD and inventory/character screen)its graphics (looking seriously impressive) and the fact that you can tame your very own dinos! Instead of killing the giant murder-machines (or players)you can choose to knock them unconscious insteadbeginning a rather lengthy taming-process during which you must keep the creature subdued while also feeding it its favoured food. Eventuallyit will become your (and your tribes) companionable to aid you in combatbear your burdens and even be ridden as a personal mount (works with flying dinostoo!). What more needs to be saidreally.the game has had a rather shaky launch into Early Access. According to the devsthey did not expect such a large resonance initiallywhich caused most official servers to crack under the pressure and lag. Alsothe stunning graphics of ARK come at a price: Your hardware will suffer. At this point in timeyou need a fairly beefy machine to be able to play ARK at a reasonable framerate. The devs are aware of this and are currently working on optimising the game to maximise FPS and minimise lag.really and is in no way reason to give ARK a negative review. In factthe devs claim one of the reasons for the current performance-issues to be their initial focus on contentwanting to give players enough things to do ingame for Early Accesswhich I think speaks volumes about the good intentions behind this project.even for Early Access ARK offers a great deal of content and longevity through its progression-system and dinotaming-mechanicswith so much more planned for the future. The performance-issues are being tackled at the time of me writing this review and some first patches have already been rolled outresulting in some great improvements for a lot of the players. I am very much looking forward to see more stuff added to ARK: Survival Evolved and I believe the very pleasant developers have the right ideas on how to steer it to success.By now youve probably read enough reviews both positive and negative and still cant decide.then you know a lot of the fun is learning new recipes and exploring and yearning to reach that next tier. At x4 xp ratesbefore you finish building your first house youre ready to build a tier 2by the time you finish upgrading the whole house to tier 2youre ready for tier 3. The game developers did a good job of making all the dinos good and useful. However someare only really useful at low levels. If you level too fast youll never have the joy of that first raptor or parasaur and the upgrade it gives you. Not only thatthey added in explorer notes which give you huge xp boosts. So its best to save them for laterespecially since you might have a dino you want to level.such as baby growth rate and egg incubation rates.every ten levels you can increase the rate by 0.1 so at lvl 100 the rate is 1.0. This should give you a game experience of leveling at a consistent rate.everything is replaceable. Remember the #1 rule of Arkuistion: The Ark giveth and the Ark taketh away. After a thousand hoursyoull still die a lotbut at that point youll know why! Just remember when you dieinstead of blaming the game or imaginary bugsthink about what you could have done to prevent it.trikeor anklyo when you first have access. Now while you can spend a lot of work to do thatits a lot of work you lose when the dino dies. And they always diesee rule #1. Many utlity dinos have their functionality at lvl 1so you can easily tame a lvl 1 dino and get a lot of use. For example it can take a hour to harvest enough berries by hand to tame a high level trikebut like ten minutes to get enough to tame a lvl 4 trikeand that level 4 trike can harvest hundreds of berries in ten minutes. A level 4 quetzl can be equipped with a platform saddle that can make taming a max level one even easier than taming the first level 4 one.I suggest you instead increase food consumption rates. I put my consumption rates at x3that way feeding my dinos is actually something I have to think about (x1 means feeding dinos is pretty meaningless)it also means kibble is important. If you increase taming rates you will end up making kibble meaningless which means youve eliminated an aspect of the game.I suggest getting a private server. Between the two of youyou can get every engram (recipe) pretty easily.  You should be able to accomplish anything as a duo. After 2k hoursyou can easily solo stuff with enough planning.be emotionally prepared to lose it (I dont use dinos I care about until Ive made a back up egg). (ii) Dont double down unless youre ready for the loss. All that gear you lost when you died is replaceablesure you can try to go back and get it but now youre doing so with less gear (I keep an emergency cabinet with the right amount of armor and supplies to do recovery runs)be prepared to lost that gear-but over time you WILL get better at recovering items. (iii) Fear the swampfear the cavesfear the snow biome- thats flavor country. Remember rule of Arkuisition #3: everything is disposable: your gearyour dinoyour houseyour life; refer to rule #1. (iv) You will lose some dinos you are trying to tame. A raptors favorite food is tames. However you can hedge your bets and avoid getting Arked if you wall off your tame with spiked wallsclear the areayou can even clear trees to increase your line of sight. Be paranoid and watch the skies for Argentavis who might like a nip at sleeping beauty.This game has taken my life. I feed my dinos more than my own kids. My wife has left megotta remove her from the tribe. Honestly 10/10 would get divorced again.tl;dr â€” worth itloved itbut Im not very hardcore. 300 hours on record100+ of those with my kids.STORYTIME:and edit The Island to be a bit less deadly and a bit more generouswent all in with my sons.and each other.training mobs of small dinosaursand then marching them into harms way.

1,"Lookyou can just see how much I've played this game to know that I like it It's a good game with a great free trial you can play if you want to get a feel for it You've probably heard it all before from word of mouth so I'm not going to try and sell it for you here just know that it's really goodand maybe the most important: *If you buy the game on steam you can only buy the steam version of the expansion*there are two types of subscriptions: Entry and Standard subscriptions are differentstartingis 1499 USD This one has 8 charcters per sever with a total of 40 overall With a standard subscription you also have the option to purchase multiple months at a time This can save you money in the long run especially if you are really into the gamefor those who are used to WoW: You can play every classand every jobon one characteryou can play anything you want when you want to If a new class comes out you only have to be at the level the class requiresyou don't have to create a whole new character for it This was a big draw for me as swapping characters all the time was a real pain Yes there's still some grinding involved as you'll have to level up that class as well nowbut you don't have to always start from square one If anyone who used to play wow is reading thisname changes and race changes are also way cheaper from what I remember them being in WoW A name change is 10 USD on here and a Fantasiawhich is a way to completely makeover your character changingracegenderand nearly everything else save the nameis also 10 USD but can also be bought in packs of 3 or 5 that can save you some moneyoff the top of my headthat can help people new to the game If you're reading this I hope you have fun at least trying it outRegistering your account is the hardest quest so farSo I have bought this game on 05/25/17 and have been only playing this game till 06/04/2017 with an accumulate of 139 hoursChocobo and Chocobo racingis that in FFXIVthere is no rush in this game You can be what you want to be and you are not forced to do anything elsethere are Trials:Extreme which increases the difficulties making it twice as hardyou are in a party of 8 of what you do is important Everyone has to work together and synchronize too be able clear this content The amount of time varies but in the most extreme hardcore raiders it can take them a 5-7 days to clear but for normal players it can take them 2-3 weeks  There is also a 48 man savage content that released in the Eureka contentthere is always a new mechanic that is very unique This type of content take up to possibly more than 60+ hours Being it can take you more than 1-3 months just to clear 1 ultimate Though yes it's hard But that is what makes this so much fun The reward is that you will get a ultimate title and a unique ultimate weapon But it's worth itdungeons or crafting Every gear in this game unique There are people who actually farm gear just for glamour that just looks really cool too be being very gorgeous or just very funny4 Tanks3Healers7 Craftersand 3 Gathers Each job is very unique in terms of playstyle You can be good with a specific class But you will see a huge difference in terms of skill of the class you play too someone who plays the same class as you This means even though you know your class You haven't mastered it being there are rotationsif you do buy the steam versionyou can purchase subscription with steam credits But this is how the game is still alive and healthyFinal Fantasy 14 feels like the MMO that filled the void of my heart from what an MMO should beI feel like I can write at least a small review with 5 thousand hours in the game so here we gothe best mmo in my opinion out there Good musicdungeonsstory and awesome community Rocky start but starts to get better after the first expansionthe base game you get is easily the longest and grueling at times Quests that make you go fetch things from A to Btalk to this person etc Howeverit still has some good pointsHealer or DPS) Each training focuses on the general tasks your role does The rewards you get are gear that lasts until lvl 20 and a ring that grants you XP until lvl 25 or lvl 30the struggles of each nationhow the events prior to your arrival transpired and affected them along with some politicswith ARR donelet's give a look at what is to come Spoiler free of courseHeavenswardintroduces new things to the fray like mechanicslocations and it starts the addition of flying in each zone with whatever mount you want! Aside from those it features an engaging soundtrack that changes with each phase making the fights more fun and epic Worthy of the title you have been bestowed upon back in A Real Reborn What it also brings are 3 new classes: Dark KnightAstrologian and Machinist All three are accessible once you start the Heavensward expansion but start at a lower level than its entry levelespecially if you enjoy multitaskingHeavensward will leave you very satisfied with how the game evolved But it does not end thereStormblood! Like beforeit adds new mechanics and music along with two new areasboth having zones that you can enable flying in With it comes 2 new classes this timeboth DPSwhich some of you might laugh at because of its name Simple in gameplay but once you reach a higher level and learn its gimmicks you can see yourself dishing out large amounts of damagethe latest expansion Shadowbringers!sat at the edge of their seat and with their heart clenched I shall leave the reasons to you! Minor advice: Buckle up Things go to another level As beforenew zones with unlockable flyingthe player having 3 sets of combos: One for gathering ""Cartridges"" followed by a combo that uses a cartridge and another one that uses the 2nd combo Confused? So was I but it comes around A good description would be: Devil May Cry but tab target stylethe dancer swoops in with its buff by performing steps with their Dance Partnerincreasing both of their damage as the timer goes down At later levels you can buff the party members around yourselfalso increasing their damage With their Dance Partner they can buff and heal each other and those around themyes? Well that is because I have been saving words for this segment!Masayoshi Sokenhas a clear grasp on what to implement in this category so the player can enjoy doing the content From slow motifs to full on pieces in which make you question yourself if you are in a battle of life or death or at an opera/concert Many fall in love with the music in it and choose to do content because of it! Myself includedthe reason behind this big point that has been brought so many times is because we choose to be kind because the developers are also kind It's a paying forward sort of deal At least that is how I see itthank you for your time! I hope this review will be at least helpful in getting an image on how the game is like and if you want to try it Hope to see you lads and lasses in the game! And most importantlyhave an awesome day!Played WoW for 16 years or so Switched to FF finally been playing past couple days nonstop Dont regret a single minute of it Cant wait to start the actual expansions though Already recommended to all of my friends that play WoWI play MMOs It's my thing It's what I like to do I've tried many Most disappoint me This one did notas you can probably tell by my ever-increasing total playtimeto many people's annoyanceis [b]World of Warcraft[/b] (WoW) They are both 'theme park' style MMOsand they both use simpleaction-based'TAB-targeting' combat The similarities are vastI can assure youbut they are also obvious I can split hairstalk about WoW's reactivefast paced style versus FF14's slowprepared stylebut to anyone who has played both at the higher levelsit's fairly self-evident The games are very similar as massively multiplayer online role-playing gameswith simple mechanics and easy-to-enter natures (as well as raised cost-of-entries)I watched every cutsceneI leveled a healertank and a dps to 80 (the current max)and I gathered and crafted for way too longin that they are as helpful as they are awkward People will gladly help you for nothingthen ask that you visit them in their home (which is often just a hot tub next to a bed) They have odd customslike saying 'o7' at the start of dungeons (which is supposed to be a salute) Everyone cares how they lookbut doesn't care what you think about how they look Playing songs in the plazaserotic roleplay in the alleysand bots asking you to buy gil are common sightssplit by expansion You have to play through [b]all the present and past story[/b] to catch up This is [i]incredibly[/i] time consuming If you play like I did over the last yearit is unlikely you can get to Shadowbringers (the current expansion) within one month of game time Luckily[b]the free trial is extremely good now[/b] They recently changed it to be that you can play through the initial release content (A Realm Reborn)all for freeforeverit's painfully average The story is as well paced as paint dryingand because of the way item/level scaling worksthere is no meaningful challenges Grantedthere aren't [i]supposed[/i] to bebut it is disappointing The plot comes to a grinding halt a number of timesand sometimes there isn't even a plotjust you doing weirdforgettable jobs for weirdforgettable people If you tried this game and left because of how slow ARR isI can't blame you It's a slog But if you stick around[b]the last arc[/b] of ARR was relatively enjoyablefinally arriving at some of the crazy style Final Fantasy is more known for(and after you pay for the game)comes [b]Heavensward[/b] (HW)the Wrath of the Lich King of this game I cannot express to you how surprised I was by the sharp quality increase here It's remarkable The story picks up in a new kingdomdropping most of the old characters for a story about an oncoming dragon warset in a genuinely interesting nation The first time I truly took notice of the music in FF14 was when I entered this expansionit's phenomenaland consistently so throughout The quests become stripped of tedious 'Slay 10 _'and are paced very wellkeeping a feeling of tension as you progress that was never present in ARR If you've ever heard someone say 'stick around FF14it gets good'this is why Unfortunatelyit is followed bythen Stormblood is like Warlords of Draenor Everything I just praised HW for took several steps back during this story Old characters are brought to the light screaming and kickingsome given literal rewrites to force them to fit inand newer characters struggle to make an impact The music fails to keep me engaged as wellmatching equally uninteresting environments Plots are jump-startedthen the brakes are cut as they tumble down a hill While the questing is still better than ARRit's not by much anymore The truly cool moments are so few and far between a deepdeep ocean of truly unfulfilling questing It's really unfortunateI really liked a few of the characters they introduce hereand 2 of the zones they introduce are among the best the game haswith a small plot about a rebellion I truly enjoyed Those aspects are just mashed inside of a largermore boring plot about a different rebellion[b]Shadowbringers[/b] (ShB) was everything I hoped for If HW is WotLKand SB is WoDthan Shadowbringers isI guesskind of like Legion Honestlythe WoW expansion comparisons start to break down here If you are looking into this gameat some point you probably heard that Shadowbringers is good You probably also have some healthy skepticism and some tempered expectations I'm here to assure you that Shadowbringers is not so good that it's worth playing through all of what I just describedAND a $60+ price tag But it's pretty close This expansions reworks a lot of old characters and plots into a surprisingly touching and insightful storymaking one of the most trite and lifeless antagonistic forces in the game into strangely sympathetic villains The themes through the story are strongand conveyed in honestly intuitive ways [b]The music[/b] is unbelievably good One or two areas have some weaker themesbut the [url=https://wwwyoutubecom/watch?v=AG5qx583Uys]dungeons[/url] and raids have absolutely stunning scores The area designs are lackingin my opinionbut they are easy to traverseandwellit's very subjectiveorganized in no particular orderand the meta is tightwithand I know this is hard to believeevery class performing well It's very well balanced on the PvE sideand this is being generous[i]awful[/i] It's poorly balancedit's map design is shoddyand it's not very rewarding in terms of character progressionif at all It can be fun in short doses because it is chaoticbut playing it anymore than that is frustratingand there is a wide variety of styles to pursuealso known as the Mogstationis quite prevalent Not in the sense that you are forced to visit itor that you have to to get an advantagejust that manymany people use it Premium costumes and emotes are frequentas well as sales It doesn't bother me muchbut I mention it because it can be annoying to see someone wearing a cool setonly to discover it cost them $12slowand prone to problems The [b]customer support[/b] as well is slowbut I have found them to be at the very least helpful and patient AlsoI find Final Fantasy XIV a rewarding way to waste my time I often find myself just standing in placestalking with my friends and/or strangers I happen to meet in-game I recommend this to anyone who wants a relaxed MMO with a flair for the dramatic[h1] Sum up[/h1]even without the expansions Up to 2000 hours easilylooks appealing and raises the difficulty in later levelsbosses and raids look amazingfeaturing rich details and lots of effectsas well as other features to keep players together and make it easy to connectthough it gets much betterit becomes a trial and error experience when battling new bosses and exploring new dungeonsthat its system is easy to learn but hard to master and that it has a lot of versatility when it comes to its players It is a fluid system with a good amount of room to explore and take it easyonce they do they are able to queue up for dungeonstrials(bosses) and raids which they can battle together with friends or with other players through the party finderwhich works like a charmthen at lv 30that class will become a job Job is a more specialized class Depending on the class the player choosesgameplay will vary and while it would be impossible to mention all of them in a reviewI will give some examples Classes are divided into three roles:to a more offensive approach with the scholar who has damaging spells Players can also opt to get a mix of both with astrologianwhich depends on the high skill of the player and some RGN but features the higher arrange of abilitieswhich enjoy lots of damaging spells but lack utilityto bards who can buff their whole party with beneficial effects while keeping up damage or ninjaswho mix different kinds of abilities to generate powerful ninjutsuthey always must protect their fragile party members and be the shield that guards the realm of men Like their description saysthey keep everyone out of harm's way by provoking monsterrushing to deploy barriers or just being a pain for bosses to get rid of in general Tanks will redirect all the damage towards them so that the healers and dpsâ€™s can do their jobs without preoccupying about dyingand with the finderyou are always guaranteed to get a good balance of all of them Each of these roles is equally important as they are pieces of a greater whole The healers keep everyone alivethe DPS kills the enemies and the tanks keep the other two out of harm's way No matter which role you chooseyou will always be important for your partythere is another type of roles I havenâ€™t mentioned yet These are the disciples of the hand and the disciples of the hand In these fieldsplayers can find classes ranging from blacksmiths to fishermen or even culinarian! These jobs tend to break the normal pace of the game and offer a more relaxing environment They might sound boring at firstbut players often find themselves lost in them for hours Once you get goingyou just want to do moreand they are beneficial to yourself and your other classesfor exampleyou can make your own food which allows you to get bonus exp modifiers If you are a blacksmith or an armoreryou can craft your own weapons and armors to use in your other classes If you are a fishermanyou can sell the fish for lots of money on the player market and wellwho doesnâ€™t love fishing in a game?unfortunatelybut these are quite enjoyablefilled with lots of believable charactersconflictsdevelopment and moreso if you are not into spending a lot of time reading/watching cutscenesyou can always skip them and rewatch them later at an innâ€™s room There are also plenty of summaries only that are well written and consist of thirty to an hour reading material per expansion (game+2 expansions= 3 hours of reading total) so feel free to skip it if you do find it boring or exhausting to sit through Do however note that the story is one of the strongest points of the gamethis is not a big issue by any means Duties can be bothersome when you are at a party with friends but are overall enjoyable Probably the easiest MMO to get into has a UI that the player can adjust to fit their playstyle or needs and the game lacks any sort of pay to win or in-game advantage bought with real moneyonly shortcuts for those that simply donâ€™t have a lot of timefluent system with that is easy to use but hard to master By sharing all classes across one characterthe player will never need to go back to the start of the game in they decide that maybe that class they pickedin the beginningwasnâ€™t the one for themgetting devours by a Cerberus and fighting the beast from its stomach or even getting split from their bodies and have to move across a labyrinth of AOEâ€™s in order to go back into them and continue the fight There is always something new in waiting for the player in the next encounterit is filled with great amounts of content and different ice breakers to teach new players how to play and hold their hands until they can go by themselves into the wild worlds of Eorzea There are a bunch of side activities to break the normal pace of the game and have some fun if you are ever tired from questingand each dungeon or trial keep adding new mechanicskeeping the game entertaining and making you wonder what you will encounter in your next adventure I recommend this game to those that havenâ€™t experienced an MMOand to those that have as well[b] Alexander's Club Curations[/b] if you like and want to see more reviews like this one[/url][/quoteIt's important to know what this MMO is and isn'tgenerally speakingthere's only one ""right way"" to play a given class It [b]isn't[/b] some emergent life simulator where player actions directly influence some sprawlingcontinuous overworld Everything in the game is instancedarguably including the overworld which is broken up into several load zonesyou'll enjoy the game's great presentationmusicand writing Once you reach the endgamethe combat [i]finally[/i] meets its potential with harder content in the form of extreme trials and savage raids---{Graphics}---This game is really goodbut you dont have to take my word for itwanna play it?

If I make it that far and like itthen perhaps this may be worth buyingI wasn't quite prepared for how much I was about to be consumed by this game FF14 is easily the best MMO i've played since WoW's Wrath of the Lich King expansion more than 10 years ago I found it to be more enjoyable than EVE and Guild Wars 2and far superior to WoW's current expansion Battle for Azeroth After over a year of enduring that messit was refreshing to play FF14 and find an MMO that I actually could enjoy without excessive RNG and obnoxious busyworkso reviewing an MMO in its entirety is utterly mad and i'd be here for hoursso instead I'm going to try to highlight a few key pointsFF14 puts some serious investment into its storylines While it might officially be an MMOFF14 is also probably the largest JRPG ever made Expect dozens of hours of cutscenes and story eventswith me having about 300 hours played when I finished all current story content Now I didn't spend all 300 of those hours only doing story contentbut that should give you a pretty decent idea of how large the story is If you are familiar with this franchise then you have a pretty good idea of what to expectand longtime fans will see many familiar names among this game's characters and boss fights On the other hand the story is a bit mediocre early on and only really gets going in the first expansion Heavensward Technically you can skip all the cutscenes (and rewatch them in an Inn or your house)and even buy a skip all the way to Shadowbringers if you really want tobut I'd recommend against it considering how much of a role story and character development play in this game The story might be a bit bland and lengthy in its early stagesbut it becomes one of the better parts of this gameFF14 has a large number of different classesor ""jobs""that you can play as You get your typical MMO setup of tankshealersmeleeand ranged each with their own distinct play stylestrengthsand weaknesses Crafting and gathering in FF14 is much more developed than in most MMO's with each of them being different classes in their own right But unlike most MMO'sFF14 allows you to play all of these different classes on a single character This is a major selling point for someone like me with major alt problems in other MMO's (12 120's in WoWfor example) FF14 ensures that you are able to play all of the classes and their own storylines while at the same time not forcing you to build a new character from scratch for each different classthere are plenty of opportunities for PvE and PvP When it comes to PvPi'll admit that my experience is somewhat limited However from what I have seen of PvP in FF14 it is a bit clunkydoes not seem to be particularly popularand is one of the few areas where WoW clearly beats FF14 for now As for PvEFF14 is very strong indeed There are a large number of Dungeons (4 player runs)Trials (8 player boss fights)Raids (8 players)and Alliance Raids (24 players) FF14's version of LFGthe ""Duty Finder""is simple to use and allows you to queue up for any content you have unlocked - though you may want an organized group for the high difficulty content Worth mentioning are the ""roulettes"" which let you select a category (such as TrialsLevel 80 Dungeonsor Alliance Raids) to queue for and obtain a daily reward based upon your class level FF14 does have level scaling that reduces your level to fit whatever PvE content you find yourself inthough it is possible to turn this off for your own private groupsFF14 has a token/badge system where you collect currencies from doing 50+ PvE content that you can use to buy gearmaterialsand other goodies There is also nothing like the Titanforging or weekly chest RNG BS like what is in current (825) WoW Current content raids work a little differently in FF14 toowith you being limited in the amount of gear items you can get per week On the one hand this "
1,"Lookyou can just see how much I've played this game to know that I like it It's a good game with a great free trial you can play if you want to get a feel for it You've probably heard it all before from word of mouth so I'm not going to try and sell it for you here just know that it's really goodand maybe the most important: *If you buy the game on steam you can only buy the steam version of the expansion*there are two types of subscriptions: Entry and Standard subscriptions are differentstartingis 1499 USD This one has 8 charcters per sever with a total of 40 overall With a standard subscription you also have the option to purchase multiple months at a time This can save you money in the long run especially if you are really into the gamefor those who are used to WoW: You can play every classand every jobon one characteryou can play anything you want when you want to If a new class comes out you only have to be at the level the class requiresyou don't have to create a whole new character for it This was a big draw for me as swapping characters all the time was a real pain Yes there's still some grinding involved as you'll have to level up that class as well nowbut you don't have to always start from square one If anyone who used to play wow is reading thisname changes and race changes are also way cheaper from what I remember them being in WoW A name change is 10 USD on here and a Fantasiawhich is a way to completely makeover your character changingracegenderand nearly everything else save the nameis also 10 USD but can also be bought in packs of 3 or 5 that can save you some moneyoff the top of my headthat can help people new to the game If you're reading this I hope you have fun at least trying it outRegistering your account is the hardest quest so farSo I have bought this game on 05/25/17 and have been only playing this game till 06/04/2017 with an accumulate of 139 hoursChocobo and Chocobo racingis that in FFXIVthere is no rush in this game You can be what you want to be and you are not forced to do anything elsethere are Trials:Extreme which increases the difficulties making it twice as hardyou are in a party of 8 of what you do is important Everyone has to work together and synchronize too be able clear this content The amount of time varies but in the most extreme hardcore raiders it can take them a 5-7 days to clear but for normal players it can take them 2-3 weeks  There is also a 48 man savage content that released in the Eureka contentthere is always a new mechanic that is very unique This type of content take up to possibly more than 60+ hours Being it can take you more than 1-3 months just to clear 1 ultimate Though yes it's hard But that is what makes this so much fun The reward is that you will get a ultimate title and a unique ultimate weapon But it's worth itdungeons or crafting Every gear in this game unique There are people who actually farm gear just for glamour that just looks really cool too be being very gorgeous or just very funny4 Tanks3Healers7 Craftersand 3 Gathers Each job is very unique in terms of playstyle You can be good with a specific class But you will see a huge difference in terms of skill of the class you play too someone who plays the same class as you This means even though you know your class You haven't mastered it being there are rotationsif you do buy the steam versionyou can purchase subscription with steam credits But this is how the game is still alive and healthyFinal Fantasy 14 feels like the MMO that filled the void of my heart from what an MMO should beI feel like I can write at least a small review with 5 thousand hours in the game so here we gothe best mmo in my opinion out there Good musicdungeonsstory and awesome community Rocky start but starts to get better after the first expansionthe base game you get is easily the longest and grueling at times Quests that make you go fetch things from A to Btalk to this person etc Howeverit still has some good pointsHealer or DPS) Each training focuses on the general tasks your role does The rewards you get are gear that lasts until lvl 20 and a ring that grants you XP until lvl 25 or lvl 30the struggles of each nationhow the events prior to your arrival transpired and affected them along with some politicswith ARR donelet's give a look at what is to come Spoiler free of courseHeavenswardintroduces new things to the fray like mechanicslocations and it starts the addition of flying in each zone with whatever mount you want! Aside from those it features an engaging soundtrack that changes with each phase making the fights more fun and epic Worthy of the title you have been bestowed upon back in A Real Reborn What it also brings are 3 new classes: Dark KnightAstrologian and Machinist All three are accessible once you start the Heavensward expansion but start at a lower level than its entry levelespecially if you enjoy multitaskingHeavensward will leave you very satisfied with how the game evolved But it does not end thereStormblood! Like beforeit adds new mechanics and music along with two new areasboth having zones that you can enable flying in With it comes 2 new classes this timeboth DPSwhich some of you might laugh at because of its name Simple in gameplay but once you reach a higher level and learn its gimmicks you can see yourself dishing out large amounts of damagethe latest expansion Shadowbringers!sat at the edge of their seat and with their heart clenched I shall leave the reasons to you! Minor advice: Buckle up Things go to another level As beforenew zones with unlockable flyingthe player having 3 sets of combos: One for gathering ""Cartridges"" followed by a combo that uses a cartridge and another one that uses the 2nd combo Confused? So was I but it comes around A good description would be: Devil May Cry but tab target stylethe dancer swoops in with its buff by performing steps with their Dance Partnerincreasing both of their damage as the timer goes down At later levels you can buff the party members around yourselfalso increasing their damage With their Dance Partner they can buff and heal each other and those around themyes? Well that is because I have been saving words for this segment!Masayoshi Sokenhas a clear grasp on what to implement in this category so the player can enjoy doing the content From slow motifs to full on pieces in which make you question yourself if you are in a battle of life or death or at an opera/concert Many fall in love with the music in it and choose to do content because of it! Myself includedthe reason behind this big point that has been brought so many times is because we choose to be kind because the developers are also kind It's a paying forward sort of deal At least that is how I see itthank you for your time! I hope this review will be at least helpful in getting an image on how the game is like and if you want to try it Hope to see you lads and lasses in the game! And most importantlyhave an awesome day!Played WoW for 16 years or so Switched to FF finally been playing past couple days nonstop Dont regret a single minute of it Cant wait to start the actual expansions though Already recommended to all of my friends that play WoWI play MMOs It's my thing It's what I like to do I've tried many Most disappoint me This one did notas you can probably tell by my ever-increasing total playtimeto many people's annoyanceis [b]World of Warcraft[/b] (WoW) They are both 'theme park' style MMOsand they both use simpleaction-based'TAB-targeting' combat The similarities are vastI can assure youbut they are also obvious I can split hairstalk about WoW's reactivefast paced style versus FF14's slowprepared stylebut to anyone who has played both at the higher levelsit's fairly self-evident The games are very similar as massively multiplayer online role-playing gameswith simple mechanics and easy-to-enter natures (as well as raised cost-of-entries)I watched every cutsceneI leveled a healertank and a dps to 80 (the current max)and I gathered and crafted for way too longin that they are as helpful as they are awkward People will gladly help you for nothingthen ask that you visit them in their home (which is often just a hot tub next to a bed) They have odd customslike saying 'o7' at the start of dungeons (which is supposed to be a salute) Everyone cares how they lookbut doesn't care what you think about how they look Playing songs in the plazaserotic roleplay in the alleysand bots asking you to buy gil are common sightssplit by expansion You have to play through [b]all the present and past story[/b] to catch up This is [i]incredibly[/i] time consuming If you play like I did over the last yearit is unlikely you can get to Shadowbringers (the current expansion) within one month of game time Luckily[b]the free trial is extremely good now[/b] They recently changed it to be that you can play through the initial release content (A Realm Reborn)all for freeforeverit's painfully average The story is as well paced as paint dryingand because of the way item/level scaling worksthere is no meaningful challenges Grantedthere aren't [i]supposed[/i] to bebut it is disappointing The plot comes to a grinding halt a number of timesand sometimes there isn't even a plotjust you doing weirdforgettable jobs for weirdforgettable people If you tried this game and left because of how slow ARR isI can't blame you It's a slog But if you stick around[b]the last arc[/b] of ARR was relatively enjoyablefinally arriving at some of the crazy style Final Fantasy is more known for(and after you pay for the game)comes [b]Heavensward[/b] (HW)the Wrath of the Lich King of this game I cannot express to you how surprised I was by the sharp quality increase here It's remarkable The story picks up in a new kingdomdropping most of the old characters for a story about an oncoming dragon warset in a genuinely interesting nation The first time I truly took notice of the music in FF14 was when I entered this expansionit's phenomenaland consistently so throughout The quests become stripped of tedious 'Slay 10 _'and are paced very wellkeeping a feeling of tension as you progress that was never present in ARR If you've ever heard someone say 'stick around FF14it gets good'this is why Unfortunatelyit is followed bythen Stormblood is like Warlords of Draenor Everything I just praised HW for took several steps back during this story Old characters are brought to the light screaming and kickingsome given literal rewrites to force them to fit inand newer characters struggle to make an impact The music fails to keep me engaged as wellmatching equally uninteresting environments Plots are jump-startedthen the brakes are cut as they tumble down a hill While the questing is still better than ARRit's not by much anymore The truly cool moments are so few and far between a deepdeep ocean of truly unfulfilling questing It's really unfortunateI really liked a few of the characters they introduce hereand 2 of the zones they introduce are among the best the game haswith a small plot about a rebellion I truly enjoyed Those aspects are just mashed inside of a largermore boring plot about a different rebellion[b]Shadowbringers[/b] (ShB) was everything I hoped for If HW is WotLKand SB is WoDthan Shadowbringers isI guesskind of like Legion Honestlythe WoW expansion comparisons start to break down here If you are looking into this gameat some point you probably heard that Shadowbringers is good You probably also have some healthy skepticism and some tempered expectations I'm here to assure you that Shadowbringers is not so good that it's worth playing through all of what I just describedAND a $60+ price tag But it's pretty close This expansions reworks a lot of old characters and plots into a surprisingly touching and insightful storymaking one of the most trite and lifeless antagonistic forces in the game into strangely sympathetic villains The themes through the story are strongand conveyed in honestly intuitive ways [b]The music[/b] is unbelievably good One or two areas have some weaker themesbut the [url=https://wwwyoutubecom/watch?v=AG5qx583Uys]dungeons[/url] and raids have absolutely stunning scores The area designs are lackingin my opinionbut they are easy to traverseandwellit's very subjectiveorganized in no particular orderand the meta is tightwithand I know this is hard to believeevery class performing well It's very well balanced on the PvE sideand this is being generous[i]awful[/i] It's poorly balancedit's map design is shoddyand it's not very rewarding in terms of character progressionif at all It can be fun in short doses because it is chaoticbut playing it anymore than that is frustratingand there is a wide variety of styles to pursuealso known as the Mogstationis quite prevalent Not in the sense that you are forced to visit itor that you have to to get an advantagejust that manymany people use it Premium costumes and emotes are frequentas well as sales It doesn't bother me muchbut I mention it because it can be annoying to see someone wearing a cool setonly to discover it cost them $12slowand prone to problems The [b]customer support[/b] as well is slowbut I have found them to be at the very least helpful and patient AlsoI find Final Fantasy XIV a rewarding way to waste my time I often find myself just standing in placestalking with my friends and/or strangers I happen to meet in-game I recommend this to anyone who wants a relaxed MMO with a flair for the dramatic[h1] Sum up[/h1]even without the expansions Up to 2000 hours easilylooks appealing and raises the difficulty in later levelsbosses and raids look amazingfeaturing rich details and lots of effectsas well as other features to keep players together and make it easy to connectthough it gets much betterit becomes a trial and error experience when battling new bosses and exploring new dungeonsthat its system is easy to learn but hard to master and that it has a lot of versatility when it comes to its players It is a fluid system with a good amount of room to explore and take it easyonce they do they are able to queue up for dungeonstrials(bosses) and raids which they can battle together with friends or with other players through the party finderwhich works like a charmthen at lv 30that class will become a job Job is a more specialized class Depending on the class the player choosesgameplay will vary and while it would be impossible to mention all of them in a reviewI will give some examples Classes are divided into three roles:to a more offensive approach with the scholar who has damaging spells Players can also opt to get a mix of both with astrologianwhich depends on the high skill of the player and some RGN but features the higher arrange of abilitieswhich enjoy lots of damaging spells but lack utilityto bards who can buff their whole party with beneficial effects while keeping up damage or ninjaswho mix different kinds of abilities to generate powerful ninjutsuthey always must protect their fragile party members and be the shield that guards the realm of men Like their description saysthey keep everyone out of harm's way by provoking monsterrushing to deploy barriers or just being a pain for bosses to get rid of in general Tanks will redirect all the damage towards them so that the healers and dpsâ€™s can do their jobs without preoccupying about dyingand with the finderyou are always guaranteed to get a good balance of all of them Each of these roles is equally important as they are pieces of a greater whole The healers keep everyone alivethe DPS kills the enemies and the tanks keep the other two out of harm's way No matter which role you chooseyou will always be important for your partythere is another type of roles I havenâ€™t mentioned yet These are the disciples of the hand and the disciples of the hand In these fieldsplayers can find classes ranging from blacksmiths to fishermen or even culinarian! These jobs tend to break the normal pace of the game and offer a more relaxing environment They might sound boring at firstbut players often find themselves lost in them for hours Once you get goingyou just want to do moreand they are beneficial to yourself and your other classesfor exampleyou can make your own food which allows you to get bonus exp modifiers If you are a blacksmith or an armoreryou can craft your own weapons and armors to use in your other classes If you are a fishermanyou can sell the fish for lots of money on the player market and wellwho doesnâ€™t love fishing in a game?unfortunatelybut these are quite enjoyablefilled with lots of believable charactersconflictsdevelopment and moreso if you are not into spending a lot of time reading/watching cutscenesyou can always skip them and rewatch them later at an innâ€™s room There are also plenty of summaries only that are well written and consist of thirty to an hour reading material per expansion (game+2 expansions= 3 hours of reading total) so feel free to skip it if you do find it boring or exhausting to sit through Do however note that the story is one of the strongest points of the gamethis is not a big issue by any means Duties can be bothersome when you are at a party with friends but are overall enjoyable Probably the easiest MMO to get into has a UI that the player can adjust to fit their playstyle or needs and the game lacks any sort of pay to win or in-game advantage bought with real moneyonly shortcuts for those that simply donâ€™t have a lot of timefluent system with that is easy to use but hard to master By sharing all classes across one characterthe player will never need to go back to the start of the game in they decide that maybe that class they pickedin the beginningwasnâ€™t the one for themgetting devours by a Cerberus and fighting the beast from its stomach or even getting split from their bodies and have to move across a labyrinth of AOEâ€™s in order to go back into them and continue the fight There is always something new in waiting for the player in the next encounterit is filled with great amounts of content and different ice breakers to teach new players how to play and hold their hands until they can go by themselves into the wild worlds of Eorzea There are a bunch of side activities to break the normal pace of the game and have some fun if you are ever tired from questingand each dungeon or trial keep adding new mechanicskeeping the game entertaining and making you wonder what you will encounter in your next adventure I recommend this game to those that havenâ€™t experienced an MMOand to those that have as well[b] Alexander's Club Curations[/b] if you like and want to see more reviews like this one[/url][/quoteIt's important to know what this MMO is and isn'tgenerally speakingthere's only one ""right way"" to play a given class It [b]isn't[/b] some emergent life simulator where player actions directly influence some sprawlingcontinuous overworld Everything in the game is instancedarguably including the overworld which is broken up into several load zonesyou'll enjoy the game's great presentationmusicand writing Once you reach the endgamethe combat [i]finally[/i] meets its potential with harder content in the form of extreme trials and savage raids---{Graphics}---This game is really goodbut you dont have to take my word for itwanna play it?

If I make it that far and like itthen perhaps this may be worth buyingI wasn't quite prepared for how much I was about to be consumed by this game FF14 is easily the best MMO i've played since WoW's Wrath of the Lich King expansion more than 10 years ago I found it to be more enjoyable than EVE and Guild Wars 2and far superior to WoW's current expansion Battle for Azeroth After over a year of enduring that messit was refreshing to play FF14 and find an MMO that I actually could enjoy without excessive RNG and obnoxious busyworkso reviewing an MMO in its entirety is utterly mad and i'd be here for hoursso instead I'm going to try to highlight a few key pointsFF14 puts some serious investment into its storylines While it might officially be an MMOFF14 is also probably the largest JRPG ever made Expect dozens of hours of cutscenes and story eventswith me having about 300 hours played when I finished all current story content Now I didn't spend all 300 of those hours only doing story contentbut that should give you a pretty decent idea of how large the story is If you are familiar with this franchise then you have a pretty good idea of what to expectand longtime fans will see many familiar names among this game's characters and boss fights On the other hand the story is a bit mediocre early on and only really gets going in the first expansion Heavensward Technically you can skip all the cutscenes (and rewatch them in an Inn or your house)and even buy a skip all the way to Shadowbringers if you really want tobut I'd recommend against it considering how much of a role story and character development play in this game The story might be a bit bland and lengthy in its early stagesbut it becomes one of the better parts of this gameFF14 has a large number of different classesor ""jobs""that you can play as You get your typical MMO setup of tankshealersmeleeand ranged each with their own distinct play stylestrengthsand weaknesses Crafting and gathering in FF14 is much more developed than in most MMO's with each of them being different classes in their own right But unlike most MMO'sFF14 allows you to play all of these different classes on a single character This is a major selling point for someone like me with major alt problems in other MMO's (12 120's in WoWfor example) FF14 ensures that you are able to play all of the classes and their own storylines while at the same time not forcing you to build a new character from scratch for each different classthere are plenty of opportunities for PvE and PvP When it comes to PvPi'll admit that my experience is somewhat limited However from what I have seen of PvP in FF14 it is a bit clunkydoes not seem to be particularly popularand is one of the few areas where WoW clearly beats FF14 for now As for PvEFF14 is very strong indeed There are a large number of Dungeons (4 player runs)Trials (8 player boss fights)Raids (8 players)and Alliance Raids (24 players) FF14's version of LFGthe ""Duty Finder""is simple to use and allows you to queue up for any content you have unlocked - though you may want an organized group for the high difficulty content Worth mentioning are the ""roulettes"" which let you select a category (such as TrialsLevel 80 Dungeonsor Alliance Raids) to queue for and obtain a daily reward based upon your class level FF14 does have level scaling that reduces your level to fit whatever PvE content you find yourself inthough it is possible to turn this off for your own private groupsFF14 has a token/badge system where you collect currencies from doing 50+ PvE content that you can use to buy gearmaterialsand other goodies There is also nothing like the Titanforging or weekly chest RNG BS like what is in current (825) WoW Current content raids work a little differently in FF14 toowith you being limited in the amount of gear items you can get per week On the one hand this "
1,Terrariaâ€™s final major updateJourneyâ€™s End (1.4)is here. And itâ€™s great! Iâ€™ll explain to all of you why I recommend Terraria. You should get this game right now since the final update dropped. Iâ€™ll try to update my Steam review some more (posted May 52020; edited May 202020; May 282020; March 62021; and August 72021. Thanks for all the feedback! It's much appreciated).I would put it like this: Terraria is a game that has a whole world to explore. You minebuildcraftfishand fight to progress through the game. You can focus on fighting enemies and improving your gear to fight various bossesand/or you can focus on building your house and buildings and making things look pretty. Terraria has something for everyone. The combination of survivalfightingexplorationand building aspects is satisfying (and I'm someone who usually plays shooter games). So I believe that you can find something in Terraria for you.the building got so much more interesting and versatile. There are so many different types of blocks in this game with their own unique textures and stylesand with paint there are even more possibilities. Some of the creations made in this game are insanely good.Terraria on Classic (formerly known as Softcore) and Normal mode is not that hardbut just be aware that no matter whatyouâ€™ll probably die a lot as a beginner. If you like a challengehoweverExpert mode is the way to go (plus you get extra advantagessuch as exclusive accessoriesfor having an increased difficulty). Even more difficult is Master modegiving you even more loot than Expert mode. And if you want the game to be especially difficultyou could choose Mediumcore (drop all items on death)or Hardcore (permadeath) during character creation. There is also Journey modewhich is an adjustable difficulty semi-creative mode that requires a Journey exclusive character (canâ€™t go to NormalExpertor Master mode worlds). PersonallyI think Classic and Expert mode is the most fun way to play.and there are different songs for bosses and events as well. I bought the official soundtrack and I love to listen to it whenever I want some background music.whichbefore 1.3used to be the only way to play multiplayer at allbut now it's so much easier with Steam integration.although I think Iâ€™ve found that the host has worse lag than the other playerswhen there is lag that is.PVPand other multiplayer elements built into the game. Bosses are often much easier to beat in multiplayer as wellbecause usually if one player diesthe other player can continue to fight the boss and stay alive long enough to let the first player respawn.which is great for gamingthe game runs perfectly on max settings and has nearly instantaneous loading speeds. On my HP computerwhich is not built for gamingand on my 11-year-old Toshiba laptopthe game runs very nicely on low settingswith only minor loading times.howeverare left up to the player to figure outmuch of which is just learned through time and experience. I would recommend looking up tipstricksand other information onlinesuch as on the Official Terraria Wikior watch videoslike those of ChippyGaming and Edward on YouTube. PersonallyI enjoy the learning curveand the struggle to learn new things is just the right amount to be enjoyable and not annoying.it does take a while. There is so much content and so many bosses in just vanilla Terrariathat it can be overwhelmingand progression can sometimes feel slow. You may want to rush things like bossesbut you have to prepare well for bossesor else youâ€™ll probably die. I used to ragequit when I couldnâ€™t beat bossesand I still get frustrated if I canâ€™t beat a boss. Once you defeat bosseshoweverit feels so worth it. And you donâ€™t have to follow an exactly linear path either. Alsoyou donâ€™t have to play for 30+ hours for a full playthrough just to feel accomplished. From one to a million hoursthis game is fun for any length of time.due to low drop rates or pretty extreme circumstances. There are manymany items with a drop chance lower than 1%. Realisticallyyou wonâ€™t get every item in the gameif thatâ€™s what youâ€™re aiming for. I once wanted to get every enemy banner in the game (you have to kill 50 of the same enemy to get a banner) legitimatelybut I gave up on that idea because of how grindy it is to kill 50 of each enemy for the rarest ones (that darn Nymph Banner). To put it simplyitâ€™s possible to get every item in the gamebut itâ€™s just not worth it. You shouldhoweverbuild farms for certain items. But the point isjust get the items in the game that you really want to get legitimatelyand itâ€™ll be worth it (if you did want every single item in the gameyou can use inventory editors or go to free item serversbut itâ€™s not fun to abuse these).since theyâ€™re liquidproofwhich is perfect for building bridges. Smart cursor is extremely useful for this as wellwhich is activated using Ctrl (default)since the CorruptionCrimsonand the Hallow biomes spread across the worldand the Corruption/Crimson can destroy the Jungle biome over time and do other unfortunate thingsaccessoriesand other loot that enhance the game tremendously. Once you find the Angler NPC in the Ocean biome at either end of the worlduse him to get quests to find a specific fishwhich you can redeem for lootsince it can occasionally reset the room status as suitable or reset your spawnpoint. As of 1.4doors are much easier to deal with since they can auto open and closeuse an Alchemy Table from the Dungeon to have a 33% chance to not consume potion ingredientsand I've played through so much of the game's development back when there wasn't even a fraction of the number of items in the game. To put it simplyTerraria is my favorite game. So after over a 1000 hours of playtimeI can safely say that I 100% recommend buying and playing Terraria.I've never actually taken the time to write out a real review of a gamebut this one absolutely deserves it.only to later beg my parents to buy me a computer so that I could play the 1.2 update. After thatI spent hours grinding through the game. It was shortly after my first time completing the game during 1.2 that I played the game again with friends. Though not a memorable experience in of itselfit did pave the way for those friendships to evolve further.I would periodically revisit the game on my own and with my friends for years. Sometimes there would be modssometimes it would be the original experience. Regardless of how I playedI never ever got bored with the game. I may only have 1600 hours across 6 yearsbut each one of those hours was spent in the game having a blast and completing my saves for each character I played on.an update I have played through and throughI have finally managed to scrounge up the courage to say goodbye to this game. That doesn't mean that I'm going to stop playing itthat will never be a feasible option to meespecially with a game that has shaped my childhood. This review serves as a ode to an amazing game that has changed my lifeas well as a way for me to cope with the game no longer receiving updates.and I look forward to future endeavors.I've sunk 4500 hours into this masterpiece and have not regretted a single oneif you're looking for an awesome sandbox builder game mixed with epic bosses and worlds then this game is for you. ten stars out of fiveThe only bad thing about Terraria is that it ends.8 years of free updates and countingHonestlyI don't know why Terraria has so many haters. This game literally has everything. Fun to playtons of things to dobosses to killofc it has multiplayer so you can enjoy everything with friendsitems to farma lot of stuff and decorations to build withnot to mention that if you hit the bottom and feel like you have completed the gameyou can install some mods adding a crazy amount of new featuresitemsect ...  When you're ingame (and I don't really know how to explain it) there's just something very chilling about itmaybe it's the musicmaybe it's just every little detail about it. That's just how the game works. Perfect for chilling when you had a bad or exhausting daybut it's also the perfect entertainment for your free time. 10/10[h1] You feel an evil presence watching you... [/h1]only to one day wake up face down on your keyboard surrounded by bottles and plates wondering where the past 3 weeks went. 100 hours in and I've still not defeated the current 'final' bosssomething that's a mixture of the games' excellent difficulty curveand a melancholy realisation that once I defeat himmy time with the game will naturally come to an end.Terraria is a sandbox game. You appear in a new world with some basic equipment and no real instructioneventually you will build a small house to survive the monsters that surface during the nightdiscover some form of corruption eating away at the worldencounter new NPCs and face off against powerful Boss enemies. Despite all thisyou are given little directionthese are merely facets of a larger game that allows players to do as they wishencountering all the world has to offer at mostly their own pace. Part of the great design behind the title is in the difficulty curve I mentioned earliermeaning challenges pitted against a player start easy and steadily increase at a rate easy to handle. Although traditional RPG elements are largely absenta discrete levelling system is present in the form of Bosses that have been defeatedmeaning if you don't progress through these enemies then the gameplay doesn't become more difficult. In factthe first boss doesn't spawn until you're suitably equipped with armour and health.but in my opinion the game is much more rewarding gathering some friends and working together to tackle the bossesas the feeling of reaching new goals is sharedand the ammount of 'grinding' for materials is spread across multiple people. It also helps to appreciate the brilliant soundtrackas if you voice chat with your group then spontaneous humming along loudly is to be expected.with floating eyespossessed suits of armourgiant robotic wormsand a ninja suspended in a giant ball of slime all making appearances. That being saidwhoever on the design team is responsible for 'hellbats' has earned a special sort of hatred from myself...its tone is humourous at times whist still provoking a feeling of wonderment and mystery in its explorationand fearful excitement at its combat. It's a game I will come back to time and time again looking to recapture the memories I've madeand to forge new ones. It is a rare game in that with no shred of a doubtthese hours I have spent were not wasted. I heartily recommend that you purchase this game.After playing the game since 2011 I have just realized I have never left a review.and several times as a gift for others.with friendswith my girlfriend and planning to introduce it to my daughters (who were born since the game launched).foughtexploredcreated wild-life reservation worlds as well as apocalyptic wastelands...it's not that bad game after all.Sohere's a simplified list of what you'll find in Terraria:armorcosmeticsand building material. It's crazythat fit the creative environments they pair with. Boss fight music gets you pumped!but once you work past it is where the game feels like it truly begins for me.or find people to run through the game withdo it. It's much more fun that way. You can still enjoy it quite a bit single playerhowever... it's not the same when you can't laugh when someone gets destroyed by a boulder trap.back when it was still in developmentbefore any of the expansions and cleanups it's gone through. I spent $10 on this.the Dev team (at least back in 2014-2015 or so when I kept up with it) would post threads about once a month at the least to let people know what was planned/ the progress of the game. It kept getting updatedadding more content and mechanics. I remember being super excited when new weapon types were addedrare mounts were added. Accessories so your character can fly around the map? Gimme. Something I always admire too is Re-Logic did not simply focus on adding more stuff end gamethey kept polishing up early game tooadding things like Ropes to make things easier until you get hookshotssimple versions of weapons you find later like Spearswooden yo-yomore early game magic items. It used to be a much less enjoyableslower grind to get to mid game content where the pace picks up.and I was satisfied with it then. I'd gotten more content and enjoyment out of Terraria than most games I'd bought for $30 or more. Yet somehowmaybe a year after hearing nothinga new content update would surprisingly be pushed out. This happened at least twicewhen I thought it would be laid to rest as is.Labor of love from this developer is unreal.and now here we are at The Journey's End update.Huge replay value / replayability.base buildingRPGor you are a creative person definitely recommend this game.10 years of active development0 DLC0 microtransactionsa consistent $10 price tag with consistent 50% markdowns during any and all major steam sales.lets talk about the game.gameplay varietylengthand sense of consistent progression. The game has one of the best communities of any game I have ever played. Not to mention modding is now supported on steam (see Tmodloader) and the modding community is actually CRACKED.For everyone saying this is a 2D Minecraftyou're wrong. This game has a lot of stuff to offer. Different kind of bossesunique itemsan adventure u WILL NEVER forgetTerraria.Its not 2D minecrafttrust meHow have I not written a review for this amazing game?in the Christmas season of 2011. Over these yearsI've logged just about 2000 hours totalalong with another 1000 hours played offline. Enough showing off though. Why in the world should you buy this game?you get to completely customize your character and world. After setting it all upyou get dropped into the center of the overworldwhere you can go off to do whatever you want. For those of you who got bored with Minecraft as I diddon't worryas Terraria completely fixes that problem with branching pathways in weapon classes and self-imposed challenges.cooperating with friends on an extremely easy to-set-up multiplayer server. By hosting directly through Steamyou just open up your world from the Multiplayer menuand send an invite to your friend(s)! It's that easy! No need for messy port-forwarding or separate third party accounts!there are tons of really great mods to check out! Thorium and Calamity are 2 of the biggest ones out there. Thorium blends and balances perfectly with the base game's progressionwhile Calamity adds some incredibly difficult boss battles and other challenges in higher levels than the progression of the base game (or so I've heard... I'm still blind to most of it). Separatelythose 2 add so much on their ownbut there are so many others that can change so many things about the game. Possibilities are endless when it comes to modding in Terraria.the music is absolutely outstandingand along with the ambient noisesthe game has an amazing sense of atmosphere. Evil places feel like they're filled with dark energy and horrible power. Underground caverns are filled with anxiety of incoming danger and hope to find loot. The list goes on...and soonin Master Mode)but the weapons and abilities that you can obtain in Terraria simply make you feel amazingeach one having its own uses. The controls are entirely customizableeven allowing for extra mouse buttons to be used (if you have any)and they're extremely tight. I can't say I've ever seen a more fun grappling hook mechanic than the one in Terraria. It's like a 360 degree hookshotand the physics feel absolutely perfect on it. There's no better feeling than grappling onto a block and releasing the hook (jumping) early to launch yourself with some huge momentum (thenif you're like medoing it again immediately in the opposite directionand repeating). Mobility might be really slowand to be honesta bit boring at the start of the game (in Normal Modeat least)but it greatly improves as you make progress.the Terraria community is one of the best out there. So many helpful folks are in the official Discord Serverif you ever have any questions that the Guide NPC or the thoroughly in-depth wiki site can't answer. There are many things I didn't cover herebut I don't have time to go into every reason why I love this gameand I doubt you have much more time to keep reading them anyways. ;Pmy train of thought can sometimes go off the rails. Thanks for your time reading this farand I hope this review was helpful! Hope to see you around in the community! :Dand buy it.My wife left me and I'm just sitting here building a house.This is most likely the only review I will ever do for a gameand I believe that the grounds of my review are legitimate. I have played this game for just under 600 hours (Online) and countless more offlineas well as playing it on my friends account for many more hours. 6 years agoI asked my cousin if I could buy a game. Little did I know what I was getting myself into. It was dirt cheap10 US dollars at the timewhich is a crime considering how much love and passion has gone into this gameas well as the many sleepless nights it has provided me and many other fans. Waiting for it to downloadI was ecstatic. The art style was cool and retroand the gameplay trailers promised a land filled with enemies and abandoned temples that had succumbed to timeripe for the picking. Many biomes to traverse and even some hidden gems scattered across the world. I couldnâ€™t wait to get my grubby little hands on it. From the moment I booted up the gamethe music and visuals instantly invigorated me. It felt so cool to create your own characterso many different styles and coloursso many choices and personalizationâ€™s you could do. I spent around 5 minutes creating my first characterand after thatI was set out into a mysterious worldfilled with giant worms and flying spit bugs that would decapitate me at a moments notice. My first night is one I will never forget. Armed with shurikenâ€™s from a nearby cave and stranded on a hillI had no choice but to fight off the hordes of undead. They were coming at me from every directionand with demon eyes flying overheaddeath was inevitable.my gut instinct was to protect the guide because he had no home to hunker down in. Eventuallywe held off the masses and dawn finally came. I had realized that I needed a house to stay inand thatâ€™s when I had discovered one of the best aspects of not only this gamebut one of the best aspects of any games I have played; the building.hammer and axe together in intuitivecreative and interesting ways. The early days were not the best for buildingas the textures were quite pixelated and low quality. But the quality of the builds had gotten exponentially better. The community came up with so many unique and downright amazing buildsand it only got better with each update. There was sloping blockspaintdifferent wallshow each block melded togetherhow each block interacted with other blocksthe light sourcesthe different platforms that you could use. All this and more meant that anything that you could think of you could build. This game was one of the best imaginative and creative masterpieces that has ever graced the steam platform.I set out to find more loot to plunder. Thatâ€™s when I realised that this games combat is executed flawlessly. Normal mode was a bit too easy for meso the combat was less punishing then Iâ€™d like it to bebut the devs heard about this and introduced both expert and master mode in later updates providing a perfect balance between satisfying combat and the risk taking nature of the skirmishes that took place within the different biomes. Everything about the combat is satisfyingeven hitting a slime with a simple copper short sword or an axe is satisfying. And it only got better from there. The progression is done immaculatelyprecariously positioning the player on a tight rope of equipment and weapons while also drunkenly swinging at the player from every which wayyou have to be on your toes at all time. Just when you think youâ€™ve become a god at the game with wearing molten lava and swinging a sword made of firethe game punches you in the gut and curb stomps you. And you cannot wait to get back into it.farming and building. Everything that you do in this game contributes towards progress. Building houses? More NPCâ€™s to trade with. Want herbs? You got potions to buff you with. Fishing? Boomrare items that could (RIP Reaver shark) catapult your progress into the futureskipping entire phases of the game. Speaking of phases of the gameit has some of the best and most satisfying transitions in between gameplay elements. Every bit of progress that you make feels infinitely more satisfying than the lastand it keeps pushing you forwardto the point of not stopping. I remember trying to farm for a rare item (Turtle Shells) for 14 hours straightand I only got 1. I did other stuff in betweensurebut the game keeps you hooked in between objectives and allows for some breathing room in between bosses. As well as being incredibly challenging and rewardingit is peaceful at times.the new music added a whole new layer immersion. I could spend hours flying a kite on a rooftoplistening to the songs and watching my NPCâ€™s just walk around and chat. There is so much to do in this gameits not just combat oriented. And all of this is just in single player! The game has so much support for its communityfrom steam support and mods all the way up to the wiki and forums that the devs occasionally scour. It is a fantastic gameand I could not recommend it more.and it has been a vent for my creativity and inspiration over the years. My words could never do it justiceeven though I hope to describe even a fraction of what this game has been to me.I have played this game for 1055 hours at the time of writing.the developers release amazing and wholesome updates from time to time. I really recommend this game for mainly two reasonsit has a great replay ability were you just keep making worlds and playing it over and over again. The other reason is that you can do a lot of stuff with the world. From making giant houses and contraptions to attempting to kill a boss multiple timesit is a fun game. But it is also multiplayer which is a great addition. Playing by yourself can get boring sometimes but when I play this game with my friendsI just can't stop playing. I really recommend this gameit is definitely worth the 10 dollars.123 hours at the time of edit)although it didn't change much in the way of over-all game progressionit revamped and/or added to many of the lackluster parts of the game(ex: bloodmoon fishingtown reworknew mushroom biomessummoning reworketc). There was also variety of balancing changes that were introduced with 1.4which I believe were for the better. Some staple items were nerfedbut still very good. On the other handa lot of niche/bad items were reworked or buffedmaking them on par (or better) compared to many other items.do yourself a favor and download tModLoader off of steambecause oh mythere are a lot of great mods out there. Keep in mind that tModLoader isn't 1.4 (yet)but is still a massive blast and a great experience.boss checklistetc.)1520 hours of my life gonei spent four hours getting a pet unicorn by slaughtering many of its kindI'll load it up and just have a quick half hour....

Leaders relentlessly spam you with their disapprovalconsuming ridiculous numbers of UI-animation seconds before you can esc/cancel with each one Despite claims that leaders approve of certain thingsit seems to be an either/orall-or-nothinghair-trigger mechanism A leader will love you one turn and denounce you the nextbecause they expected you to have one more military unit that turn or something There is no nuancespectrumor ""scoring"" to this systemas far as I can tellcontrary to the claim that there are several levels between ""friendly"" and ""denounced"" It's a waste of effort to try to get along with everyone while trying to win a science or cultural victory Just let them inevitably declare war and fight them offyou want to be spammed with an inconsequential 30-second message for ""good job"" ""or ""I hate you"" several times each turn - often interrupting your next click - and wait an additional several seconds for it to respond to multiple Esc pressesand on bothit takes up to a minute to process AI turns in late game I think most hours spent playing this game are for the ""please wait"" stage Why Firaxis cannot take advantage of parallel processingor cache possible scenarios in advance while you're taking your turnI do not know There should at least be an option (or default) where other player moves have faster animations so that you can see what's happening without losing timewithout making all the animations bizarrely short like in quick combatI really no longer care about the details of each city; there are no real mistakes to be madeand I do not want to micromanage every single tile of every single city on a standard to huge map Keeping the charge mechanic on buildersbut adding an option to automate (or making it a technologylike a ""self-reliance"" civic) would probably still encourage early game caretakingwhile removing late game tediumnoit didn't take 20 years for a unit to cross a civilization It takes a lot of the oomph and fun out of army mobilization when it's far more practical to move single powerful units against the weak AI than to assemble melee and archer units into a tactically appropriate formation There's simply no reason to bother with a combined arms / blitzkrieg approach in this gamebut it's not flexible enough Districts should be removable at a costor at the VERY leastthere should be more information displayed in early game about the future optimal options for each tile It's really not fun to try to wing it and guess where it will be best to place an industrialcommercialor theater district in the futurebefore you can select those districts to see the adjacency bonuses (Or for placing future wonderseach of which have strictarbitrary requirements) At the very leastthere should be some sort of filter (a lens?) to display all adjacency bonuses on a tileI think the air unit mechanics in this game feel awkward and unnatural Why not just emulate real life instead? Carriers in real life can project power farther and to more places at once than allowed by the 2 short-range aircraftas can air bases Jet fighters intercept attackslike in Civ V They don't sit there and take it No cruise missiles or ballistic conventional weapons in this game? They do exist in real life Alsoby the time you can build aerodromes and project significant air poweryou could far more easily have created 3 times as many land units of greater power The air game seems to be rather pointlessand is placed too late in the game in terms of military advancement Air units are too weak for the time they take to acquire Minor note: you'd also think cheap surveillance or attack drones would be making an appearance by nowsince they really ruin whatever land you'd like to conquerbut at the same timeyou've got to askof what use are they in the game? The AI never has a powerful enough conventional army where you'd need nukes to defend yourself Since you can conquer all other civs with 3 army unitsit's foolish to nuke them first and ruin your takings Best guessif you're trying to win a science or cultural victoryyou'd like to ruin everyone else's day? If you're in the mood to go for one of those victoriesinitiating nuclear war doesn't really fit the billall games devolve into domination matches As soon as someone attacks you (inevitable)you will have an army and be branded a warmonger for defending yourself So you might as well remove the nuisance of neighboring civs who like to attack you Nature then takes its course Maybe this is a bit realisticbut it doesn't exactly meet the 4xvaried experience Firaxis is trying to accomplishor even just to play peacekeeper You're not notified that they are attackedand you are not given any casus belli for declaring war War of liberation (after the fact) also doesn't seem to become available when it should If you do liberate a cityall your units are immediately expelled from that territorybizarrely and unnaturally disrupting your advance in a way that just wouldn't happen in real life Takes the fun out of liberating that neighboring continent that had been conquered by a single civ; liberating France as in WWII is literally impossiblebut it makes games far too uneven Either I hit all the boosts by the luck of the map and launch a moon landing or accidentally win a culture victory in 1700or I'm tied up in a war for 500 years (in which I can't go on the offensive to end it or else become a warmonger)miss a lot of the boostsand discover petroleum in 1960and found that it's more fun to write this review than to sit through any more hours with the game That should tell you somethingNew EULA:e-mail addressphone numberphotomailing addressgeolocationor payment information In additionwe may collect your agegenderdate of birthzip codehardware configurationconsole IDsoftware products playedsurvey datapurchasesIP address and the systems you have played on We may combine the information with your personal information and across other computers or devices that you may use""The new 2K launcher broke my game Why do gaming companies feel the need to take working products that customers have already paid for and have been playing for years and break them?New EULA:e-mail addressphone numberphotomailing addressgeolocationor payment information In additionwe may collect your agegenderdate of birthzip codehardware configurationconsole IDsoftware products playedsurvey datapurchasesIP address and the systems you have played on We may combine the information with your personal information and across other computers or devices that you may use""Great game; just one problem:e-mail addressphone numberphotomailing addressgeolocationor payment information In additionwe may collect your agegenderdate of birthzip codehardware configurationconsole IDsoftware products playedsurvey datapurchasesIP address and the systems you have played on We may combine the information with your personal information and across other computers or devices that you may use""being a breach of user privacy Will not be buying anything from Firaxis or 2k until this is removedWhen I first played Sid Meier's Civ 1I played to exhaustionwatching a friend's apartmentfell asleep on the floor for a few hoursand played againuntil he and his wife came home  He let me keep the game  After a weekI settled down to a few hours per dayback when my disabilities made employment harder to find  That gameand Civ 23and 4helped keep me goinganother friend talked me out of the kiddie pool of lower difficulty settingsand I discovered how much fun each of the 40-some sides could be  The same friend gifted me Civ 6for last Christmasand I liked it so muchI gifted the $80 every-DLC-as-it-comes-out edition to another friend  I put about 15000 hours into Civ 5and have already put over 4000 hours into Civ 6my main thought was channeling UPS: ""What can brown do for you?""

Good questionbut it's okAlexander the Great still loves yousuch as unit scaling and modelling and such Before the game was launched there were many people who expressed concern over a ""mobile game"" aestheticjustly concerned that 2K might be trying to grant their next installment with some more mass appeal at the expense of anyone being able to take this seriously Thankfullythe gameplay hasn't been dumbed downso much as screwed up (see agendas) I am not terrified of this army of strangely proportioned stretch armstrong figures marching towards mebecause I'm too distracted by the traderwhose cart is 2 or 3 times taller than my palace In Civ 5when the Mongol horde was at my bordersit stretched on and on likewella horde Now it appears to be maybe 20 horses all togethereach being roughly the size of an entire buildingand altogether looking rather silly If course there's another reason not to be intimidated by the Mongol hordeor anyone else's horde for that matter The entire combined forces of all other AI civs could be beaten back with a damp rag and a can do attitudewhich is particularly damning in a game that always ends in a war Alexander the Great of Macedon may command the most fearsome force known to manbut rest assuredit'll be soundly defeated by simply doing the following; ranged units + garrion promotionplace in city centres and encampments Or just wait them outwhen you think the enemy has gained the advantage they'll just sit there and contemplate lifeor throw themselves away on fortified units with ranged support It's worth pointing out that at launch the AI did not even know how to use boats or planesso I wouldn't hold your breath or anyone elses for any of this to change any time soonyou can bring that into a game with your friends and make them regret basking in your presence The most fun I've managed to have in this game has been with friendswhere the only real competition in scienceculturefaith and of coursewarare the other human players The AI might aswell be so many other city states Oh and the music While I miss wartime music (listening to the cheerful Kongo theme while nuclear hellfire engulfs the planet is a bit jarring) the whole idea of music evolving with eras is just fantastic Entering the industrial era to ""Scotland the Brave"" blaring in your ears while you agressively bagpipe the inferior nations of the world into submission is satisfyingto say the least But then you realize that you're building the same cities all over the mapand that the last game you tried to get into was the same as this oneand that enemy you've been contending with isn't really contending so much as falling behind because he decided to give up on winning And then everyone denounces you for being close to winning yourself And then I get tired of this and try and get Civ 5 to work again with a bagillion modsI always end up building the same 2 or 3 different cities with no variation)I lost interest There were other mods I used that also made it funwhich are no longer usable since the summer patch (I thinkit might have been the spring one I can't remember) I cannot reccomend this game because it does not stand up on it's own as a civ game should Time and time again the modding community has found and fixed bugs that should have been dealt with before release Maybe the next big dlc will make Civ6 a game worthy of the franchiseI don't know Until such a time I do not think anyone should buy this game That is my opinion and I am entitled to it no matter how many hours I have playedor whether or not I ""got my money's worth""I would not take any review seriously with few hours playedregardless of wether they reccomended it or not If my friends came with the game in a sort of package dealthen sure I'd reccomend itbut I got them elsewhere)and with it some more game mechanics for the AI to struggle with There's really not much more to it than that Obvious one is climate change and disastersof which there is very little change and it's not very disastrous Just keep a builder or two on stand by if you're in a disaster prone area and you'll be fine Of the couple times I've had the patience to see a game to completionnot once did the sea level risewhich leads me to believe that you have to really go out of your way to screw up the planet The main incentive for burning fossil fuels seems to be powering tier 3 buildings in certain districts Not only is this not necessaryas these buildings still provide their standard yieldbut you can just hold out for cleaner energy sources a couple more techs down the linewhich at the very least is a more nostalgic kind of stupid Fans of Civ 5 can look back on fond memories of the great nations of the world banding together against the true enemy of civilizationtruffles Voting yourself is pointless (unless you're playing Sweden)because the AI will mass vote to ban random things regardless of whether it hurts them or not"
1,"[h1]PSA 21.07.2020[/h1]it will move to the Epic Games Store and won't be available to get on Steam anymoreif you own it you will still be able to playthough.but be aware that this decision has been made.than big balls and little cars - and that's what makes it so interesting and worth playing for a longlong time.so let me give you a fast overview:intermediate and pro[/td]traded or bought[/td]awesome and free updates[/td]the foremost reason isthat there is far too much I want to talk about.I will put a lot of reference to it and go into more detailso I hope you can accept my decision and enjoy it regardless.trust me that you can have fun without investing a ton of time.it attracts trollsplain idiots and other sorts of human scumso do yourself a favor and disable voice and maybe text chat in the options and you are good to go.I would be grateful for a 'thumbs up'if you didn't like ityou can give me a 'thumbs down' but I would be glad to hear your opinion on what you didn't like.Rocket League is less of a ""sports game"" and more of an actual sport. In FIFA or Madden you have a ""pass"" buttonbut to make a pass in Rocket League you have to drive your car into the ball at the right speed and angle to send it over to where your teammate is going. You have to create the pass yourselfand it can be anythingfrom a hard bounce off the back wall to a soft lob over the defender.shootingdribblingtacklesjukesthey're all in the gamebut you  have to make them happen yourselfnot just press the right button. At firstjust driving car to ball is a challengebut as your skill growsthe freedom to create any play you can imagine and execute is unlike anything you'll find in a ""sports game"". Together with the mechanical skill to do what you want with the ballyou'll have to develop positional awareness and learn proper rotation and game sense.that can keep challenging you as you improveand improveand improve beyond what you ever imagined you'd be capable of. In factthis is the ONLY one I know.BRING IT BACK TO STEAMEPICGAMES. (smhRocket League is a perfect game for short breaks. 5 minutes of flying and exploding carsthen I can continue doing whatever I was doing before. (To be honestit usually ends up in ""one more match"" multiple times. That's how it's good.passing to a goalsaving the ball from reaching your goal at the last possible momentfailing hard and scoring an own goal... These are all moments you will see in Rocket League.When you buy this gameit will take about 20-30 hours to actually start hitting balls. By 100-150 hoursyou'll be flying around the map to score some crazy looking goals (in your opinion. But thenthat's when the fun actually begins: mastering the basic moves of the game is basically mastering 1% of what you can do in this game. You'll end up playing more and more and moreuntil you realize you've just spent three hours in practice hitting the same shot again and again. Yesthis game is higly addictive. My favorite game ever without any doubts.[b]Rocket League has one of the best progression systems I've ever seen in a video game before...[/b]you would have likely looked up advanced tips for Rocket League. Worst mistake of your life. You now know what aerials are. You think you can fly. The ball comes up high and you go for an aerial. Once you jumpyou fly straight into the ground and continue to do frontflips until you land on your back... What the fuck happened there? Oh. You're using keyboard. Yeah nahtime to get a controllerdick-head.you'll wreck anything and anyone with ease. You can also pull off freestyles consistently. Nice job! Also be sure to prepare for an endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Legend!""still prepare for another endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Rocketeer!""I absolutely love this game and I'm sure anyone will. I've literally never seen someone dislike this game after they've played 10 hours. (Rocket League moves onto a whole-nother level of fun and addiction once you learn how to fly.just trust me when I say it is one of the most fun and addictive games I've ever played (more gripping than Skyrim and GTA.4 player split screen? cross platform connectivity? rocket cars? These devs don't fuck around.Great Gamewas better without epic gamesGreat gamewas better without epic gamesSo Epic takes overbreaks the gamecan't connect to the Epic Services so I can't playtakes away garage itemsand then Steam blocks new reviews due to ""off topic"" review activity unless you change the settings manually. Went from a game a played daily to a game I literally can't play. Epic can go blow themselves.Hate football games.This game is extremely fun!Reminds me of the golden days of gaming. No bsno gimmickjust simply a good gameawesome!FirstRocket League is the most fun you can have in a game since Team Fortress 2. It's like a sport for fighter pilots. I break controllers playing it because it's so intense. I'm told I make ridiculous facial expressions while going for a kick or block or aerial dogfight fenderbender. I'm pretty sure I have mild carpal tunnel syndrome from it. I adore this gameI want to play it forever. I don't give two shits about football or carsbut Rocket League is A+ and then some.Psyonix's capitulation to Epic Games is an extreme disappointmenteven personally heartbreaking. I'm from Hong Kong and spent the last year watching firsthand my city turning into a police state on the orders of the Communist Party of China. I've had tear gas in my apartmentfriends with broken bones and concussionsand rule of law no longer exists here. I have PTSD from filming our now crushed pro-democracy movementand tens of thousands of young people here have it a thousand times worseeven if they're not in jail already. Half the city is in a state of shockdepression or worse.hence the absurd amount of money it has to buy rather than earn its share of the market (GTA5 for free must have cost billions. Maybe Psyonix needed the cashand I honestly want them to survive and thrivebut it should be clear by now that any company in China of Tencent's size and scope operates under the auspice of the CCP. People finally know the dangers of Huaweibut Tencent is no less an arm of that statethe world's most powerful and technologically advanced authoritarian dictatorship.there's so much love in it that I can't not still adore it. But this is a stab to the heartand frankly you guys deserve the tsunami of negative reviews you're about to receive.

The expensive items now are cheaper like Titanium White ZombaTitanium White Octanethey have modified the market weirdly and unbalanced. In my opinionthe community have to decide the pricesnot the devs. They could have atleast implemented a salvage systemsomething so you can get for those blueprints to craftto give a little bit of chance to get something -> decryptors were a thingeven if you couldn't trade items from decryptorsbut with a little bit of luck you could have got something nicelike I didso why not changing decryptors with something new ?

You will never be bored of this gamebut pushing yourself and your friends to the limit is possible with so many difficultiesgetting so difficult and tough to move forwardbut we persevered (also because we put in so much time already)and always ending with a huge feeling of accomplishmentyou'd know I love the customisation functionality I love the masks I love them so much!ê·¸ëŠ” ë‚˜ì—ê²Œì´ ê²Œìž„ì„ ì¶”ì²œ í•œ ì‚¬ëžŒì´ë‹¤ê·¸ëŠ” ëŠìž„ì—†ì´ ëª¨ë“  ê°•ë„ì™€ ìž„ë¬´ë¥¼ ì´ëŒ ê²ƒìž…ë‹ˆë‹¤ ë™ì•ˆ ë‚˜ëŠ” ì˜¨ìœ í•˜ê²Œ ë„ì›€ì„ í•˜ë ¤ê³  ë’¤ì— ë”°ë¼ê° ê°œë³„ íž™ìŠ¤íŠ¸ì˜ ìˆœìˆ˜í•œ ë‹¤ì–‘ì„±ê³¼ ì°½ì˜ë ¥ì€ ë¯¿ì„ ìˆ˜ ì—†ìŠµë‹ˆë‹¤í•˜ì§€ë§Œ ì œí•œì— ìžì‹ ê³¼ ì¹œêµ¬ë¥¼ ë°€ì–´ ë„ˆë¬´ ë§Žì€ ì–´ë ¤ì›€ê³¼ í•¨ê»˜ ê°€ëŠ¥ í•˜ë‹¤ìš°ë¦¬ëŠ” ì¸ë‚´ì‹¬ì„ ê°€ì§€ê³  (ì´ë¯¸ ë„ˆë¬´ ë§Žì€ ì‹œê°„ì„ í• ì• í–ˆê¸° ë•Œë¬¸ì—) í•­ìƒ ì—„ì²­ë‚œ ì„±ì·¨ê°ìœ¼ë¡œ ëë‚¬ìŠµë‹ˆë‹¤ë‹¹ì‹ ì€ ë‚´ê°€ ì‚¬ìš©ìž ì •ì˜ ê¸°ëŠ¥ì„ ì‚¬ëž‘ ì•Œê³  ìžˆì„ ê²ƒìž…ë‹ˆë‹¤I get into a gameAs someone who has spent 4 and a half years basically living and breathing Payday 2 and getting very involved in its communityI have a very weird love/hate relationship with this game It is an extremely fast paced 4 person co-op shooterand played at its lower levels of difficulty it can be very thrilling and fun After you reach a certain point howeverPD2 becomes extremely flawedtedious and irritating The game has changed so much from its launch days to the endand the story of the game is also the story of its developerOverkill Starbreeze If nothing elsePayday 2 is a bright and shining example of why ""buff things instead of nerfing them"" is extremely toxic to a game's overall longevityPD2 cribs very hard from the formula set up by Valve's Left 4 Dead series You and a group of 3 other friends can team up as bank robbers and pull off daring heists and do random crime related things The stakes start relatively low with knocking off corner shops and small jewelry storesand like many other things PD2 relatedeach new heist scenario had to top the previous one so by the end you're robbing the alien Illuminati and stealing nuclear warheads to sell on the Russian black marketpart RPGyour skills matter just as much as your guns You'll need to play heists to gain XP to purchase skillswhich let you do mundane things like tie down hostages faster or increase your reload speedto the fantastical such as gain up to 100% more damage the less health you haveor yell at teammates to revive them from a distance PD2 also features a rather impressive and extensive real world arsenal Many real life guns and gun attachments can be earned through RNG dropsthough the vast loot pool means earning the exact things you want is difficultand the developers were never able to balance all the guns properly so many are just near-identical copies of each other stat-wisemaps had an additional ""pre-planning"" phase that you choose where to place items such as extra ammo or healing kitsas well as purchase assets to make heists easierand the ""loud"" phase The stealth is very shallow in depth You are not able to interact with guards beyond killing themand you are generally not allowed to kill more than 4 before the game forces the stealth phase to end A handful of maps have distraction mechanicsbut you will mainly be navigating around and avoiding guards This can be easier said than done due to a lack of situational awareness from being a first person gamealong with latency making multiplayer stealth all but impossible even on the best of connectionslest they be overwhelmed After years of never ending cycles of ""buff the players -> the players are now too strong -> buff the enemies""this has evolved from a slowmethodically paced cover shooter into equipping some sort of life steal/fast health regeneration buildcombining it with the lowest possible armor for massive speed boosts like you're playing OG Doom with always run turned onand then bringing either an auto-shotgun or LMG because they are both the highest DPS weapon types in the game and have the most ammo efficiency It's not even challenging at that point; it's just tedious because the lead designer's idea of ""difficulty"" was having 100 hitscan enemies spawn at oncebut prospective buyers do not need to be scared off by it One thing Overkill did before imploding was implement an ""Ultimate Bundle"" option to buy everything at a significant discountthough removing the ability to purchase DLC a la carte was a bad PR move If you just buy the vanilla edition without DLCyou can still play any of the paid maps as a client; you are just restricted from hosting them PD2 has microtransactionsbut they are fairly benign now and any crates you get can be freely openedPayday 3 seems less and less like a reality PD2 has a ton of bugs that were never fixedand the balance was left in dire straits At its heightit spent resources perpetually churning out DLC every month with shiny new overpowered things to keep players paying money instead of fixing bugs and keeping the game healthy You can chart the fortunes of Overkill Starbreeze by Payday content They added weirdfourth wall breaking items and content to promote their other gamesor fellow indie developersno matter how poorly it fit with the universe and aesthetic Someone somewhere is still wearing the Star VR maskmade to promote Overkill Starbreeze's utter failure of a VR initiative The developers made elaborate map changes to promote their WW2 spin-offRaid: WW2another game I also wrote way too many words about In the final year of content developmentbefore support officially ended and then the development house imploded shortly afterthe quality of the content dropped noticeably Map bugs that hadn't existed in years were backart and animation quality suffered immensely with a lot of copy-paste implementationetcand experiencing it can be quite fun especially with a group of close friends If you're into modsthe mod scene is fairly activethough the ease of modding also makes this game a playground for hackers and some of the most popular mods might as well be hacks The difficulty curve in this game is extremely broken and what depth to PD2's meta that existed before is basically gonebut played casually this game can still be a blastI get into a gameDo you like stealing money and killing cops? no? goodcause this game is mostly about fixing drills and throwing bagsRobbin banks is really funand playing Payday is a great way to unwind afterwardsAn atrocious masterpieceif the cloaker doesn't kick you the host willfunny mask man steal moneyRobbing banks is really funand playing Payday is a great way to unwind afterwardsi went into a bank with a minigun with an extremly short barrel and a flamethrower while wearing a doge mask i proceeded to burn literally all the civilians and then a man crawled out of the sewers then did a front flip over a honda civic and kicked me in the jaw and commited horrible acts of police brutality~ DIFFICULTY ~~ DIFFICULTY ~Having Put 1000 hours into this gamehaving almost every achievement and beating all heists on the highest difficulty (DSOD)it's time for me to leave a review I like this gameit's incredibly fun to play with friendsbut it may not be very fun if you are a solo player I will focus this review on Gameplay Balance of this gameas I feel like it is what both makes and breaks this game for some playerseliminating most gameplay builds from being viableleaving only select few Builds as ""good enough"" performers on a regular basis Does that mean that you ABSOLUTELY can not run your favorite ""non-meta deck"" on the higher difficulties? Noyou still canbut the ""META"" builds just are less affected by the bullshit thrown by Death Sentence Whichin my opinionis not a good gameplay designor just are so bad that there is no merit to using them even on lower difficultiesand you can customize a lot of gameplay aspects of this gamefrom simple quality of life modsto straight up gameplay-changing mods that can alter the logic of the game There are also several mods that completely alter the gameplay experiencecompletely re-balancing existing gameplay elementsand introduce new elements to make the game feel freshsome are weapon packssome are heist packssome are characters This game has a lot of weaponsbut most of them have very similar statsand weapons could be broken down into key categories that suit different styles of gameplay You do not NEED these DLCs to be good at the gamebut some of the perk decks/weapons mods provided by them are much better than their vanilla counterparts They tend to be cheap on saleat leastA few days ago I was driving with my girlfriend and I saw a pile of planks on the side of the road I thought to myself""I'd best remember the location of those planksbecause when the heist starts I may need to board up windows with them"" It's a testament to how addtictive this game can be I later shared the thought with my girlfriend and she called me a loserbut I've spent 300+ hours in Payday 2 and not nearly as much time in her so who cares what she thinks 5 starsDoing public stealth missions is probably the worst thing to doNever do public stealth missionI blew up Malaysia"
1,"I have been playing BF games since back in 2003when you had to go and buy them from the game shop down the town center They came on a CD/DVD BF2 & Special Forces were fantastic gameswas really looking forward to ituntil I played in a match with more hackers than there were normal players!!!!and yetafter 1 monththe same hackers are STILL PLAYING the game So you go back to the forumpost about it againand EA shut down your post and mark their spam post as the solution to your posteven though they haven't answered anything properly - They then tell you they do not allow posts about anti-cheats or cheating on teh AHQ FOrum - Really? Is that because you know you are useless at stopping it EA??if it wasn't for all the hackers and EA's lack of care about getting ird of them it would be a good game!Plagued by hackersalmost no oceania communitydevs don't carehackers are so well known that players recognize them by name but they still haven't been banned Lazynow that I've played a bit more I'd like to revise my initial thoughts Battlefield V has the hallmarks of a good gamethe bullet ballistics are goodteam work and strategy is goodthe graphics and cool WW2 weaponry are good But all this is over-arched by critical flaws that I'm guessing were the result of EA deciding this game wasn't likely to be as profitable as they were expecting Customization feels lacking at best with a lot of cosmetic items being really boring or really expensive to encourage the use of in game currency Weapon customization has similar problems with only a few ""specializations"" for each weaponmostly making it magically have less recoil or reload faster among other uncreative things The most critical flaw this game suffers is the complete abandonment by the developers They obviously knew their time wouldn't make them money and decided to leave the game in a state that feels late beta at best There's a lot of controversy in the comments about me saying the game is plagued by hackers but I stand by this statement It's been abandonedplayers don't get bannedreports don't get answered If you want to play the game despite these flaws because you like WW2 or the Battlefield seriesthere's definetly fun to be had but heres a few tips:the official servers receive seemingly 0 maintenance and manually administrated servers are massively more effective at banning hackers than the official servers EA you should be ashamedUSA and Europe are probably okay Don't count on being able to find a server if you're a night owl like meBuy it if you like getting shot through walls from across the map Hack city Spent more money on the profanity filter than the anti cheatThe game is a blast when there are no people using exploits Some days you cant play a game without changing servers multiple times to get around the people loading cheat software to aimbot you I have had several matches where a single soldier will lock down our entire team at the spawn with a head seeking MG and the developer doesnt really seem to do anything about it Not even a vote kick feature let alone the most basic of anti cheat software How hard is it to do some captures when someone has a K/D of 50+ to 0?BF2042 makes this look goodWhen you spend more money on Censoring the game chat then the anti-cheatRoblox has better anti-cheatNever have I seen so many hackers in a multiplayer game before that go unpunished No in-game way to report them either they just tell you to spend hours and hours going to their website and sending a manual report in and doing 1000 and 1 steps to provide evidenceroblox have better anti cheatfull of hackers and takes a while to find games Ea killed this franchisedidn't know soldiers in world war 2 had aim bot and wall hack technologyI'm sorry Battlefield Vyou're redeemedFix cheater problem then we can talkThis game is currently infested with hackers I'm talking ""90 and 0shooting you from across the map and through buildings""  kind of hackers There's about 4 of them that entire lobbies have been reporting over and over againfor over a weekyet they're still thereruining games There's NOTHING being done about itthat definitely should've been ironed out by nowunless you're just looking to play some single-player campaign missionsToo many cheaters in this game It seems like every 4 or 5 severs there is just a blatant cheater shooting people in the head from across the map It really ruins the experience and EA doesn't seems to do anything about this Save your money for the next battlefieldLove the Batlefield series - imagine EA would care to solve the cheater issues in all their online games i might actually enjoy it until then unplayable and in a pathetic stateroblox have better anti cheatI'd rather buy winrarPlay it for free as long as the offer goesyou against hackersToo many hackers around It is to a point clearly that the developers are not intending to do anything about it"
1,"Fun and relaxing game Always something to do and the updates keep it interesting I am 72have tried to play other gamesbut they cannot compete with Stardewso I only play Stardew Thank youConcerned ApeThis game got me through a really dark place in my life I lost my jobspouseand home in less than a year I would chop wood and fish when I couldn't find the energy to do anything else and fall asleep on the couch listening to the background music I've put thousands of hours into Stardew Valley The little successes I had were the catalyst I needed to think maybe I could have little successes again in lifetoo Highly recommend Thank you for making this gameI ask my crush to dance She replies""Ewno""Stardew Valleywhere you wana try the game for just 5 minutes but end up playing for 9 hoursthis game let me live my wildest sexual fantasies of having a job and someone who actually loves meVery easily my favourite game It's like playing a hugi play this when i'm sadMe playing Stardew Valley at 3am worrying about staying up too late in-game because I won't have enough energy the next dayI remember buying this game for my brother a few years back Didn't think much of it at the timebut I thought it would be a nice gift for him I remember seeing him playing it from time to timethe message indicating that he'd started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen There was always a certain small pride in seeing thatbecause to me it meant that he was enjoying my giftI sat down and booted up his computer All that was on there was ChromeSteamWordand a few games One of themof coursewas Stardew Valleyclocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer He had used every square inch to its maximum potentialand was making ridiculous amounts of cash It was only then did I see just how much he loved his present No other game he played quite captured his affection as much as this one None of his friends really knew about ithowever; it seems like he preferred to keep it to himself Like it was his own little bit of heaven he could turn to whenever he wantedI can't help but smile whenever I play this gamethe world feels lived-in and naturaland the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable It's hard to stop once I get invested in the game; minutes can easily turn into several hours And nowwith the multiplayer betaI play for even longer with my friendseach of us dedicated to our desired jobs Most of allhoweverwe're all just happy to be togetherit takes away the emptiness inside of youthis game is dangerous i would recommend not playing it unless you want to be completely incapacitated for the first 2 weeks you own itGreat buy for coronavirus quarantineOne thing I never realized until I finished the game is that you shouldn't rush it I got everything done 8 years in gamefound all the secretsgot 100% completionist on the trackerfound all the secret cutscenescollected every hatsaccessoriesrings and weapons that are available in the game and have completed all endgame content But when the credit starts rollingall I feel is emptiness and a void that I can no longer fill up This is a wonderful game that's just so inviting and calming to playwhether it is by myself or with a friend and now it is all overtake my advice and enjoy the slow ride Don't rush it and try to get everything with a guide early onbecause all there is at the end is the creditsi forget im depressed when playingCollege make me :(I grew up playing Harvest Moon with my mom and it is one of my fondest memories She would always buy me the new one for Christmasand we would play it all dayfilling notebooks full of recipes and discussing which person we hoped to marry Although Stardew Valley has unmistakable similarities to Harvest Moonit is a masterpiece in it's own rightone that is very dear to my heart after all those years playing with my mumheartwarming and detailed It's complicated enough that so many hours later I still haven't completed most of the achievements or befriended most of the townsfolkbut it's simple and easy enough that I play it almost every night on the couch after workbut this certainly deserves a ten out of tenIf you're looking for a wholesome game that destroys your IRL health barlook no further The regularly satisfying hits of dopamine will cause addiction You'll lose sleep due to the ""Just one more day"" factor You'll strain your eyes Your most visited website will change The existential crisis that will awaken in you for enjoying a pixelated2-D world more than your reality will send you down a path of reflection andin most casesenlightenment Probablyi have mental illness and the game makes me forget about that for a little whileplay the gameplay this game with the characters wiki open because nothing will hurt more than putting all ur hard work into growing a cauliflower and then picking the person u like the most for this special gift and them just saying 'ew'I play this game when I'm sad"

1,"Playing this game is like committing to a long term relationshipexcept the girl hates you and beats you with a cricket batFirstMy playing hours are like x2 because I also played a lot of houres outside steamI would like to give a positive review But unfortunately I decided not to do that  And also have decided to uninstall this game At a given moment you are just done and all the trust is gonebut are often treated as Gaijin's enemyso compression Which means that some vehicles dominate heavily and some do not have a chance at all when they come  against each other in a match Gaijin does not want to solve this problem because they want everyone to find a match quickly (this is my biggest problem with this game)Gaijin does not like criticism Post on their form that are critical and viewed by enough players just disappear Gaijin deniesfor examplethat it was possible to cheat in their game When a youtuber proved that it was possible Gaijin wanted to copyright strike against this person or put the Realistich game mode to Arcade As a kind of punishment for the player or something I have no idea why Gaijin behaved rather childishtanks shot that disappeared in the airto planes that were shot in 1/2 and keeps flying smoothly I have seen everything over the years Fortunatelythere are never many bugs so that is goodcompletely ignored or can no longer be found (disappears) It looks more like Gaijin sees you as a burden instead of helpI close it hereThis game is like an abusive girlfriendOkay listen222 hours in this game while I'm writing this I get that it's confusing that I'm making a negative reviewbut one of the worstmost scummy products I've ever seen One that preys on people with addictive personalities in a wide spectrum of waysand playing well gives a nice bonus Winning matches massively multiplies silver lion gains (ieif you kill 1 person in a match you lose in the planes mode you'll get a small amount of silver lionsbut even just one kill in a match you win is worth a fair amountand to a degree this gets better the better you play) But here's the well ""but"" Silver lions are precisely designed so that when you first start playing the gameno matter what (iewhether you are completely free to playjust have a premium vehicleor have premium vehicles and a premium account) you will be getting enough silver lions to more than cover the silver lion costs of the vehicles you will have access too Low tier vehicles cost basically nothing to repairas do almost all premiums (and premium accounts and vehicles both massively boost silver lion income while using them) You might be seeing the problem alreadybut if not stick with me here As you progress through the gameif you're free to play you will at first quickly unlock cheap vehicles before reaching more expensive onesthen things will be slower and slower to unlock and more expensive To be clearall of this so far isn't a big deal The issue comes when you reach about 70 (battle ratingwhich is basically just a ""level"" for matchmaking balance) for ground forces or about 80 for air forcesin my experience At this point vehicles are sluggish to unlock and extremely expensive Buying themtraining a crew slot to play themand every modification all costs SLbut also repairing and rearming the aircraft after the battle At the lower tiers you might not even notice this By about 60 you'll almost certainly notice this but unless you play very poorly it won't be a major issue You might have to take it easy right after buying a newly unlocked vehiclebut other than that you're fine But beyond thatcertain vehicles (seemingly arbitrarilythough there's always a long winded explanation that boils down to ""balance"") cost bafflinglyridiculouslyhilariously high amounts of silver lions If you have about 2-3 million silver lions at lower tiersyou're golden You can lose some of it if you have some rough matchesbut you'll be fine At the higher tiersyou could burn through that in a day just by being unlucky Half the time you unlock a new jet or main battle tank it's so expensive you either can't buy itor can but then can't play it because if you die before getting a kill you lose massive amountsit sorta brings us to the next monetizationbut basicallyyou can buy Silver lions for real money If you run out you can pay for more Now full transparencythis isn't technically pay-to-play It's more like ""pay-to-easily-play-high-tier"" You're not locked out of playing the gamebut if you really want to play high tier modern stuff and don't have silver lionsyou're out of luck unless you have amazing matches Certain vehicleslike the B-29/Tu-4 long range bomber have such a high repair costand such a low survival rate that they are essentially useless Gaijin balances almost exclusively through SL costs It's awfulnext up is Golden Eagles This is the premium currency This is nothing newevery F2P game has them pretty much It's not something I would review a game as negative for normally but Golden Eagles are a small piece of the puzzle They can be used to buy the majority of the premium vehicles in the gameas well as silver lionspremium account timedecalsdecorationsect Premium vehicles are often unbalanced on launch but get balanced overtime I don't know if this is intentional or not but after the IS-6 dominated for over a year Gaijin has toned this down a lot Stillsome are better than others They're objectively not pay to winbut they are clearly pay to progress The biggest issue is that new players can pay about the price of a full AAA game for a high-tier vehicle without learning how to use it The game is loosely designed in such a way so that as you progress you learn the skills you need to progress It's not super linear but it naturally happens fairly well But if you can just buy the highest tier stuff with no limitations then you skip the grindyesbut you also skip the learning This leads to a lot of very inexperienced players at high tierwho often teamkillramblockcapture-point stealand otherwise ruin the game for what should be the most dedicated part of the playerbase To be clear I'm not strictly against this but there's already so little incentive for team-play in this game that new players with high tier premiums are never actually gonna put in the time to learn how to play like experienced players do Againfinebut it's two clashing playstyles that shouldn't ever really meet Jets and main battle tanks shouldin theoryhave the most depth and highest skill ceiling in the game but through a mix of map designmechanics and this aforementioned premium issuethey actually have the least depth aside from the very lowest tiersand devolve into head-on ramming and head on chargesnormal for F2P gamesbut on top of everything aboveand everything belowit's a lot They basically make it so you get more research and silver lions You progress faster and run out of lions slower It effects other players in no waysince even if you have a premium accountunless you buy a high tier premiumby the time you get to high tier you'll likely be fairly experiencedbut the game loves to tempt you with the fact it's technically possible (until they add the next thingand they add new vehicles every update more or less) Neverever ***EVER*** use convertible research unless you have some golden eagles laying around and a bit of research you don't feel like doing Even then it makes more economic sense to just get premium (vehicles or account) This is a waste of money Do not use your eagles on thislike the KV-220and thus go for hundreds and hundreds of dollars A lot of the cheap skins on here are great though and a portion of the money goes to the artist so it's not the worst thing ever You can get some of this stuff for free easily Againthis isn't on its own that big of a dealbut keep in your mind that all of this is in *one* gameOverwatchSmite ect)I hate War Thunderit's my favorite gameDo not to sell your soul to Gaijinyou will never get it backOh how I wish i could call an arty strike on Gaijin's head officeincluding the largest Youtuber Phlydaily was pushing to have parts and fire extinguishers to come for free with every vehicleinstead of making it a module to research (or spend money on) So if you get shot in the transmissionyup you cant move the rest of the matchor get shot in the barrel? Yupyou are completely useless unless you can make it to a cap point which sometimes there is only 1 Guess what they said ""no"" and have since never acknowledged community suggestions since then due to the horrible PR fallout They balance the game based off players stats in that particular vehicle Leaving some vehicles completely broken or overpowered for months while data comes in for them to actually do something about it Easily the most frustrating of these cases was the fact that the battle rating spread is so compressed from power creep that they couldn't figure out what level to put the Maus at to make it competitive and balanced so they just removed it from the game LOL yeah they barred new players from being able to research it cause they were too lazy to fix their game They also will gladly make up stats or armor values about tanks to fit their view of what they think it should be capable ofif you don't get premium AND a high tier premium vehicle ($80 for a year of premium time and $40-$60 a piece for the vehiclessome of which are also broken - STRV 103-0 - to name one) then it will literally take you 6-12 months to grind out a single nation So if you are strapped on time to dedicate to gamingthen just pick a nation and stick to it or you won't see anything past tier 3-4 (early world war 2 armored vehicles) It will easily take you a year or more to grind out the top tier jets/tanks of any nationwhich is all the major updates contribute to the gamethey generally make it overpowered so people will spend money on getting the ""op vehicles"" The other portion of new vehicles have some extremely frustrating broken/missing feature that they don't address for months and in most cases years after it being well known to the communityleaving you open to being sniped (sometimes from the enemy spawn) 15 seconds after spawning There are countless ""unintended"" spots that completely break the map allowing you to see the entire battlefield while also being immune to fire if you have a strong turret (they tried to fix this but failed) Horrible design flaws continue with layouts thatin combination with game modesmake tanks designed for hull down and defensive game play completely worthless because you HAVE to push to the objective to cap and win Oh that's right there is 1 single type of game mode: dominationwhere you have to push to the middle of the map and cap a pointsometimes there's 1 2 or 3 Yup that's all we get for variation in game play across all types (sim/realistic/arcade) Also since they added thermal sights and night vision devicesevery 10th game you get is a night battle Ya and it can take a week or two w/o premium time to grind out the modules that allow for this Especially for night battles but also generally most people just leave the match  after 1 death This is only a problem for the higher tiers thoughmade worse by top tier premiums making for many players to not have lineups to  have a proper ability to fight and finish a match The worst offenses for Gaijin's inability to make viable maps is that they give you city maps that measure 1km from your spawn to enemy spawn in modern MBT's As well as very poorly thought out maps that encourage players to go straight to the enemy spawn and spawn camp instead of trying to navigate/fight in their confusing layouts that make no sense from a gameplay perspective but ""are accurate to a real life location""and a lot of the time immune to even direct hits from SAMs and ATGMs Even hitting the engine and causing a fire won't cause it to crash; only gently begin losing altitude all the while spamming hydra rockets at youwhich auto-kill you if you're in a light tank/anti-aircraft They don't even have their own (functioning) game mode meaning you're forced to use them in ground battles to grind out the later heli's Which by-the-way require an EXTREME amount of grinding to get to the top of the lineOR as the developers likely intended: just buy your way to For exampleI'm grinding the German line with the BO 105 CB-2: I have 50 kills and 32 battles in a PREMIUM heli with premium time and I'm not even a 5th of the way through the first heli to research 40k/170k RP (research points) and then there's 3 more after that (requiring an additional 12 MILLION RP+4 million silver lions) when you finally get the most OP/actually good heli for Germany which gets 8 fire and forget missiles that allow you to raze entire flanks/teams within a minute if left unchecked Did I mention only about a third of battles in ground mode actually will net you enough spawn points to even take one out with AGMs and not just dumb fire rockets This coupled with the aforementioned horrible map designsleading to many many games being throwawaysmake it nearly impossible without spending money to achieve the top tier heli'sAKA they are irrelevant to winning the game except for literally 2 bombers in the whole game that can actually win the match if they're ignored - B-29 and TU-4 You can't respawn either in this mode so if you spent 7-10 minutes climbing to altitude trying to catch a bomberonly to have them shoot you in the engine then guess what: you have to fly back to your airfield and repair and if the match ends by the time you are capable again you receive nothing for your effort At which point you just spent 20 minutes waiting for a gamethen just flying around climbing/running/cursinga majority of players -including myself- play thisthere aren't enemy markers unless they are hit with any type of munitionwhich pings a red icon on the mini-map No assist to aiming and allows for sneaky plays at the cost of also being chop liver for aircraft which are constantly a headache and only require 2-3 kills AA is cheap to respawn in but some nations get excellent AA while others don't even have any for certain BR's (battle ratings) A massive problem with aircraft being so easily available is the all too common revenge bombingusually involving the enemy just flying directly into the ground on top of you dropping their bombs a second before death - usually also having enough points again to spawn into a light/medium tank againhere is the suicide prevention hotline: 800-273-8255Can be funbut the more you play the more you get angryAllow me to preface this by saying I have been playing this game for years and have spent hundreds if not thousands of dollars on this game Whether on premium currencybuying vehicle packs from the online store or buying premium time At the time of writing this review I have 240ish days left of Premium time leftbut now 1500 hours later I see the game for what Gaijin have turned it into They turned a fun gamealbeit with a heavy dose of grindinginto one of the least fun games I have played in a long timewhile not the best I've seenis very passable for a Free to Play titlewith only minor hiccups throughout my timethey definitely exist but they did not hinder my gameplay to the point where I would complain about thembut not with both simultaneouslywhether for Silver Lions (SL) to purchase things you've unlockedor Research Points (RP) to actually unlock themis a slog It has been only getting worse as time goes by It can take ages to unlock the ability to purchase a new vehicle(topping out at just shy of 400 thousand RP)let alone have the Silver to actually purchase the vehicle (upwards of 2 million) and then pay to put a crew in the vehicle (2-3 hundred thousand) Keeping in mindwithout paying for premium accountyou may only get 500-1500 RP and 10-20 thousand SL per matchwhich can take anywhere from 5-35 minutesand some of the best and most unique vehicles can only be obtained by purchasing Gaijins premium currencyGolden Eagles(GE) There are alternate ways to getting it besides buying itas I have heard that certain apps will allow you to accumulate GE over timebut I did not use them myself There is a secondary currency that they use called Gaijin coins that are 1:1 with USDwhich is used in the marketplace they createdit completely changed the way the game felt once it was introduced It's just like CS:GO skinsonly its not just skins Imagine if you had to buy the AK-47 in CS:GO for $700 before you could use itgoing so far as planning on removing vehicles because they would be to hard to think of a way to balance them Standard MO for Gaijin is to release one or two shiny new vehicles that are overpowered for one to two out of the seven in game nationswait for everyone to spend money getting to those vehicles and then once the novelty has worn off for playersdo it again It is never a level playing field for every nation One country gets something that completely outclasses every other nationevery patch I'm tired of it and its not funbut I really don't want to give it any more time Can you have fun with this game? Yeahsurebut you probably used to play with dirt when you were a kid and thought it was great tooAnyone with an asterisk in front of their name is a cross-platform player playing on the Playstation 4TL;DR: Gaijin is greedylet's talk about repair costs When your vehicle is damaged or outright destroyedyou will be charged a fee that is paid for with silver lions--the virtual currency you use to purchase vehicles and upgrades The amount you pay will depend on a number of factors such as how upgraded your vehicle is or the type of vehicle it is itself The issue is how nonsensical these costs are and how Gaijin determine them Gaijin claims the costs are for balancingwhich is not only misleadingbut lying to the entire community  It is about profitnothing more Silver lions can be purchased with real money and the amount awarded after each match can be so littleor even negativethat players are enticed to spend money just to afford the new vehicle they spend hours grinding for Players can lose up to 50000 silver lions per match if they don't perform welland that isn't always the fault of skill; it is a lot of the time down to poor game design We will get to that soonbecause it is horrendous A massive percentage of players are terrified of dying and then paying excessive repair costs for that vehicle In ground battlesI recall many instances where 90% of my team would be encamped upon a hill and remain there for the entire match because they didn't want to take the risk of moving across the open field just to get destroyed without getting any score and then incurring the wrath of repair costs My playstyle can best be described as an aggressive brawlerso when I decide to push and battle over the objectiveI will be doing so with only one or two teammates--sometimes none Gaijin punishes players for losing but at the same time punishes players for taking riskswhich seriously hampers gameplay Players no longer work as a teamthey only care about themselves and how many silver lions they will make in a battleagainnot wanting to risk spawning anything to avoid having to pay for the repair costs of dying five seconds in This causes a spiral effect where teams will rarely make a comebackas half of the players in said team have understandably returned to the hangar to avoid those repair costs The newest ground mapRed Deserthas made a lot of good design decisionsprimarily with a mostly symmetrical layout It still isn't perfecthowever Fortunatelyyou can ban maps from your matchmaking You'll be paying Gaijin money to do thatof courseGaijin!"" toxic man-babies The apologists appear to be in complete denial regarding any issue that players start discussingI assume due to the amount of money they have spent on the gamewhich is an amazing case of Stockholm Syndrome On the other sideyou have the toxic man-babies who just want something to be mad about An example of this would be a recent update where Gaijin actually lowered the insane repair costs for some vehiclesbut these people reacted so negatively to seeing ""economic changes"" without knowing what actually changedthat their outrage seems to have panicked the developers into reverting those changes very quicklywhere do you think players will go? Gaijin is out of touch with not only their own gamebut their community too It's an incredible game ruined by greednor do I rarely ever leave reviewsbut they really are going too farOh boyWar Thunder After playing the game a little I wish I could give it a neutral reviewbut as of the current direction the game is taking I will leave it as a negative oneso try for yourself The main issues the game has begin showing once you reach the endgame grind eg Tier V+ The grind has been getting worse and worseespecially without a premium account and vehicles Not only in researchbut also in purchase and running costswhich does not really change the balancebut just makes it impossible to play certain vehiclessuch as Bombersfor prolonged periods of time with any sort of profit As a 100% free playerif the unlocking of vehicles doesn't bring you to a haltthen making enough money to actually play them will do the trickWar Thunder is a fun game that has taken a turn in the wrong direction Not into a Pay 2 Winbut in a painfully slow grindfest which fails to reward players properly for their performance in matcheshas been the Gaijin market What started out as a neat little idea similiar to the Steam Marketplacethe gaijin market moved away from a community content driven storewhere players could sell their vehicle camos and profitto a more intrusive modelselling parts for construction events and trying to squeeze as much money out of it as possiblehellin my over 3000 hours I spent at least 200-300â‚¬ on the game and without regret It is free so whoever is interested should definetly give it a go and check it outbut if you expect to play it entirely for freeyou will be in for a long grind with little rewardAs a player who's been playing since the beginning of Raining Fire (released September 2020) I'm proud and disappointed at the same time of this gamemy dreams weren't focused on the F-4E or MiG-21 variants I stuck to the US tech treeand the thought of just strafing ground targets in a SBD-3 as you fly low to the ground was neverending fun for me I wasn't trying to go grind for top tier jetsI just wanted to have fun with what I hadandas time went onI started to change my mindset to grind for jets That's where my problems beginbut i'm not happy because of the grind Youtube channels rumored a F2P player to finish a tech tree within a year - if they were luckyyou may be wondering ""why did he give this game a thumbs up if i was going to talk bad about it?"" ""what went wrong?""a nice community (no-one really complains about losing or anything or ranting about (X) jet from my experience) the developers are working hard in the midst of the pandemicand morehere's the current problems with War Thunderbut that was extremely hard to a point where I felt the need to buy premium vehicles/bonuses/timethe true reason for Gaijin to do this could be because War Thunder is a free game Because of thisthey have to make packs/vehicles/premium currency a thing so that way they can maintain the servers and keep the game alive Without cashthey can't manage the servers Without serversthey can't manage the game because the servers can't be used Without managing the gameWar Thunder will slowly diecrew trainsresearch requirementsand high purchase costsyou still have to play games in order to get enough currency (Silver Lions) for the vehicle purchase If you have enoughyou still have to deal with a Crew Train (doesn't cost as much as purchase) though poor management of currency can lead you to have extremely low amounts of Silver Lionstanks and aircraft have this system called ""Battle Rating"" They are divided into said battle ratings which fit them best Currentlythe game has stopped at Battle Rating 107 for tanks and aircraft (ships at 60/63)the problems start when the developers add more modern aircraftandif they don't decompress soonplayers may have to deal with F-15s (if they ever get added)F-16sSu-25setc as a F-100 who was unlucky enough to get put in a Battle Rating 107 game F-100s were made in the '50salmost all of the ads shown featuring War Thunder always have a top-tier tankplaneor helicopter (top-tier in the community means modern-day vehicles or similar)saying ""oh what a cool M1 Abrams!

And even steam isn't safe They constantly have people downvote any review that is negative I can forgive russian bias I can forgive the terrible BR system I cannot forgive this company for the way they treat their community To Anton Yudintsevyou made a game that was amazing I loved it so much and always will But what you have become as a company will destroy you in the end Listen to the communitylet them help you make the game better If you do thatthis game has a chance to rise back up into greatness[i]Please read before making consideration:[/i]the mods actively check these reviews and downvote any of them that have any kind of criticism Luckily for usSteam prevents them from just deleting it like they do on their forums I believe the top review here is negativewhich is good despite my review being positive overall People need to be aware of all the faults in this gamewhich are as numerous as all the things this game does rightbut can be avoided entirely - which is what I recommend It's not worth the trouble to deal with the mods if you do or say something they deem critical in any waybut it's something The tank mechanics are very poor thoughbut if you don't mind some occasional RNG wackinessthey are a fun time-killerhappy tanking (and piloting)giving it another shot Same game mostlyjust more monetizationHi Guysmy name is Drake and as of writing this review i have played Warthunder for 32699 hours i have reached the top tier in 3 countries yes after 3000 hours all i have is 3 countries that is WITH premium time and vehicles speeding progression updecently well made but what truly lets Warthunder down is its developersthey do not listen to the players unless they do something so stupid that the whole playerbase revoltslike when they tried to add p2w repairs and boosts for your vehicles they removed the maus with a nonsense excuse that it was ""too hard to balance"" when really they just wanted to make it and event vehicle to make money off people that want it they seed old vehicles that you can no longer get to players in lootboxes that you buy with real money from their rip off Great Value TF2/CSGO marketplace where those vehicles litterally sell for THOUSANDS of real life dollarsthere are still bugs in this game from when it launched like 8 year agothey make players write a fucking essay on the bug for them to MAYBE pay attention to it because none of them even play the gameso they would not knowever ever ever people target the spawn first because its legal with no punishment no ""keep out"" zone10 seconds of spawn protection for tanks60 dollars for a top tier premium (yes they sell top tier premiums) is a little much mannot to mention thaat if you want to progress in any semblance to a reasonable time you MUST HAVE Premium timeinfact you wont even get closeabout a little under 1 percent of players that start warthunder will reach those vehiclesbecause you need millions of total rp (research points) to get themand when you get 2000 rp a game well you see where this is going"
1,"Greetings: My grandson talked me into trying Fallout 4 I'm an older player (65) who enjoys video games I am very impressed with the game overall though I do wish I didn't have the CTD's and other issues with the game But the ability to do the kind of building along with the post war setting has been a lot of fun Being able to enhance the game through the modding system is very nice as well and gives you more hours of play as you find new things to try I have spent hours buidling and actually restarted the game now 4 or 5 times trying out different things I do use quite a few mods and I'm sure the contributes to the CTD's etc in the game I thing Bethsadia has done a great job presenting this game I played the original Fallout many years ago Having learned how to make video's of the gameplay and posting on youtube (mostly for my grandson to see my settlements) has been a nice side benefit of playing fallout I would recommend the game and using modsjust do all you can to ensure things are loaded correctlyI'll keep this shorttribes and groups have a real impact and significantly affect the world;Creation Clubaka: Selling modswork that was free prior to paid mods(And which was taken down and transfered as paid mods as soon as paid mods became a thing) You know what else didn't happen? The ""mod store"" also wasn't infested with a bunch of useless waste of timecash grabshitty ""mods"" that some twat threw together in five minutes /sarcasmI'm so fed up of the games industry right now We've got season passes""remasters"" of games that are only a year or two olda bunch of microtransactions not included in season passes(While being sold and released during the season pass' life)we're also seeing the advent of multiple season passesnot just a single season pass per game but upward of three or more season passes for a single game being refreshed every six fucking months On top of this? We've got lootboxes Lootboxes upon lootboxes in literally every single game being released these days which ranges from shitty cosmetics which used to be free and unlockable to full on items to make your weapons better(Like the old days of P2W in F2P MMO's) You know how far they've gone now? Lootboxespaid boosts and ""legendary"" units/items only obtainable through lootboxesin single player games Yes Single player games now have RNG(Basically gambling) lootbox bullshit in them that give progression boosts Fuck This Shitthe absolute worst of it is the fact that what was once free is now paid(Which seems to be a very common trend these days in the â‚¬60 ""Triple Ayy"" games industry) This is content that makes Bethesda's games what they should have been on release and adds a bunch of QoL improvements that should have been in the game on release and haven't actually been developed by Bethesda Bethesda make the worst inventory systems and have done for years now It's always been up to the community to fix it and make sense of the shitty organisation in inventory across all Bethesda games Nowwith paid modsyou'll be expected to pay â‚¬2-â‚¬5 for a simple inventory QoL fix Likewtf?! You can't justify this crap Let's also not forget the fact that there's no gaurentees that these mods will be supported in the future Sosay you buy a mod Your game gets updated Your mod breaks and the modder who created it doesn't update the mod Tough shit You're SOL and just wasted your money andpossiblyyour hundreds of hours game save that relied on a mod to work Congratsyou've just paid some random asshole and Bethesda to fuck you in the ass and take away hundreds of hours of gameplay away from youbut these things won't be paid mods!"" but they will They absolutely will Give all this shit time and before you know it your favourite inventory mod or travel mod or whatever the hell you like will shift from free to unsupported unless you pay Then we've got the precedence of what it sets for future titles where this shit is baked into the game and there will be no way to support mods outside of itas in Bethesda and other companies will lock down these games so they can not be modded without using their service I don't need to explain just how much of an impact that will have on PC gaming Just remember the amount of freedom as PC gamers we will lose when files and sections of games are locked behind some Single Player DRM which only purpose is to stop people from installing mods outside of the built in ""service""weaponsboosts and whatever the hell else Now every game has a fucking season pass Now most -- at least -- have locked DLC or ""microtransactions"" gated on release unless you ""pre-order"" or pay extra for this shit Just as it was with microtransactions and the warnings we had about that shitfest ten years ago it's going to be the exact same with paid mods If this shit sailsin two to three years time we're going to see DRM for mods(Which is already a thing from the Skyrim paid mods fiasco btw) in every single modthe mod scene move from being as open and dynamic to allow people to create what they want and enjoy to a more business orientated system which caters to those who makebasicallyFotM content What will happen then? No more breakouts like Battlegroundssurvival genresnothing because every single modder and their mother will be trying to cash in on flavour of the month bullshit content with not a single bit of original thought between themnot have others pay for itYeahI've played it for a little bitbut in short: if you don't mind losing some roleplay aspects in exchange for more modern take on combat and a metric crapton of things to dothen I'd recommend this game for you I think this game should be reviewed by listing the goodthe bad and the mixed things individually:vivid and interesting game world so far The Commonwealth has a wide variety of different areas to explorefrom urban ruins and blasted forests to swamps and the horrifically irradiated Glowing Sea The game world is also nicely seamlessso there aren't many loading screens outside of interiors and major settlementsyou can now throw grenades and mines without having to put down your current weaponyou can swing your gun to bash anyone that gets too closeand you're no longer forced to wait until the reload animation is finished before you can switch weapons or access your Pip-Boy In generalthe combat also feels much more fluent and intensebut you can also use the system to make some rather atypical ones - things like  laser autoshotgunsplasma flamers orsayan automatic long-range carbines - without breaking the game balance The settlement system can be used to build anything from a small personal safehouse to full-sized towns with it's own stores and servicesthere's a whole lot to do The base game has plenty of side questsand there are four possible factions you can side with - one of which allows you to spare two of the others if you so please Each faction has it's own side missionssome of which can be repeated as many as times as you want in a new location You can play multiple sides pretty far into the gametooif you're undecided or want to collect several paychecks at once There's also a new miscellaneous objectives systemwhich lets you keep track of minor tasks and clues you've come acrossand most generic location-specific enemies have randomized equipment and loot every playthrough Just about every enemy also has different stronger variantswhich may replace ""regular"" enemies depending on the player levelbut Bethesda also redid every animation from scratch In generalalmost everything from weapon animations to character movement feels natural and smooth New Vegas had terrible voice acting for all but few charactersbut luckily that mistake was not repeated in FO4: almost every character that talks has good or great voice acting (Deacon and Elder Maxson are good examples of the latterbut see the the first point of Mixed section) The soundtrack deserves a special mentiontoo: you can tell it has been done with loveFallout 4 is surprisingly bug free Of coursethere's still a fair amount of thembut they tend to be visual/acoustic rather than crashing or game-breaking issues I don't think I've had more than a few major cases during my playtime that I haven't caused myself with modswhich is pretty impressive considering how complex the game isbut the biggest problem is that each of them only have a brief description rather than the full linewhich sometimes may be something else than you'd assume You'll very likely want to fix the latter with modsso the underlying plot (particularly faction histories and motives) feels rather undetailed in the end Other than thatthe lack of lore is [b]mostly[/b] fixed in form of notes and terminal entriesbut it'd always be better to hear if from characters themselvesthere are only a couple of SPECIAL skill checks in the game (aside from Charismaof course) This feels like a huge unused potentialconsidering that in the previous games abilities like Intelligence and Perception allowed alternative approaches to many situationsbut the rest is generally in the decent-enough category Many would have preferred the silent protagonistand I can see whysome bad For exampleI personally love how power armor works in this gamebut some other lore detail changes (which I will not spoil) seem to pointlessly contradict the previous games Luckilythe bad retconning is limited to minor details onlyI'm against paid modsbut fortunately you're by no means forced to buy anything In factthey seem to give out skins and other small stuff for free every week or twoso you can still reap some of the benefits without actually having to support the business practive whatsoeverI don't think I can give this game a rating that applies to everyoneso let me put it this way:then you might be better off sticking to New Vegas and Fallout 3then you'll probably find this game to be either 8 or 9 points out of 10 For what's it worthI've certainly enjoyed itPaladin Danse looked at the advert for Creation Club filling the screenpocketing the cash and ignoring the damage they'd done""Fallout 4 is really good when you don't have someone in your ear telling you how bad it isI shall start by saying that if you are deciding to buy this game then don't let the negative reviews sway you In generalFallout 4 is an amazing game and can be incredibly fundaysweeks and months from your lifeAutomotron and (first half of) NukaWorld DLC have really good storiesquests and environmentsareas and enemies differentlyIf you're a Fallout fan because of previous stories then you might not feel fulfilled playing this gamehowever if you love character creationslore and immersive environments with untold stories then I completely recommend this game to you2 GB patch to add paid modsBethesda 2015 : ""Let modders fix the game""[h1]Fallout 4[/h1]in relation to the previous gamestook one great step forward technically and mechanically - but twenty enormous leaps backwards in terms of roleplayingwritingdialogueand quests Fo4 effectually forgets everything that fans of the series loved in the originalsNew Vegasand even Bethesda's own Fallout 3; trading that out for an experience more akin to Borderlands than any other mainline Fallout release I'm not outright saying that Fallout 4 is a terrible gameit's far from itbut it's simply not the game Fallout and RPG fans rightly expectedand then you are quickly transitioned to a married couple living in BostonMassachusetts From here you choose either the husband or the wife to play asand then customize the look of your character to your liking After a bit more expositionyou find yourself running with your spouse (your infant in their arms)to a vault as sirens blare that the nuclear apocalypse has finally come Due to events unspoiled in this reviewyou emerge 210 years later - the sole survivor of Vault 111 - on a mission to reconnect with your missing childwho is no longer in the vault when you emergeany veteran of the Fallout series would be able to quickly identify countless problems with it Fallout has always been a franchise about creating your own character who finds their own motivations in a devastated worldwith seemingly innumerable options None of that is true in Fallout 4 howeverbecause the character you play as will always be from before the apocalypsehave had a spouse at some pointhave a childbe either a military vet (the husband) or a lawyer (the wife)and will swear an oath at the onset of the game to find their childwhich should make all other content meaningless until you have This kills one of the most iconic aspects of the Fallout series; player [i]narrative[/i] freedom It's the basis for why I've not recommended this gameas it's the first domino to fall that proves Fo4 is not a [i]Fallout[/i] RPGwhich will be explained furtherbut the lighting(+godrays)modelinganimationand artistic design of the Boston ruins are all visually stunning The game even performs markedly well for a Bethesda titleapart from some FPS drops in the downtown areas There were several bugs on releasebut most of those issues are fixed now For onceI have no major complaints about the performance of a Fallout gamewould be the irrefutably improved combat when compared to prior entries in the series The shooting is now both precise and reactiveand the AI is clever enough to have some self-preservation instincts Most fights are undertaken while exploringand as for the explorationI'd say it's just as good as you'd expect from any Bethesda game The world is full of interesting placesand most of the best moments in the game are bred through this pairing of combat and exploration Howeverthere is one caveat to these mechanicsthe type of design Skyrim had that circled you back around to the main entrance at the end of each interior level This is an okay design choice within itselfbut considering this is Falloutwhere the places you explore are meant to be realistic settingsthe horseshoe level structure gets repetitiveand by consequenceimmersion breaking - early on in the game Otherwisethe broader world design suffers no such gameplay errors thoughis that the power armorcraftingand settlement systems are all awesome Power armor is finally given the depiction it deservesas it's now less of a normal armor type and more of a vehicle that the player drives The crafting utilizes nearly every miscellaneous item from the gameallowing them to be broken down for components to modify weapons and armorand to build settlements The new settlement system is basicbut thematically makes sense in the world of Falloutas it shows people attempting to rebuild civilization and organize societies for their own well-being While I don't agree that gameplay gimmicks are where Fallout should target its energythese systems are well constructed and engrossingnonethelessI'll very bluntly state that the player progression is atrocious The leveling system in Fo4 removed skills from its makeupand now relies solely on the SPECIAL system and perks This is a problembecause the level of diversity you can apply to your character is limited to 70 perks (many of which are boring stat-multipliers)where as you used to have over a dozen skills with values of 1-100which made for incredible variation in player typeas well as more worthwhile perks To compound this issueFo4 almost never provides different solutions to quests and dilemmas [i]based[/i] on the character you've built; making progression pointless in roleplaying termsthe choices are too Wellthat isnâ€™t entirely truesome quests do have a final decision you can make on how to resolve a situationbut in essence you can't choose to [i]be[/i] anything but a constant quest-sponge This is partially due to the aforementionedrestrictive progression systembut the actions you can take are so limiting both physically and in conversationthat you can't kill people you don't like because half of all named characters are essentialand you can almost never turn down a quest in dialogue [i]Player ""choice"" at its finest[/i] Ohand as for the damned dialogueis the dialogue The crux of this issue is the limitations the system imposes by always artificially mandating 4 response optionseven when more or less may be fitting This makes conversations feel inhumanin an uncanny-valley waywhich bleeds into both the personalities of the characters and the depth of the quests Characters (other than SOME companions) are never given the justice they deserve because your interactions with them are so narrowand quests default to almost always being shoot and loot affairsbecause the dialogue is not built for intensethoughtful debates Every roleplaying element has proven to be a disappointmentand Iâ€™ll expose whyEmil Pagliarulois the only person whose job description even partially included writing This illustrates why there is a lack of thought put into the roleplayingdialoguechoicesand quests; as they require a consistent team of [i]professional[/i] writers to construct and ensure each element works in harmony That's what's at the heart of Fo4's troubles in my eyes; a complete disrespect towards writing in any formwhich is what made Fallout what it is todayFallout 4 is a perfectly well designed game on the basis of being just that; a game What it is decidedly not howeveris a Fallout RPGbecause to be one of those you have to actually adhere to what made previous Fallout's so great Those who have not played a Fallout game before will almost certainly enjoy Fo4but as a long standing fan of the franchiseand as someone whose favorite game series was Falloutall Fo4 gives me; is heartaches by the numberAs a US Army Veteran of 20+ yearsgaming is a great way to relax and enjoy some time Fallout 4along with the Mods I usehelps greatly with my PTSD and Depression If this is true for you or simply agreetell others Information will help us all to better understand and reach our goals togetherif you will Weapons selectionCompanionsStoriesand Mods all come together and offer a way to make a differenceeven it is in a virtual world The feeling that comes from reaching goalshelping (virtual) characters ( or killing them) is rewarding and helps me keep a sense of self and a way to simply be happyPeople have demonstrated consistently since Fallout 4's release how dangerous expectations can be To expect great things from the gameand to be disappointed when those expectations are not metis quite normal When judgement is rendered solely on the result of those expectationsthe fatal mistake is made It in turn leads to a propensity for jumping to conclusionsand from that point it's a rapid descent into ignorancemost of the Steam reviews consisted of incoherentfurious ranting that tarnished the whole title after only a few hours worth of gameplay After being shocked by the overwhelming amount of negativityI decided to make my own and openly condemned the bad reviews for what they were: baseless and devoid of perspective It was quite obvious the authors made that fatal mistakewhich is unfair to the many developers who put their soul and passion into creating the gameFallout fans will almost assuredly find disappointments with Fallout 4as did I But if the ignorance of the older reviews and reception of previous games ought to teach one thingit's that those disappointments are no excuse for blind judgement or jumping to conclusions If an opinion is to be rendered of this game in the form of reviewlet it be guided by reason and supported by logic It is in the pursuit of that fairness and clarity that I chose to write this reviewit definitely has its issues Bethesda tried new things in this titlesome more ambitious than othersand not all of them were successfulwhich is further hampered by boring choices and weak voice work Character advancements have been combined into a single perk/SPECIAL sheet Settlement buildingwhile certainly funis mostly aesthetic filler that has little impact on the game world Side quests far too often amount to just killing some mandatory enemiesparticularly with the Minutemen (who are supposed to be the ""good guys"" of this installment)and can become repetitivewhich I found unnecessary and contrary to the philosophy of the series Unlike the previous flawsthis thoroughly irks me I realized that this ties in to the primary weakness of Fallout 4: its lack of meaningful dialogue in comparison to most Bethesda titles Far too oftenyour dialogue choices are shortshallowmeaninglessor all threea lot of which only help you get some extra caps It's not that you should be making major decisions all the time; the problem is that youas a speaking characternow have a voice that carries no power What you decide to say is almost always inconsequential The dialogue system is highly reminiscent of Mass Effect except watered down; the reason it doesn't work in Fallout is that the two games have totally different approaches to conversation The previous Fallout games had much better dialogue options because they meant something Sometimesyour choice of words just made someone hate youallowed you to entice or inspire othersor developed your reputation through the karma system Now that karma is goneyour choices are just that much more pointlessit was an all-around mistake and it sticks out like a sore if you're a fan of Bethesda games or RPG's in general The dialogue wheel system could have worked out just finebut Bethesda carried it out in the wrong waydespite the certain questionable and sometimes idiotic design choices Bethesda made herethis game is still extremely well done I still feel that incomparable thrill that only Fallout can bringit's still an improvement over its predecessors in almost every other way imaginable The game suffers some graphical issues like muddy textures and poor lighting at timeslike any good Bethesda gamebut it's still astoundingly beautiful and even breathtaking at times Movementmeleegunplayand physics are better and smoother than they've ever beenbut it's surprisingly the best one Bethesda has whipped up thus far The suburban locations are more organically dispersed and things become more compressed as you near the cities Streets are narrowbuildings are talland locations are absolutely jam-packed alongside a ton of unmarked ruins and buildings you can enter There are hardly any copy-pasted environments and they all show great attention to detailbut it really isnâ€™t Power armor relies on uncommon fusion cores for power and youâ€™re not an unstoppable god while wearing the suitespecially not at higher difficulties or levels You can acquire some strong weapons like the minigun or Fatman relatively early but finding sufficient ammo is another matter entirelybut it was still a fantastic game In much the same wayFallout 4 is a simplification of the Fallout 3/New Vegas formula and is still extremely good Even in light of its issuesthis game has not been a disappointment at all RPG elements can be enhanced through the wonderful modding community and will eventually make up for some of the game's weaker pointsa perk of the PC version Bethesda hashoweverbeen on a recent trend of simplifying their games too much and I hope they change coursethe negative Steam reviews had me partly worried that Iâ€™d be disappointed but I chose to disregard them and arrive at my own opinion Iâ€™ve learned that nearly every point of contention was blown out of context The few issues that havenâ€™t been redeemed in my eyes still pale in the face of the tremendous work that was done to bring this new and beautiful Fallout world to life I have no doubt that the naysayers worked up their expectations to heights beyond reasonand itâ€™s therefore no mystery that they hit the ground so hard afterwards I chose to see Fallout 4 for what it is rather than what I expected or imagined it to be: a lovingly crafted game thatdespite being marred by some of its shortcomingshas that same engaging splendor that far supercedes its flawsand you wonâ€™t be disappointedeither good or bad[/i]as it was no longer needed Changed some undesirable sentences[h1]How to make Fallout 4 a decent ROLE-PLAYING game[/h1]you want to make peace with all factions? sure go ahead You want to kill every factions and leaving with only you and your raider gangs to colonized the Commonwealth? sure go aheadbutso neat right?Fallout 3: ""Whereâ€™s my father?""you can pet the dogI paid full retail for this game and all the DLCEdit - Dec 4 2015 - Wow this blew updidn't expect 1000+ ratings Thanks to everybody who rated it helpful or not and thanks to everybody for commenting I'll respond to any comments posted here or my profile I also changed my final score of the game in order to clear up some confusionnow that I've got 100 hours exactly on this gameI'm going to do an updated thoughts list This isn't a full reviewjust a list of observationsit's quite colorfulgreatly improved The guns feel like they have power The explosives actually work Melee feels like Skyrimbut it had a few twists and turns I didn't see comingarmor and power armor You can also craft medicines and drugsSuper mutantsdeathclaws etcthen a piece of armor for every part of the body Howeverby about 60 hours playtime I'd already had gotten the best armors and haven't found an upgrade sincezooming in with a scope drops my fps as wellit does well But I think it's focused to much on the FPS and not enough on the RPG Todd Howard said it was an RPG with FPS elements but to me it feels like the oppositean FPS with light RPG elementsthere were plenty of times where I could use my medicine skill to fix (or kill) a personuse my repair skill to fix machinery or even use my skill level to pass a speech check None of this is possible in F4and none of that depth is there The world feels much less alivethey sacrificed features of the gamemainly skills If they still had skillsthey'd have had to record so much more dialogue for speech checks Voiced protagonist also limits the amount of variation the story can haveagain because that would involve more recording See where I'm going with this?but you can be an asshole along the way You will always be a heronot babysit 50 settlementsit was good being bad In 3 and NVbeing good or bad had it's pros and cons With this game there is no such thing and thus a layer of depth is removed from the game The closest thing is that your companions may like or dislike certain actionsespecially if you have the loot perks from the Luck tree I had over a 1000 50 sniper rounds before I ever found a 50 rifle for instance There are a few nice items in shops but they aren't neededat least I already know how to work this minigame I've always thought that Oblivion had the best lockpicking systemyou can't be totally locked outcontroller designed UI Since there are only 4 options in dialoguethis limits interactions options and removes depthyou can't lead whatever faction you sided with They justexist and call you the leader They stop advancing their goalsyou are just given repetitive settlement babysitting quests I've stopped caringtalk to person Maybe shoot them There have been a few interesting encounters but it all feels like busywork This game is actually worse than Skyrim about this since there aren't many different ways to do it because all the depth has been removedthen break Once a piece breaksyou start taking damage to that area However how it actually works is just another layer of armor If you take damagethen you just take less damagethe armor doesn't absorb it all till it runs out of hpthey took 70% of what makes a Fallout game Fallout and threw it away in favor of casualization (to appeal to a bigger audience and thus increase sales) and more SHOOTY ACTION As a shooterthis game is really good As a Fallout gameit falls flat on it's facedecent gear and character customizationlots of exploring and collecting Settlement building Lack of depth as expected from a Fallout title is the biggest flawFallout 76 make me appreciate Fallout 4 moreI have over 5000 hours in this game It is one of my favorite games of all time HoweverBethesda broke my game with their Creation Club content (micro transactions) that they force you to download as updates even if you do not purchase it Bethesda broke my game purely out of extreme greed to get every dirty dollar they could thru pushing micro transactions on a community that didn't want them in the first place I will NEVER buy another Bethesda game againEVER  Also it should be noted since the start of the Creation ClubBethesda has pumped out update after update to add micro transactionsbut they have not onceNOT ONCEput out an update to fix any of the existing bugs in the game that have been there since launchI got a degree in computer science by fixing this game Unfortunatebut the game itself is aight"
1,"I wanted to wait until I had 100 hours into this game to give it a review I wanted to have plenty of time put into it with it being an early access title I've played mainly solomost games like this I dojust a personal preference until I have beat the game This game is an early accessthe only bug I have ran into is an item tooltip describing what the item is The game feels completed even though it is not You canâ€™t say that for a lot of early access games now a daysyou must take it all the way down With you not being able to dig a caveyou must dig the whole area out and build in the area if you wanted to build an underground dungeon for example You unlock building items as you progress through the gameI like this aspectI suggest waiting until the final tier if you plan to build fancy While building you must add supportjust like in the real worldcool concept You must be within a certain distance of a workbenchforgeor stonecutter while building Certain building aspects require a different crafting tablefighting a deer with chains hanging off his antlers while metal music starts playing? Mobs from one biome will fight others from another!

Definitely one of the best games I have ever played!I don't know how these devs did itbut I haven't felt like this playing a game in a really long time It's a true adventureHas more game playless bugsand is polished better than most AAA games while still being in early access I would pay $40 for this gamekeep up the good work devs! My life is consumed by this game I don't remember the last time a game kept me up latecouldn't fall asleep because I was thinking what I would do the next dayand get all my irl s*** done for the day so I have plenty of time to play later on!

They love crafting big housesand slaying the even bigger giants! Wish my late wife could see us all playing togetherValheim is currently extremely popular for a reason While I don't think it's perfectit does a lot of things right that other survival games don't It's surprisingly well thought-through with many elaborate systems in place which make a lot of sense in the context of a survival setting Valheim is a single or online multiplayer co-op survival game that combines elements from MinecraftRustsouls like games and even Elder Scrolls and adds a lot on top of itto round out everything into one game which makes it feel â€˜wholeâ€™ and well designed It constantly makes you think about how you want to approach each of the gameâ€™s aspectswhether itâ€™s buildingcombat or explorationbut long cooldown AOE-Buffs Unlike many other survival gamesyou're not only progressing through your equipmentbut also directly with your characteras almost all in-game actions correspond to a skill that you can level up by simply doing it a lot You need to be careful thoughas deaths become increasingly punishingbecause they will set you back a percentage of your skill progression (and drop all your items in the place you died in) This skill system feels really good in my opinionbecause it offers room for everyoneranging from generalist to specialist and anything in between You might want to be the sword and shield wieldingheavy armor type of playeror you might want to be the sneaky backstabber or even the swift archer All of these playstyles workbut neither of them will be ideal for all the situations the game will throw you into Whichever you chooseso far I've never felt like I had chosen the 'wrong' way to playwhere progression seems completely impossible without putting more time into leveling up some other skill Furthermore youâ€™re never required to reach a certain skill level to do a specific thingyouâ€™re only ever getting better at doing it by leveling up your skillsyou can build nearly anything however you likeshould the grid as well as the half size options not fit your needs The game also actively rewards you for a lot of the furniture and decorations you can build by increasing the 'comfort'-level of your housing Basically higher comfort will give you a longer lasting buff when you rest inside As you gather more materials you will unlock more crafting recipeswhich will make sure you're never overwhelmed with too many options all at once When building a houseyou'll find that you'll have to keep a lot of things in mind First of all structural integrity is not a givenhover over your building pieces with your building hammer to see how stable your structure is If it goes too far into the red it will break unless you build additional pillars or walls for support Other stuff to worry about include the rain putting out your fires and the smoke of fires hurting you if you let it build up in your homeso plan your house to keep stuff like this in mind as you learn more If you're the type who would rather shape your surroundings to your likings instead of adjusting your buildings according to them the game also offers terra-forming options for thatso digging a moat or raising your foundation high above everything else is an option!although some biomes are by design harder to survive in than othersso don't wander into new territory carelessly The game will usually intuitively let you know where you should look for progress nexteither through item naming (For instance if you get a swamp keythat means you can go look for a swamp) or through the tutorial birdwho always shows up when you discover something new that isn't self explanatory Be aware though that building a base in a more dangerous area than the starting one will definitely require you to defend it against foeseither through fighting or through clever base designthe combat in this game It's mostly inspired by souls like gameswith staminablocking and dodging all playing an important part What I like here is that this plays very well together with the skill system in the gameas you will find that certain types of enemies take increased damage from certain types of damage (ie blunt weaponsslashing weaponspiercing weapons) So leveling up your sword and spear skill could potentially help you in some areaswhile leveling up only one will result in the maximum damage from that type of weapon Some enemies will be easier to blockwhile for others you'll want to dodge their attacks (and some are just better dealt with at range) Generally I'd say the combat in the game is funalthough sometimes it gets frustrating to run out of stamina frequentlywhen I saw how well the different aspects of the game work together Craftingbuildinggatheringfightingexploringlooting- They all go hand in hand with each other For instance when you're crafting your armoryou'll find that you can upgrade it with additional materialbut it also requires a higher level workbenchwhich you'll get if you built your home with one or more of the workbench improvements near the workbench You want to gather a lot of wood or stone? You might want to make a cart to drag it behind you and carry a lot morebut first you'll probably also want to have a path so that the cart doesnâ€™t get stuck on every rock or bush There's a river in the way? Build a bridge! But make sure it's stable enough and while you're at itmaybe give it a roof as wellso it's safe from the rain Later you might want to come back and build a better bridge from stone and make a paved road for what might now be an important travel route for you And transporting stuff will always stay relevanteven if you get better methods of transportation a little into the gameso planning for some means of moving stuff around will definitely pay offand the higher you level your skillsthe less stamina your actions will drain However there are a ton of ways the game can make you regain stamina more slowly though debuffs like 'cold' at night or 'wet' during the rain and sometimes it feels slow and frustrating to have very limited actions availablesimply because of circumstances that you could technically work aroundbut more often than not simply end up having to accept Also in multiplayerwhen you'll want to equip like 4-6 people with the latest and upgraded equipment it can take a long time to acquire enough materialsespecially if you're just playing casually or if you don't plan properly Personally I've run into some bugs that ended up costing me a fair amount of progresshowever from what I can tell that bug has been fixed since You should still expect to run into bugs every now and then and the game server can be laggy sometimes Some enemies are also hard to deal with without proper precautions and knowledgewhich I personally think is okaybut I know it will cause frustration to somedefinitely give Valheim a try If you liked Rustbut disliked how easily you can lose all your progress to PVPValheim got you covered If you feel like a mix between Minecraft and Elder Scrolls could be funthat's also a strong indication you'll probably like the game At about 20 bucksI'd say the game is definitely worth the asking price[h1] Odin won't let me go outside anymore and I have Stockholm Syndrome [/h1]I heard about this game a decent amount of people were talking about: ""Valheim""and since I love bothI thought to myself: ""Heylet's give this a try!""I'm unable to tell if that grunt I just heard came from some creature in the game or my own stomach because of the pasta I ate raw in order to minimize the time spent on something else than buildingslaying monsters and gathering materialstime is irrelevant and I could swear the other day my cat attempted to speak norwegian while sporting a fake beard in order to try and get my attention[i] Valheim [/i] is still in early access This is something I genuinely have to regularly remind myself because so farit actually feels like a finished productI could count on a single hand's digits the times I've run into bugsand all of them were minor things that a simple log out/ log back in immediately fixedwith no consequence whatsoeverevery aspect of the game is so polished that when you take into consideration the fact that this is a work in progress made by a small team of indie developpersit's enough to put some of the biggest names in the industry through such amounts of shame that they'd wish they were Activision Blizzard right nowbut what is this game about? [/b][i] Valheim [/i] is some sort of cross between Survival CraftAdventure and Sandbox set in an open worldfight monsters and eventually face bosses It is procedurally generated at world creationwhich means that no two maps will look the samethus contributing to a unique experiencewhich requires materials you'll get from various sources in the world; some of which you'll only have access to after defeating bossesbreaking into their homes and rummaging through the crap they've been hoarding like a real Viking should allow you to catch up on their progression without having to do the exploring and fighting yourself (and possibly ruin your experience in the processas well as earning yourself the title of Lazy Bastard)you have a system of ""skills"" which are improved through pure practice For examplethe more you sprintthe higher your sprinting skill value getswhich progressively allows you to sprint longer while using less staminabut what's so special about it? [/b]like [i] Ark: Survival Evolved [/i] or [i] Conan Exiles [/i] (which are pretty damn good in their own right)you might notice some similarities with Valheim in terms of mechanics and gameplayis either improving on or getting rid of these elements that happen to mostly cause rectal discomfort in other games from the genreonly to be on your way home and suddenly die of dehydration because more than three minutes have passed since the last time you drank?dying 475 more times in the process because some local flock of seagulls have deemed you the perfect sacrifice to their dark god?you only found undisturbed dust and sand as even the scorching sun seemed to laugh at your absolute despair?the game is designed in such a way that most of the frustration you'll experience could only be blamed on your own lack of foresightalthough eating is necessary to increase your health and stamina in order to survive encounters with monsters or sudden falls from steep cliffs [/u]but I'm no one to judgewe've all tried this IRL at least once) [/u]even after a server restart [/u]beds can be placed anywhere and the last one you interacted with will act as your next respawn location until you manually disable it [/u]and at times you may potentially suffer flashbacks from that time you tried [i] Dark Souls [/i] while drunk with your neighbors' newborn baby howling like a tasmanyan devil in the backgroundthere must be at least some downsides [/b]but as surprising or doubtful as it may seemthere aren't many in my humble opinion:even on decent computers This can go to the point of unplayable on lower-end computersas it happened to one of my chums who eventually stopped playing for now because of itturns out I'm just blind) [/strike]howeverthat the game is still in early access at the time I'm posting this review[i] Valheim [/i] is a very well-balanced game made with love and passionand it really showsthis game is [u] gorgeous [/u] You'll know what I meanto when I took a sip of mead as I watched the horizon from the top of my fortress decorated with the heads of their brethrenI enjoyed every second of this journey I'm still far from being done withjust buy the game; I promise you won't regret itfâ™¥â™¥â™¥ GreydwarvesIt feels like playing Minecraft again for the first timeImagine if Rust and Runescape had a baby (without the PVP)we had ZERO bugsthere was about 6 of usand we haven't had this much fun in a game together in YEARSthe depth of the craftingbuilding and the world itself is unrealbut this game is outstanding - truly worth your moneythanks for all your kind words and awardsthis is the first time anything like this has happenedsorry I haven't reviewed every product on my account - I took the time to review this because I genuinely had so much fun and it filled a gaming need I've had for the LONGEST timesense of progression of RustI want the developers and community to know that personally enjoyed it and show a token of supportCan't quite put my finger on why this game is so captivating It has the mesmerising  graphics of ""Among Trees""a brilliant soundtrack you don't get bored with and a nice easy progression to some really brutal combatthey just seem to have found that magic combination Sure it is a little clunky in places but it's really early access and I'm sure in time the devs will sort everthing out and we will have a new Half Life on our hands I love the building and craftingthe devs have really got this bit nailed By the wayI'm 62 and my Wife is 67 and we are both hooked (my battle maiden has her own copy) Well done

or build is made of various materials and using various tools made from those materials You start by gathering branches and rocks from the groundcrafting your first axehammer and weaponwhich in turn will allow you to gather betterstronger and more varied materialfound in areas of increasing difficulty With each material you find for the first timenew recipes are revealed (from your character remembering their mortal life)which in turns will allow you to start gathering your first metal ore[/spoiler] The game is also separated in areas known as biomesand it is implied that you avoid biomes beyond your level You start in Meadows where you will find the first bossafter which you can go in Black Forests where you will find the second bossand so forth There is no physical barrier to those biomes beyond the difficulty of the creatures found withinand you should have maxed out your equipment made from material available in your current biome before exploring the nextmore difficult biomeswhich have no permanent increase The food you eat will increase those base stats temporarilyincrease which will steadily decline over time You are limited to eating three things at any given timewhich must be different You may eat raspberriesmushrooms and cooked meatbut not three cooked meats You will eventually unlock potion crafting made from fermented meadgiving buffs to poison or cold resistanceor filling your health or staminabut none of the weaknessesand it is pretty much the case If you don't eatyour health and stamina will be pretty lowyou won't regenerate your health and will only slowly regain staminabut you won't die of hunger If you want to spend days gathering wood and rocks and building your dream longhousethen you may ignore eating completely The same applies to sleepingbeing dry or staying warm (except for the freezing temperature of Mountain biomesthat is): your stamina won't regenerate as fastbut you can otherwise ignore it if you're not heading into dangeryou'll die If you're climbing on very high rooftops to finish your chimney and fallyou'll die If you explore Swamps without poison-resistance potionsor Mountains without cold-resistance

itfog and weather effects in a superb manner One morningyou'll be welcomed to a gorgeous sunrisethe next will surround the area in a fog so thick you can barely see an arm's length in front of youand the next will have windy showers and thunderstorms It is quite effective at setting the moodbut it will also affect your playthrough When it rainsyou're wetyou don't recover stamina as fast When it's windyyour boat will get damaged from crashing into high wavesthe implications regarding difficulty goes beyond that There are ""events"" of increasing frequency where your location or base gets attackedand the difficulty of those events is determined by which boss you've defeatedregardless of how safe is the biome you've settled in Having boars and necks attack your wooden walls is barely a bother at firstbut when multiple trolls are smashing through your stone walls while you just wanted peace and quiet to create a new architectural monumentit gets annoyingbut polygons and resolutions are old-gen lookingreminiscent of late PS1/early PS2 graphics if console gamers want something to compare Of coursethis is an Early Access titleso a stable game with solid and fun gameplay is more

For examplehistorically the UK managed to keep on top of basically all sorts of aircraft designsship designsmediumlight and heavy tank designs (plus associated TDs)infantry equipment designsand various secret projects like RADAR and nuclear weapons. In game there just isn't the capacity to do this. You're likely going  to likely only research one type of tank (light then medium)one type of bomber (probably CAS or TAC)and probably fall behind on capital shipsdue to the lack of research capacity. I have so far never bothered to even research scout planes because it feels like the research slot is always better deployed on something (anything) else. I think there should be some more ways to specialise national research. In HOI 3 this was through the research organisations giving particular bonuses. I think this should make a comeback via the 'concerns' in the politics menu - these already offer some bonuses in some cases but I think this should be extended greatly. I also think they should be easier to appoint earlier so that you can specialise earlier. Perhaps appointing your first concern for an area should be cheaperbut changing later more expensive.production even for very industrial nations like Germany doesn't feel strong enough to keep up with all the options. This obviously needs to be a limiting factor as it was historically but usually it just doesn't make sense to build any of the more esoteric unitse.g. swimming tanksor self-propelled rocket artillerybecause throwing factories at infantry equipment is so much more important. This leads to most nations playing the same - build infantry equipmentsupport equipmenttrucksartilleryfightersCASmedium tanks. Deviation is a great way to run out of equipment and lose the war. Obviously these pressures are key to how the game worksbut it feels like there needs to be some sort of system to encourage diversification. Perhaps for examplefactories could be more nuanced than 'military' or 'civilian' - a light arms factory is very different from a car factory. Perhaps a car factory could be re-purposed to produce vehicles but not guns.and managing your forces is so much easier. No more screwing around with endless levels of military hierarchy and hundreds and hundreds of generals who all become interchangeable anyway. Here there are only four levels - divisionarmygroup and theatre - and you assign generals to armies and Field Marshalls to Groups. Similarlywhile in HOI3 manageing your airforce was such an enormous painand the effects of air superiority so minor that it basically was not worth ithere air power is much much easier to control and project and will be central to your overall strategy. Navies have also had a makeover although I haven't yet played any major sea power so won't comment on their effectiveness.here each division requires particular equipment dictated by its design as well as time to train. In terms of equipment they need gunssuppliesartilleryanti-tank gunsand particular vehiclesall of which need to be produced by your production lines which you set up and control. The way that this equipment is then handled means that upgrades are simulated much more realistically. In HOI3 a brigade used the previous technology until 100% upgradedand this made no sense: your Panzer 3s had little percentage meters which when filled magiced them into Panzer 4syour infantry used 1936 weapons until every single 1938 weapon they needed arrived then switched. Here divisions use whatever they can get from the stockpilemeaning that your divisions take delivery of new equipment as it arrives and replace losses with whatever you have available. So for example if your tank production doesn't keep upyour panzer divisions will fill the missing slots with whatever old crap was sitting in the depot. Oh and about that time to train - if the Motherland needs divisions comradeyou can simply hand them a rifle from the pile and point them at the Germans...it's a bit too keen on them) so Britain doesn't sit around uselessly unless player controlled. It's also much better at manageing forces and maintaining a front line so it's not so prone to huge encirclements. It seems to handle terrain better tooand pick good places to push and excellent defensive positions (which can grind things to a halt). It also seems to be a lot less predictable and capable of pulling off some rather complicated plans - I sawfor exampleJapan launch an enormous pincer maneuvre on Chinainvading from both the North and South and cutting the country in halftrapping most of the Chinese forces out of supply. It's had some problems in the past with over-committing on low priority fronts but it seems to have improved in this regard in recent patches.in my opinionthe WW2 grand strategy game. I keep coming back to it and lose hours every time I do.SoI decided to go with Luxembourgsince heymight as well try something hard right?thinking I'm too weak and pathetic. Then it all began. I swore vengeance on those damn imperialist. I began to plot my revenge. I hired a fascist demagogue to change my ideology while rushing nuclear research despite the massive penalties. After a succesful coupor as it will be known in Luxembourgian history - unification of my people under one banner I joined the Axis since both Germany and me had mutual enemies. With their help I was able to unite the Benelux region under my rulegaining more precious factories and people to force into my legions. I helped the mighty Reich in conquest of Francebeing rewarded with another small chunk of land. Everything was going according to my plan. But then a certain Austrian thought it'd be smart to attack the USSR. At first everything was finebut thenoh god... Then the blasted British landed troops in France. So here I was facing the hordes of imperialist pigs while my best pal was off in Russia causing havoc. But I knew what I had to do. I had to stall them as long as  possibleand that I did. Eventually Italaians and few Germans came to help and the British advance was slowed down or even halted at times. Goodgoodjust a bit more time. I'll show those islanders how ""weak and pathetic"" I am. I'll show them. In late 1944 the first nuclear bomb was produced. But I couldn't drop it without air superiorityso I waited and built up more airforce to help the Germans win the air war in the regions. And the help I provided proved very significantthe might Luxembourgian air force dominated the skies and allowed me to drop my revenge. Oh what a wonderful sight it was to see London in ruins. Does this seem weak or pathetic to you? Does it? Thought so.

1,"I'm 64; this is my first RPG. It's great. Certainly not intuitive for a guy that's never played anything like thisbut I relished the challenge. I had no idea what I was doing at first: I died many timesand progressed slowly. Used Google for UESP for game infoand that helped tremendously. I made it to Level 83sort of ran out of things to doso created a new characterand am playing it differently. I'm a Stormcloak this time around. Enjoying my second go round immensely!Original versions here if you want to get it due to it being hidden on the steam store.If you want the original Skyrim game + DLCsi dumped sven's body in a river and found him in eastmarch 10/10Here are the original versions (with Steam Trading Cards) if you want them:Things I've Done in Skyrim (In no real order):so I switched sidesbut told my son he couldn't have onecupsforksspoonsbowls and jugs of milkTodd?If you want OLDRIMhere: https://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/people can see.Skyrim in 2020Got depressed and played 61 hours in 4 daysGame was and still is so coolbut what's more remarkable to me is how easy is to look for/install/use the mods this time.sometimes due to my lazinessbut this game has quite a few excellent modsespecially if you are looking for a nice immersion and realisma couple of things that you couldn't find at the original skyrim. This mixed with the new graphics from the special edition makes it SO enjoyableeven when you role-play warming up for 5 minutes next to a fire pit.shadowsetc.you can even freeze to death and rain makes you be wet and get colder fasterthis is why i got this modwhich shows me the way to every city at every crossroad.but just what is necessarynot plenty of them.something that makes kind of sense.to drink and to Sleep is now necessary and rewardable.like Morthal or Dawnstar.meaning that you don't need to walk around all skyrim to sell the stuff. (1000 septims was humiliating for a merchant TBH)pretty simple but cool enough for me.it's weird not to see any battle along the way until you join one of the sides of the war. With this mod you can find these fights while you walk around. Make other kind of patrols availablelike the dawnguard.something that i still don't get why it wasn't allowed in the original game.avoiding to search for the damn horse every time he flees from a battle.an ingredient that was so hard to find and wasn't allowed (don't know why) to make it out from the normal tusks.i got them in this order and all of them work properlywhich leads me to my final advise: Download the mod ""noble skyrim"". Improves SO MUCH the city textures and buildings. There's just one problemit has been ported to special edition but still remains on original skyrim from nexus: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/45807/?wait till it's completely ported to SSE or download it manually from original skyrim and install it manually from Nexus Mod Manager as well. It won't show up on the listbut it will be thereso don't worry. There's a patch as well to work properly with SMIM mod (Static Meshes).and i found it on nexusmods.

Legendary.[h1][u]TLDR:[/u][/h1]go buy Skyrim Special Edition. SE is more stable than LE because it is 64-bit & DirectX 11 while LE is 32-bit & DirectX 9 [b][i](in layman's terms: You will experience fewer crashes on SE than on LE)[/i][/b]. And if you haven't played Skyrim yetyou have done well to avoid Todd Howard for 9 years (and counting). Amazing first time RPG experience & one of the biggest modding scenes to date leading to potentially thousands of hours of replayability.you are free to roam the map of Skyrim as you please. Visit various undiscovered map locations teeming with wild and dangerous enemies both human and non-human. Build the character and play style you want to: become a mage and harness the powers of destruction magic to burn your opponents alive or manipulate their minds with illusion magic; or become a fearsome warrior who travels the world in heavy armor and swings a mighty axe to decapitate everyone in sight; or let's be real and accept the reality that in every playthrough you will somehowwhether intentionally or notend up playing a stealth archer build who abuses the vanilla sneak system and headshots enemies from a mile away without being detected.dynamic DOFand environmental effects. There isn't any brand new vanilla contentbut the land of Skyrim sure looks better in vanilla SE than in vanilla LE. The game has a big map filled with different landscapes from grassy plains to bustling Nordic cities and of course snowy mountains that seem to climb all the way to the stars. There is plenty of variety in the world of Skyrim: different weaponsarmorswildlifeenemy typesdungeon types etc.[b]vanilla[/b] SE runs much better than LE and is practically crash free since it isn't restricted by a small memory block like LE (that is not to say that the game [i]won't[/i] crash if you mod it with 400 mods).if you don't like something about the graphicsthe issue is easily fixable through modding (replacing texturesadding new visual effectsadding an ENBetc.).you find yourself as a prisoner in classic Elder Scrolls fashion. For some reasonyou are on a cart heading towards a chopping block where everyone in the cartincluding yourselfis about to be executed. Your execution is rudely interrupted by a renegade dragon who mysteriously attacks everyone on sightbut fortunately it grants you freedom. After escapingyour story is up to you to make or discover.open-world where one tagline for advertisement was ""if you see ityou can go to it"". In most casesthis is true (so long as you are within the map of Skyrim's borders). If you see a mountain in the distanceby all means you can probably jump your way up to it. Thusthere is a large amount of freedom in the game for you to go wherever and do whatever. It is highly likely that you will stumble upon something interesting while straying away from a main road or following a divergent path away from your intended destination.you are (for the most part) free to leave and return to the quest at your own disposal in the future.just do Skill x-related tasks and your levels will improve. Just consider not playing a stealth archer for once. Or don't.someone probably made a mod for it. Whether you want to retexture a cityrevamp the game's perk systemadd a custom followeror change all dragons into Macho Man Randy Savagethere's a mod for nearly everything imaginable. Ask anyone who has modded the game and they will probably tell you ""I've spent more time modding the game than playing it at this point"". Mostif not allmods are available in both LE and SEand certain mods are still in the process of being converted from LE to SE if they haven't already been converted.the combat of Skyrim is pretty awfulparticularly the melee. Close-quarters melee combat doesn't feel impactful in that generally you swing a weapon at an enemy and unless it is a power attackyou won't really get a reaction out of them like a wince or a flinch. The melee feels very ""floaty"" and otherwise unimpressive.you have to go back and figure out which mod was the cause and why that mod specifically is the problem. You shouldn't expect all mods to be compatible with each other so oftentimes you have to decide which mods you want and which mods you don't need.but differently each time as people continue to make mods for the game and you continue to add to your modlist and get sucked back in for one more playthrough.I only wrote this review for awards"" is a waste of everyone's time.

I recommend this game to literally everyone. I even have a tattoo on my left arm of ""Fearless"" in Dovazhul (dragon tongue).2013my first time playing Skyrim:I was attacked by a group of vampires. I managed to stave them offbut I contracted vampirism without realizing it. About a week laterI came out of a dungeon only to be attacked by some peasants calling me a vampire.I went to Whiterun in search of a cure. Howeveras soon as I arrivedI was met by a volley of arrows being showered at me by the town guard. At this pointI had done some quests for the companionsso I made a run to Jorrvaskr in search of someone who still may be my friend. The guards chased me throughout the citywith several of them hot on my tailI burst through the doors of Jorrvaskr and met the companions. I was never so happy to hear Njada Stonearm call me useless. This feeling of relief was short-livedhoweveras a company of guards suddenly entered the room. My friends all drew their swords and came to my defense. After a lengthy battlethe guards all lay dead on the ground.all of the companions went outside. Wondering where they were goingI decided to follow them. As I stepped outside into the harsh sunlightI witnessed a massacre. The companions were murdering every hostile NPC in Whiterun. Heimskr was the first to fall as Aela rammed her sword straight through his gullet. The rest of the townspeople fled in terrorbut it was no use. BelethorAdrianneeven Nazeemthey all were mercilessly slaughtered by the companions.I found a single survivor: Brenuinthe town drunk and one of my only friends in Whiterun. He was hidingcrouched down next to the cow behind a house. I decided to sit down next to himwhen I saw Farkasaxe in handcoming into the pen. With a deepgutteral voicehe says""Where are you?"" he turns the corner and sees Brenuin cowering behind the cow""Ha! Found you!"" he yells.but it's too late. Farkas's massive axe comes down on Brenuin's skullsplitting it in twoas the drunk falls on the floor in a puddle of his own blood.I've Bought this game six times.

allowing you many possibilities for ideas for role-play and creating a story in your head as you playin my first playthrough when I first joined the demonic Sheng Xing Hong (Holy Star Rainbow) sect filled with many demonic characters despite my own character's somewhat neutral disposition Thereimpressed by my performance in the sect's entrance duelsone of the sect seniorsthe venerable Kang Qin (70 years old) offered to become my master I accepted hoping to receive guidance and training of the martial arts of fingers and lightning spirit arts But my master rarely checked on me as he was far too busy getting his ass handed to him by other righteous sectsand especially kept getting defeated by his rivals and enemies To make matters worseother members of the sect and other acquaintances kept coming up to me and badmouthing my mastercalling him despicableevil or hypocriticaladvising me to break ties with him Of course being a neutral fellow my character was I just agreed with all of themmaking many friends on the way at the expense of my Master's notoriety One daywhile I was breaking through the Foundation stage of cultivationI received news that he was finally slain by his rivalwhom I never even met before Come to think of it I only met my Master for a second time just after the entrance trials where he told me to work hard on my cultivation and development of my skills And so was the rather hilarious Master-disciple relationship between meYu Tuo the agreeable fellowand Kang Xinthe old timer who kept getting humiliated by literally everyone around him including his own discipleXiahou Hanyun Intially she invited me to some leisure activities in a nearby pavilionand was impressed by my art of gift giving and defeating and sparing a rival of mine (who killed me twice before and was quite shocked by me being alive after she slit my throat) who insulted her and my appearance (despite my high appearance stat XD) From then onwe coincidentally met a number of times and grew in amiability Somehowshe ended up as the sect's leaderand named me an honorary disciple as I moved on to another region to further my cultivation One thing that was very interesting was how Xiahou Hanyun had more of a demonic alignment but somehow still clicked with my slowly growing righteous characterwhich opened up many possbilities for thinking about their relationship I simply just explained it for myself that my character was a very carefree fellow though and my own character was not really as amiable to her as she was to mine (perhaps due to the fact that I kept giving her cultivation breakthrough materials that I no longer needed) My character and Xiahou eventually tied the knot in a snowy village of Feng Kou (Phoenix Mouth)and that was the start of all the badmouthing by strangers and other acquaintances pertaining to her demonic alignment What is even more hilarious to me is how the righteous sect I joined later gained me a few female admirersand when one invited me to a pavilion for leisuremy own wife came to find medemanding an explanation Thankfully she did not think that it was my fault and developed a grudge and enmity towards that female sect colleague who invited me there Such Shurabareminiscent of bullet hell games like Touhou Project (but thankfully very much less intense) - it allows a bit more room for customizationoffering you up to 4 different moves that have procedurally generated stats and effects alongside equipable passives that boost your abilities alongside pills you can buy or make yourself (which can be more potent than those available in shops or stolen from people) This system lies on top of 6 different martial arts (swordspearbladefistpalmfinger) and 6 different spirit arts (EarthWoodWaterFireLightningWind) - which have various types of moves eachallowing you many possibilities to mix and match and create your own build One lost opportunity though for builds which I hope the developers add more on is the cross compatibility of moves from different martial arts and spirit arts which only seems to apply to defensive passive skills for now which means that if you stick to one artyou will most likely only use that for the rest of the mid to late gameI was satisfied with this level of combat which provided indeed some challenge especially when fighting bosses mid-gameand sometimes beating a character whose cultivation stage is higher than you (which is often very difficult) using your own strategic build can be extremely satisfying A word of advice to those seeking to fight those of higher cultivation level - focus on dealing damage + criticals + optimize your build to activate Divine Power immediately as they can deal a ridiculous amount of damage even to higher level cultivatorsthere are still a lot of systems still not present such as FengshuiTalisman makingTool CraftingSect Management (sadly you cannot become a Sect Leader yet) etc that will be slowly updated as the game takes shape So faras it is I highly enjoy this game and am around halfway through (Hua Shen stage)and the gameplay loop is fun and challenging enough (at mid-game especially) The music is decentand the artwork is very nice to look atespecially the world map cells which unfold like a neat Chinese painting I will perhaps update this review again when I am completebut if you read Chineseenjoy a good Xianxia novel or comiclove thinking about the in-betweens of character interactionsand love that neat random generation in roguelikes then this game is for youDON'T KILL PEOPLETHEN ITS OKAYrandom people who attack yourandom near dead guys who seem to always attack if you help themetc You kill a guyhis entire goddamn family will inexplicably instantly know One of them will be stronger than him They will never forgive you no matter how many times you spare them You have to manually buy their forgiveness 1 at a time while under constant attack Kill the dude who is 1 step above the first guy?

A perfect game with exciting future potentialif you are watching this single reviewplease keep adding the contents for higher cultivation like Gods and Immortals found in the novels nowadays I want to break through a realm to become cannon fodder again in a different world where even janitor is stronger than me and rise again to beat those pesky maggots as I did in my old worldjust like the never-ending novels where the main character is just never enough powerful Please make it happen; many more fans of the genre will come here if you can do thisEnglish translation is dopeand it is great that this time it was not botchedand there are many fans of this genre rising throughout the globe; you guys will not be disappointed with the sales if you can tap into themWhile I'm recommending this gameits mostly down to the fact that its an indie game that is being developed with good care by the people behind itand because has good playtime to price ratio There's a lot of replayability in here which can allow you to tinker with various different builds The base foundation of the game is looking solidand I'm writing this while keeping in mind that its still in EAand there will be more stuff addedthere are some points I didn't likeas is pretty much bound to happen in most games Here they are:or from trying to be a do gooder and be in everyone's good gracesor trying to woo  every lady you meet (hark all ye harem wuxia novels out there :D) That saidto me at least there are two things that are most important in any sandbox game to feel worthwhile long term:no matter developed by a small or large number of people The two things sound simple but I'm sure anyone can imagine how difficult they would be in practice since they basically have limitless scoperealistically speakingwhat I can expect is that if I am a Grand Elder in a particular sectthat some pipsqueak kid of one of the disciples does not come to attack methen get defeatedand then threaten me that if I kill himhis mommy (who is just a pathetic little disciple in the sect) will ""deal with me"" Not going to happen kiddoand who is killing whom despite the said fights happening in the middle of nowherethere's heavy rng involved in particular thingswhich just multiplies the grinding exponentially Now I don't mind grinding if it is fun But here it is just too repetitive to be fun There will be a lot of loading screens you'll have to go through if you're grinding a particular realm or for artifactsand the fact that this game has a moving timeline which saves every monththats also like a loading screen in itself considering the time it takes to make the save and give all alerts for the monthbut the game is still EA and translation is being worked onso I'll hold out on that Considering this is first cut translationits quite good I was hoping this would be the wuxia / xianxia game that would hit the sweet spot for mebut it wasn't to be Lets see thoughthere's more to come hereand if they improve some of the things mentioned aboveit could get close-ish for meå¸Œæœ›èƒ½å‡ºä¸ªMACç‰ˆæœ¬"
1,"Devplease hire a team This game is not allowed to perish under the physical limitations of a single human trying to work on it Brilliant but needs aggressive expansion before it disappears from people's radarsI love it Kinda seen everything in it butI enjoy it Multiplayer games tend to have a short life span (Particularly Indie ones)directly related to the player base If this goes one month without *Content* updates (which is very very very likely to happen) players will drop ituninstalland find a better MP game to stay on It's a huge task to keep a MP game alivebut one can only hopethis might not be the best place to express concerns There is a discord https://discordgg/QxvWuqX which is very active AlsoI understand that they update the game for bugs and fixes on a daily basisbut I am referring to content because that is what keeps players engagedhere is the Trellofor anyone who is interested in what is to come for this gameTeammates left me in a roomsaw a deformed child running at me and disappearspent the next five minutes sitting in a corner with a crucifix Highly recommendTutorial tells you that the ghost isn't violent but I'm still too scared to complete it anywayPlaying soloI load up the school map for the first time I stop and appreciate how big and unnerving the map is I check my equipment I look around some more I realize that I'm putting off going any further The phone down the hall rings After changing my pantsI start to hunt down where the ringing came from All the way down the hallhuh? But the front door is all the way over hereand ohfine I track down the roompull out the EMF meterwhich immediately jumps to 5 I throw down my bookask the ghost to write in it (wellwhat came out was ""Okaydothethinghurryup"")then sort of moonwalk my way back down the hall while chanting variations of ""Nope"" One Alt+F4 laterand I'm here writing this review Nothing even happenedI simply psyched myself out Now that's a horror gameBetter basketball physics than any NBA 2K seriesI asked where the ghost was""the ghost only respond when you're alone""First time getting chase by a girlWhen you have to go in alone to talk to the ghostand your friend watches from the van :(- Give us a signGhostThis game is extremely fun to play Luckily my friends and I were looking for a co-op horror game right at this time and I stumbled upon this game None of us regret it one bit It's very promising for an early access gameit doesn't rely on them very much at alland instead relies on the natural tension of largedark areas and the natural activity (or lack thereof) of the ghost in order to build suspense This meansfor me at leastthe feeling of dread doesn't end up wearing off and I can still feel genuine fear when going on a new missioneven if I've been there 20 times beforewhile also letting those jumpscares still be somewhat scary A win/win in my bookbut boy was I wrong It creates a great experienceactively speaking to the entitytrying to provoke it to show you what it can dorisking your life for the missionbut it's gotta be done It's thrilling and fills you with dread Having the mission react to the things you say is extremely immersiveone of this games biggest strengthsis huge in this game I always feel like I could actually be in the level Especially if you are playing in VRit's hard to be ripped out of the experienceeven if you're fucking around with friendslike I was Being able to be the one in the truck tracking movement and and activity throughout the location is just as thrilling as wandering the house itself looking for activity It's been hilarious and immersive the several times my friend got impatient waiting for clues and went into the house to insult the ghost only for it to immediately lock the door and begin hunting him 10/10as the game basically JUST came out as I write thisand I have very little to complain about and feel very positively about this game and it's futurebut these are things to keep in mindand that they may and will likely change in the futureyou can hold a video camera in your hand and carry it aroundand others can have a clear view of what you're pointing it at as you move through the house I would like to see this also become a feature for desktop playwhile you still can equip the camera and view itthe angle is very low and bobs sporadicallymaking things hard to see You can buy a headmounted camera that I assume fixes this I am not a high enough level to buy one yet so I'm not surethen but them on your belt to use them hands-free I would like for at least the EMF reader to do something similarinstead of turning off when you put it away It makes a noise when you get a readingand I think that could staywhile requiring you to pull it out again to see exactly how strong the reading isI feel that would be a good compromisemy only 2 concerns right now are 1 placing cameras Currently you grip them by the left or right side in a set directionand it's only different for each hand it's held in It can make it difficult to place a camera facing a set direction I would like to be able to grip cameras from a front angleas well as from the topin order to make placing them much easier And 2 switching handscurrently you have to drop an item manually and catch it if you're fastor pick it up off the floor in order to switch hands if you don't have room in your belt Many other games allow you to grab object out of your other hand and I feel it would be very helpfulkeep in mind that I'm writing this in very early accessso I expect this to change at some point Currentlythe only missions are identification Go infind cluesdeduce the ghost typeleave I Don't have a problem with map designbut I would like to see other mission typessuch as full on removalas the game talks about youthe identification teamdoing the research for a future removal teammissions like that would be great Another is finding out how the person died and became a ghostthe journal mentions a few times about death and people becoming a ghost Finding clues about the death of the ghost would be a very interesting mission design and I'd love to see it come to lightwith my current understandingit doesn't matter until you hit 50% at which point the ghost becomes more aggressive against you This on it's own is interesting and can be useful for drawing the ghost outbut I would like to see moresuch as hallucinationsboth visual and auditory There's not much more I can say on thisanything I could is just as obvious as that so I won't botherand againexpect changes to thiswhen you dieyou become a ghost and wander the map as an invisible entity I think this has a lot planned for the futurebut currently that's all there is to it I think it would be extremely interesting if you could interact with the world in a similar way to the spirit your team is still hunting Things like flicking the lightswriting short phrases on wallsor maybe being able to speak in a ghostly filter for just a couple seconds to give them a cluewould be very fun and make it so you're not just a passive and clueless observer if you are killed If done in a way where it isn't always clear if the interaction is between the hostile spirit or your fallen friendit would be possibly the most unique thing I've ever seen in a co-op horror gamethis game is a steal at it's current $15 priceand I got it on sale for less than $13! Even if you want to wait to play it when it's more developedpick it up now!

1,If i was going to die and the make-a-wish people camei'd wish for the world to have Left 4 Dead You can easily get hooked on this game and play forever. 5 out of 5 stars.Still one of the best games I've played but seriously... learn how to count beyond 2Valve.You never really stop playing Left 4 Dead 2. You just take long breaks that last up to a few years before coming crawling back....Every steam library needs L4D2.I've greatly enjoyed this game several years and thousands of hours later.this game hardly loses its appeal.No loot boxesprogress baror unlocks. Just straight up fun gameplay and reliable game mechanics.  Another classic must-have game from Valve. Yes people still play this game in 2021it is still relevant and worth buying!It's not about killing zombiesit's about protecting three idiots that do everything in their power to die.This game has no unlockable itemsno upgradesno skins.Before i played Left 4 Dead 2i had a small wee-weeno friendsno girlfrienddepressionand absolutely no life. These things haven't changedbut the game is pretty good.æ¸¸æˆæ˜¯å¥½ï¼Œå¯æƒœæˆ‘æ²¡æœ‰æœ‹å‹Game came out 12 years ago and is still goated!I really need to stop downloading addons.What can I say? It's left 4 dead 2 for fuck sakes! This and Left 4 Dead 1were by farmy most favorite and most addictive games I ever played on Steam! They will forever go down my heart as my favorite zombie game.before they went shitty lol)After playing this game since 2010i have found myself coming back to it time after time againit's a nice casual game-Left 4 Dead   Please?---{Graphics}---The zombies die when you shoot at themL4D plz
1,"My Tottenham team bottled it in the final and Bale spent 6 months injuredbrilliant improvement from fm20but bring back the name of the player who made the assist after a goal!!So realistici'm in 2030 and spurs still haven't won a trophyMy wife left me.As alwaysthe newest version of FM is bit better than the earlier one. I have played since 93 I think and still enjoy the game. HoweverI don't purchase every new FMonly every second. Last one I played was fm19 and fm17 before that. It seems the developers are bit lazy for bringing in new features and removing or fixing features that don't quite work and therefore getting every second new version is enough.they don't budge at all. They offer something regardless of how well you have managed the team and asking even ""one tick"" more results them just offering the original sum until you either accept it or don't get new contract. So you can make the team best in the world winning CL many times in a row and the salary stays at the sameor you leave. Just a minor thing but annoying.they should have little more effort than just updating the databaseConcede 95th minute equaliser[list]90% of people who play FM buy every game anywaybut I thought I would do a little writeup of my thoughts after playing about 400 hours since I got 21.[/b]and thank you for the awards/votesi just want people to be as informed as they can be on a game i play so much.[/i]but it is totally unrealistic to simply have an exact percentage figure on how fit/sharp your players are.and football in generaljust look a lot better in this engine. In every previous game if you looked closely there was always something robot like about the players' movementand glitches with ball movementetc. I find that watching football in this engine is so much easier on the eyes in this gameit gives you a good idea of what a club wants for a player that is usually more accurate that your scouts' ideaespecially if they simply say 'don't want to sell'it will also give you an idea of how much the player actually wants to join you and whether contract negotiations could realistically succeedit's clear and conciseI really hated the pre-match tactical briefings from fm19/20thought they were completely useless.but I simply cannot be bothered to gesture to the media to try and make them feel better.I think most players found the old UI perfectly usable and the new one takes some getting used to and doesn't have the same level of ease of access to information.but no advice on how to create schedules for youth.it's pricey and not much changes year on yearbut realistically there isn't much more you can really add to a game with this much detail in it already. If anythingI would like to see multiplayer be focused on a bit more by the devsbut the singleplayer product is still great as alwaysand you can easily sink hundreds of hours into this game without getting bored. If you are a newer playerI would still recommend this gamebut only if you are willing to spend time learning about how it works and how to get the best out of your team/players.[/b]please read this section [/h2]you will need to do a lot of researchso [b] I have written this brief writeup for newbies [/b]as well as research onlineto get the most out of it. In terms of downloadsfacepackslogopacksskinsand kits are all things you'll want to download and install to make the game look & feel much better and more realistic. I've realised that if you're a newer player to the seriesthere is so much stuff that you'll need to look up to get the most out of the game. Stuff like downloading training schedules and learning how to make your own is really important for player development. Some elements of tactics such as team fluididy aren't really explained that well in-game and are much better explained by people on the sigames forums & other fm sites. In-game shoutstoothese only affect player morale and don't affect your team's tactical approachbut this isn't told to you in the gameyou'd only know if you researched it. Personalities of staff & players are also [i]extremely[/i] important for player development & performancethis isn't emphasised in the game at allbut I would 100% recommend googling a guide to player personalities in FM21. Alsocreating good views (ie. squad views) is really important to getting the most out of the game and getting information on players quickly. I have a squad view on my workshop page which I find really helpfulthere are also many others available.I would recommend these sites for downloading add-onsand advice on tactics and making the most of the gameas well as asking any questions you do have SIGames forumsFMScoutStrikerlessguidetofm.compassion4fmsortitoutsi/r/footballmanagergames2050 Still no Super League. 10/10I finally upgraded to FM21 after skipping FM19 & 20 - mostly it was the xG feature that piqued my interestbut I also like to update every so often for little things like competition rule/qualification changesrefreshing rostersetc. Coming from FM18I've been pleasantly surprised at some of the new features added in FM21 - not only do I really enjoy the xG thingI love the overall improvement in what I'd call ""realism"" The interaction with staff continues to get better and betterthe way staff and management present you with reports and call meetings is awesomeand the scouting meetings before transfer windows are so damn cool. It all combines to make you feel like you're actually a manager and not just playing a game. I'm at around 230 hours of FM21 and I'm still constantly finding myself engaging with new things.I'd just like to share my experience/thoughts on scum-saving. For the most part during my thousands of hours of FM over the yearsI felt like I was pretty fair about reloading matches - I only tended to do it if I had a bad injury to a star I'd just signedor conceded a BS glitch/bug goaletc. Sometimes if I was having a bad day and fired up FM only to be down 4-0 to Man City in the 35th minute I'd just Ctl-Alt-Delete and replay the match a few days later. But with my new save in FM21I've been experimenting with a strict no-save-scumming policyand it's added a whole new compelling element to my gameplay. I had a real stinker of a game against Newcastle (5-0 I think) - the sort of game I'd have been tempted to reload in the past - and a day later my players refunded the supporters' tickets for the match. How cool is that!? I also got to within one bad result of getting sackedand had to get something away at Sheffield Utd - what a nerve-racking match that was! My boys pulled out a 3-1 win to keep me aliveand we had a short run of good form to finish the seasonallowing me to get the transfer reinforcements I desperately needed.I felt it was well worth the money to upgrade from FM18 to FM21and if you've never experimented with a no-save-scum policy - give it a whirl. I think you'll find it rewarding.---{Graphics}---This game is like a toxic relationshipno matter how many times it hurts meI just keep coming back to it.This game made me fail school and collegethen it got me fired from my job. It also ruined my marriage. 10/10.Gone from a 3 bed detached housea promotion and new wife. To a bed siton the dollbut with a Gillingham side sitting just outside the playoffs in the Championship.Been playing FM since 2016I have thousands of hours in the game over the last 5 years. I am extremely confident in saying that this is the best FM i have played so far. The match engine has finally been overhauledgoal keepers behave like real people rather than Octodad in net. Players will make intelligent passes and decisions in the final thirdand finishing has been vastly improved.I'm a long time fan of SI's Football Manager games. They are by far the best in the market for football managing sims. Unfortunatelyyears have caught up to the software and it evolved into something else.huge props to programmers having to deal with 20 years of legacy codedubious frameworks and all other challenges of preserving and upgrading this enormous project. Development cycle of these games isn't long enough for meaningful changes and bug fixing. It's very hard to come up with something newimplementing it and having it completely tested on a yearly basis which could lead into things getting very stale and unexpected exploits appearing. There are also problems bleeding from one yearly version to next and so on.or sometimes need to bring something new each yearthings get overly complicated and some features get gutted. For examplein older versions corners were overpoweredso to make them more realistic we now have set piece routines that need to be set up before every single match if you want to have a chance at scoring them. Of courseyou can save those routines but they are dependent on your players that you rotate almost every single match every season. Training was very simple and somewhat effectivebut to add some sauce it got reworked and now it's kinda impossible to mold players to your willimproving specific attributes needed to take them to a new level. Meanwhile AI has almost free reign in developing their wonderkids. ""Realism"" is used at will to justify many creative decisions. Yet FM presents unrealistic scenarios all the time. Not only in match enginebut for example with man management. Would a player with loyal personality throw a fit after bid from a barely higher reputable team gets rejected? Would professional personalities try to turn whole dressing room against manager for not getting a contract they required with astronomical demands? To me at leastfun is much more important than the realism.if that's how you wish to manage. As time passes the games sadly boil down to recruitment (having better players than the rest) and going through the same motions which is inherently the biggest flaw of designing games like these. Unfortunately they will eventually become a chore regardless of how fun the challenge started.you will have to deal with disgusting demands of players and AI teams. AI teams will lowball you when buying and rip you off completely when selling. AI teams will trade fairly between themselves and players will accept much lower contracts compared to what they demand from you. Worst part is that other teams will destroy your squad harmony and upset your biggest performers in order to buy themonly to not play them more than 10 games over 3 years before selling them on a bloated contract.so they can blast a cross right into those defenders leading to corner number 53.yesbut the amount of control and systems is simply very high and to play optimally you simply have to utilise them allyou could simply stack as much Brazilian and Argentinian wonderkids as you want. To nerf thistheir wonderkinds became much more expensive and luxurious. So to bypass thisyou simply resort to buying cheap ColombianPeruvianChilean (all other South American really) and Eastern European wonderkids.whole squad will turn against you.morale and player personality systems being completely out of whack. Get out of CL groups as an Eastern European team for 4 years in a row? Say that your goals is getting out of groups again in team meeting and they will jump their gunsget abysmal morale and whatnot thinking it's unrealistic. Every player no matter the personality is just a mercenary that will turn heel at first chance. There's rarely one club players among talented wonderkids (possible if you are 5 star reputation team)and the only thing personality can tell you is how likely will those players improve in the future (if they have potential).scouts' judgement of players ability and potential gives almost exactly the same reports when that grade is above 9.you will be punished. Defensive tactics are terrible in this installmentleaking goals left and right with not much to offer in counter attacks. Yet AI perfectly parks the bus when it needs. Pre-made 4231 Gegenpress simply stomps the game.sometimes not even drawable. I've tried replaying those more than 20 times with many different tactics and results would be similardespite my lower level sides managing to beat stronger opponents only months prior.replaying them will have wildly different outcomes.but from FM19present even today in FM21every time without failon a day 2 days away from a matchdayat least one injury occurs. Micromanage every player's trainingoverloadrestwhatnotevery timeon a day 2 days away from a matchdaydreading message appears in the inbox informing you that at least one of your players (even U19 are included in this black magic) got injured and won't recover in time for said matchday.van DijkMahrez aren't possible as every player's ceiling is determined when they are created. And their development is over when they turn 24. Achievements do not lead to stat improvements which I think should be a feature. It's even realistic...please help me quitunrealistic gameFM > PES or FIFAHaving taken a World of Warcraft sized break from FMI grabbed FM20 cheap at the end of the game cycle and recaptured the addictionleading me to FM2021.but for the most part they are minor and related to my own personal idea of sim vs reality. The engine is the best its been in the versions I've played since 3d became a thing. It has some quirksbut most of them are down to the engine showing a player acting a certain way but the visual representation isn't realistic enough to look at and say""I get why he did that"". For examplea player may not react to a ball over the top as swiftly as you would hope and it seems like an oddity of the enginewhen in fact its down to the player not having high enough concentration or anticipationso by the time the ball is in the air he's reacted too slowly and moved toward the ball when its already heading over him.so I'm still shocked when I finally hit the quit button and the time isn't 11PM but 3 AM. If that isn't an endorsementI can only imagine you're completely unfamiliar with the franchise. To any FM veterans (or CM old guys like myself) that have not yet dived inmy advice to you is this Order a weeks shoppingkiss the family goodbyemake sure the pets have their care accounted for and click BUY.FM20 Demand More"

1,"I was looting the barracks in Zelenogorsk when I hear a gate being opened behind meI turn and see a well-equipped player dealing with a zombie I have a gun in hands and the advantagebut my entire current playthrough has been rather peacefulso i opt for a non-violent solution I duck behind the corner of a barrack and yell over direct chat that I don't want to kill himand i circle around a stone wall trying to avoid line of sight He answersbut it is intangible I can't see him anywhere but I assume he went to the barracks (1st person server btw) I try my best to not get in an awkward position and run up into the second floor of a house overlooking the military site By the time I get there i can see that he has indeed closed the door in the prison buildingbut fuck it I run up to the prison building and say I'm friendly and just wondered if we could do some tradebut I'm determined that my friendly intentions will serve me wellI enterhe is pointing at the door with an AUG It's when i get closer to him that i see a second man with an AUG in the staircase I explain what I'm trying to get and mid-sentencea friend of theirs come in He was likely watching the entrance After a little meet&greet the say 'sorrydon't have any mags' I say that's okayand we agree that we wont go the same direction afterwards lest we run into each other againsomewhere in the forestI'm shot in the leg Pants ruinedbut legs not broken I very briefly get some vietnam-level flashbacks to the time my roommate taught me the basics of ARMA and combatand I jump behind a tree instead of just turning around I count down from 10 and regain my breath My M4 is equiped with an ACOGand the shooter must have been about 100-150 meters awaymoving as quickly and safely i can while preserving breath I finally get to him and see he's unconsciousdonning a black skull balaclava I'm angrybut not disappointed this is the nature of the game While i still have him alive and able to hear meall i can get myself to yell was ""I TRUSTED YOU"" before I shot him Looting his bodyI find 3 ak74 magsan ammo box full of the right ammoan LRS and some decent stores of food All in allmost intense thing I've had happened the last few months1 load inPretty funbut very sad Met a Russian guywe became friendseven with a language barrier We played with each other for a while Then I got shot in the head And I never got to see him again If you're out there man let me know I miss youI entered a house looking for some food when I heard some footsteps outside The guy said hey and entered the houseI said hey backand he hit me with a hammer This was the beginning of a beautiful talethe tale of the Shoe GangI finally stopped and turned around to see if I was being followed by the crazy hammer man As I stood therehungry and demoralisedI heard ""behind youbehind you""and up came running another playermuch friendlier than my previous encounterand he charged off""Let's get this mother fucker""we ran at the hammer manwho after seeing our number had doubleddecided to take a more diplomatic approachand explained he simply wanted my shoes for his friend Little did he know that I had just found the most pristine pair of shoes in the house where we first metthe three of us teamed up in search of the finest shoes for the hammer manâ€™s friend We searched high and we searched lowbut there were no shoes to be found Finallywe met up with the shoeless manwhose shoes certainly were in a state of disrepair Unable to tolerate the toes of the bare footedthe four of us left town and made our way across the countrysidewe encountered another survivor He had a nice hatbut we weren't there for hats He was clearly uncomfortableand he was right to beas the hammer man had been stashing a secret pistol this whole time We were explaining our need for shoes when the hammer man went for the killthe gun went to the back of the manâ€™s headhammer man pulled the triggerand he completely missed the shot Listening to hammer manâ€™s accent he appeared to be Frenchwhich for mean Englishmanexplained his inability to handle a firearm at 3 centimetresand the rest of us piled in with our fiststurning the guy in to a battered mess We were careful not to hit his shoesbut it turned out that he too was wearing worn footwear Howeverit was enoughand our friend fitted the loafers over his aching toeswhen the guy I met after the hammer man announced that his shoes were now unfit for purpose Our thirst for shoes was not yet satiatedand we moved on in search of the next pair of clogsmy new friend had to goleaving myselfthe hammer man and his friend to fend for ourselves The Shoe Gang were hungryand so we holed up in an abandoned house to hide from the rain that had started to fall and munch our way through some beansand we pushed onthe scent of leather driving us through the forests We took part in some fishingsat round a fire cookingand discussed our shoe filled fantasiesthe sound of wolves filled the air We were outnumberedand our shoes were worn out They were upon us in the blink of an eyeflailing his gavel relentlessly as the beasts took him I attacked the alpha wolf with a big stick which only seemed to anger him Soon everything began to fadethe blood loss was traumatic and I slipped in to darknessand I have no doubt that they took all of our shoesVery Positive @ $15 Mostly Positive @ $25 Negative @ $45[b]This ""game"" sets a perfect example of how to do everything wrong in software development[/b]please keep in mind that this - like any other review out there - represents my _opinion_ about this game and mine alone Since the game is still in developmentmy criticism is mostly pointed towards the acutal development of this game rather than the game itself There might be a one in a 1000 chance that I might change this review around by the time the game gets officially releasedI've given up hope on this We (my family) started playing about 2 years ago and it really wasn't bad back then Of course there were bugsthings were incompletebut that's to be expected from an Early Access gameas I've been closely monitoring the development progress of the gameI see so many things going wrong in the development teamI almost feel the urge to take a planefly there and put some people in their place and teach them a thing or two about prioritiesthe game is far worse than it was 2 years ago In a long period of timeBohemia managed to keep implementing 'content' to keep the players happywhile they should've been working on engine-related systems instead [i]Now they have to ""refactor"" every single piece of content to make it fit with the 'new engine'[/i] As an engineer myselfI know how much time and effort this takes The person responsible for prioritizing content over enigne should be fired and never to be allowed in game development againyou might notice that the team works in an agile method using 'sprints' We do the same in our office Howeverusually there is one person responsible for prioritizing tasks and planing them ahead This person clearly thinks from a business perspective instead of something to improve the quality of life of the software (maintainabilityeasy-adopting and stability)and it hurts me to see this happen to a studio like thisa lot of much better alternatives got released in the meantime I'm not here to advertize or suggest anything in particular since I gave up on these types of games after the horrible taste in my mouth that this game gave meI'm guessing there is less than a handful of actual programmers on the teamfloating/flying buildingsetc)you bloody FIX ITto answer the question if I would recommend this game to ANYONE:here's the proper way to ""port"" a game to a different engine:the DayZ mod for Arma II)go early accessAND NOT BEFORE THAT!implement content - finish the gamepeople with absolutely NO EXPERIENCE in software engineering in general had leadership over the development of this ""game""big kudos to the team that's been there since day one All the negative crap they get over themselves right now would completely ruin any form of motivation to even keep working on the game for meI have owned DayZ SA since it was announced I bought it the instant it came up for sale on the steam store Before thatI played hundreds of hours in the various modsmost of that was due to the time I spend commiserating with friends when the game didnt work as intendedwritten reviews about this game for the subredditargued with peoplegone back and forth between loving and hating itno faith in the devs and renewed faithwhen they announced that the game would be LAUNCHING out of EA at the end of 2018I was genuinely apprehensive and unsure as to the future of this game At that moment I knew the devs had lied to ushad lead us onand ultimatelyhad no intentions of finishing this game in the way that was promisedvehicles have ALWAYS supposed to be in the game For the first 2-3 years they were NOT in the game The game was barebonesand when they finally added vehicles they were broken in the same way some of the mod cars were brokenbroken Vehiclesbroken Hit detection during firefightsbroken Inventory system is such an obtuse mess its BROKEN Core features of this game remain in limbo and as you play you'll find that you're jimmy rigging and finding loopholes to combat the broken features just to get them to semi-work in your favordid you read to comprehend what I saidor just skim past and find all the bits that made u mad?the modding scene for SA was just starting to really take off About 6 months after that and its now thriving - mods make this game playable I've said that from the start It's all I played during the first iteration of DayZit's all I said would save SAand thats exactly what happenedThis game has been in alpha for 4 yearslet me tell you what I did in four yearsa cook and a security officer for 3 different companies6 Years ago I bought this game It was shitty and full of desync and bugs And yet everyday I found myself playing for hours upon end The reason thousands of players just like me keep coming back to Dayz is for the amazing player interactions and experiences Its unlike no other game I have played 6 years ago I met 5 people in a town called elektrostill play with them to this dayand a couple of months ago I got to meet them in person while attending one of their weddings I will always come back to Dayz because there is simply no other game like itgrind for 10 hoursdie in 10 secondsEDIT:  READ UPDATE AT THE ENDyou

1,"My entire colony was saved by a tortoisegoing over the pros and cons Rimworld's a story generatorso I thought I'd share my story I bought rimworld around two weeks prior to writing thisand set up a small colony The first animal my colonists tamed was a 212 year old tortoisewho I named ""Old Timer"" We set up a small farmand once we found a female tortoise (who I named ""Henrietta Peach"")they had kids And their kids had kids Soon enoughI had too many tortoises than I knew what to do withso i tried selling themand the nearby colonists loved them But things took a darker turnmy IRL dogof 15 yearspassed It was sadbut what hit extra hard was old timer's death only a few hours later Both were blindboth had bad backs - it hurtand I cried I dug a big tomb in a mountain for old timerand laid him to rest in it But this is not where his story endsI got a quest with a ressurection serum as a reward In that momentI knew what I had to doas the end goal of my playthroughbut I sure as could save this turtle Old timer was going to spaceI needed a way to keep old timer from dying all over again while I aquired the supplies for the ship Luckilyan ancient ruin was on my mapand after an intense fight with some killer robotsI safely placed him in a stasis chamber the robots were guardingand over the four or so years it took me to complete the shipold timer's children numbered over 500 i made regular trips to the nearby towns to trade tortoises for the ship's supplieslike plasteel and uraniumand at long lastI placed old timer in the now-finished ship and turned the reactor onrimworld basically becomes a sort of wave defense gamewith a new posse of enemies coming every day for 15 days or so while the reactor charged This wasn't a big deal - I had troops in power armor with minigunsand we made it to the end of the 15 days without any deaths Right as the reactor was at full powerand I told my colonists to enter the shipthings took a dramatic turn A solar flare knocked out all my defencesleaving me without any kind of fire support I hurredly got my colonists in the shipbut right as the last one was making his way across the fields to get to itwhen salvation came in a way I hadn't expected: A tortoise (number 493to be precise) didn't take too kindly to someone coming out of the sky and attempting to shoot his keepersand bit a pirate enforcer on the leg This caused the pirate to hit him with his cluband after that the OTHER pirates started shooting the hundred or so turtles in the basewho promptly attacked back Andin the ensuing chaosmy last colonist boarded the ship and we escapeda blindcrippledundead tortoise repaid me for saving his life - by birthing countless decendants to not only fund my escapebut who also protected me in my darkest hour of need This game is a giftand I cannot reccommend it enough Even if you reload saves to keep the story going how you wantit's still a story worth tellingFull underground basechemfuel stored in a granite room with no cables in the walls so I figured it was safea Zzzt event set a colonist on fire who fled into the chemfuel stockpilethe stockpile exploded destroying the wall between it and the hallwayeven the coolers caught firethen the food caught fire The communal hall included all the hallways that went throughout my base (ironically to make temperature control easier) so there was no way to get out of the base other than to go through the communal hallthree caught fire in the halls before reaching the shelter of the adjacent roomsthose already in those rooms caught fire as they were dying of heatstrokethe communal hall reached over two thousand degrees CelsiusI still get misty when I remember my pet raccoon Willy  Willy had already lost all four legs defending me from prior attacks by bandit raiders  We came under attack again and the raiders made it inside our base and a bandit cornered me in my bedroomI was finished for sure!  Willy wriggled on his belly across the floor and bit the ankle of the bandit who began shooting at Willygiving me time to charge the bandit and take him down but Willy had been shot!but he was critically injured and dying  We rushed Willy to the medical bay and managed to stabilize him  Not only would Willy livewhile in surgery the doctor was able to attach four new wooden peg legs!  When Willy was awake and healed he was able to scamper across the potato fields on his new wooden legshero and protector of our village![b] I felt like I had to share my experiences with RimWorld so far 	[/b]Ashton (a quite ironical name in the end ) The basic needs were all coveredeveryone had a nice place to sleepdecent clothingenough to eat and time to relax The people of Ashton were prosperous They lived in harmony with nature and each other Their wide fields provided them with plenty of food and they sold the surplus to the passing by caravansthe Pig Face Menattacked the settlementbut the people of Ashton were saferelying on the strength of their automated defence systems And so the colony grew and I thought: This is itI finally have a colony which doesn't collapse after a few hoursmost were friends and there even was a married coupleTali and Waltzeating only those animals which died by natural causes (eg old age or other animals)so the animal population in the near forests remained stable So far so good But taking those dead animals in meant of course someone had to leave the safe area of Ashton and wander through the wilds Normally that wouldn't have been a problemeveryone was equipped with guns and armor of the Pig Face Men so they were quite ready to take on anything coming in their waywhen a tortoise nearby turned mad I thought okthose aren't that fastWaltz will be able to safely carry the chinchilla inside and the turrets will take care of the tortoise [b] Nope!	[/b] I'm not quite sure what exactly happenedmaybe this animal was on speed or something like thak Anywaywhen it saw Waltz it charged at him at a horrifying pace Waltz had just lifted his weapon when this damn creature reached and hurt him badly Howeverits hard shell was no match for Waltz' gun And so he came back homeinjured but happythat now there was even more meat than expected But the wraith of the tortoise was unforgiving The bite wounds in his upper body infected themselves The medical treatment didn't work and he got weaker and weaker If the infection at least would've been in one of his limbsthat might had saved himbut you can't just amputate someones chestthe infection overwhelmed him Talihis wifecarved his story in the sides of his sarcophagus The burial ceremony was heartbreaking Everyone had come: Talihis sister Juliahis friends VasJonesStephanBoyd and LeiaVas' tame wolf Nevile and Bacon 1 and Bacon 2 In the light of the evening sun they all waved a last goodbye to their fallen husbandbrother and friendbefore the people of Ashton went to bed With Waltz dead or notthey had to cary onnot very surprising if you think about it There was only this one little problem: She was a pyromaniac When the rest of the colony sleptshe left her big and empty bed Driven crazy by griefshe did the only thing able to ease her pain She set the forest on fire Finallyexhausted almost to unconciousnessshe fell back into her bed againthe otherswaken by the crackling firedesperately tried to put out the flames which already started to spread over to the buildings But they simply weren't enoughthey could either try to save the buildings or the forestnot both Of course they tended to the buildingsto the food storage to be exact However it gave the fire the chance to spread through the forestcompletely sorrounding the settlementJones and Boyd followed when they collapsed in the infernal heat And thenwhen no hope was leftthe godsthe ancestorsthe Flying Spaghetti Monster or whatever thi people of Ashton believed inheard their cries Rain started falling downputting out the fire But it was too late More than three quarters of the colony had been taken by the flames VasStephan and Leia were unconcious Julia was the only one still able to stand She did what she couldbut with all the medicine burned she had no chance Leia died firstVas second This caused his wolf Nevilewho had been laying loyal by his sideto turn mad like the damn tortoise and he ripped the still unconcious Stehpan into pieces before he went on attacking a herd of muffalos (some kind of marshmellow like buffalos) which was his endwho managed to flee when Stephan was killedwandered through the burnt ruins of Ashton Blackened stone walls and pieces of charcoal everywhere All the food they stored for the winter was gonethe fields empty With no medicine left and her own wounds hurting worse and worseJulia found a last smokeleaf joint in one of the destroyed buildings She leant against her brother's sarcophagus and lit it So she didn't feel anything when the Pig Face Men attacked With the solar panels a loss to the flamesthe turrets didn't react when Ashton's last inhabitant finally exhaled her last breathIf you're thinking of buying this gamestop hesitating and purchase itimmediatelyas a 74-year-old sociopathic scientist called Geckulon Decktar; I researched robotics to begin withand constructed some automatons to handle the menial tasks like cleaningcooking and haulingetcleaving me free to conduct my research All was well- until a band of savages laid siege to my settlement I barely survived- but resolved to increase my securityinstalling several auto-turrets around my perimeter This would keep the ruffians at bay for a timebut I needed a longer term solution- so I turned my focus to bionic enhancementsI did not hesitate to inspect their wares I wanted a slavebut not just any slave- he should be forebodingbrutal and utterly without mercy! And that was when I found him His name was Skint Mcgruff He was a feared crime lord when they captured himinfamous for killing and then devouring the people who wronged him I paid the slavers their due and took Skint in I fed him (alasnot the human meat he desiredbut nutrient pastemade from potatoes- poor farebut such is life in the frozen wastes) and I clothed himand so I presented the idea to him the very next day He was keen- particularly about the notion of having retractable claws- and so the work began My medical droid handled most of the surgerybut I crafted the bionic components myself It was a long and grueling processbut eventuallyhe was complete More machine now than manI felt it necessary to rename him to symbolise his departure from prosaic humanity to something moreand thus I named him CANNIBAL (Cybernetic Armoured Neutraliser with Neurally Integrated Bionic Attack Limbs) He is my pride and joy bionic eyes that can see even in the darkbionic legs that allow him to sprint faster than a cheetahand retractable claws with which to tear out the throats of my foesand of courseI give him leave to feast on their corpses afterward as a rewardI can finally conduct my research in peaceNine cats wandered into my colony and I was happyskinnedand cooked eight of the cats to survive out of desperation and I was sadcausing a fire that killed the final cat and I was angryLet's say you capture a prisoner after a bloody raid on your colony Do you want to:what else do you need in a game?I've played RimWorld for [i]easily[/i] over 1000 hours aside from the 160+ hours on record for my accountI really should have reviewed it sooner since I've played it so longbut I never got around to itso this'll include my experience in the gamewhat's good and badand everything you'd likely need to know before getting itit's very interactive and you'll always have something to dobe it planning a new room for your basebuilding up defensescreating a more reliable food source or even raiding enemy factions At first it's very daunting as there is a lot to get used tobut each new discovery comes with a new way to experience the gameyour story is always your own and it'll never be the same as beforelending this game to nigh-infinite replayabilityand that's not even considering mods which are abundantrelatively easy to make yourself and very active The developers constantly revise and improve aspects of the game improving it more and more as time passeseven your own ideas may be implemented if they're good additions to the game The community is one of the best I've seenwhere people joke aroundshare their playthroughs and wacky happenings whilst generally having a good time I recommend this game if you like strategytackling positive/negative turn of eventsplanning thingsand sandbox style survival games If you're still on the fence for buying the gamewatch a 'lets play' video and see madness that can occurcheck out all the mods that are available and imagine the possibilitiesit really is a great gameat first it may be a turn-off but the style works well with the gameplaywith the attention you need to pay to so many things on screen it's good that the textures aren't complexas it'd strain your eyeswhereas this style is soft on the eyes and doesn't impede the gameplaythings represent what they're meant to beand it's surprisingly easy to get immersed into the game with the simplistic graphicsthere is no set storyso things can go in any directionyou could have a trader caravan arrive to sell items just as a raid occurscausing a massively shoot out between two major groups just outside your baseafter which you can mop up all their valuables and turn their corpses into meals and skinmaybe for that human leather hat you've always wanted Perhaps you start brewing beer only to have one of your pets drink some and get addicted to alcohol Story is incredibly well done in this gameand with how fun it can be I'm surprised lots of other games don't use the same stylethe sounds work for their intended purposesthere's nothing spectacular to talk about nor is there anything uniquethe sound it has is rightbut it's not something the game is well known for and isn't made to contribute a lot to the gamefor the style of game this is (a sci-fi colony sim) I'd say the gameplay is near perfectand it can be perfected to a player's liking with modsa lot of features from popular mods are incorporated into the game over time so the base game's gameplay will get even better over time Things are placed using the UI at the bottom of the screenand your colonists with build them if they have the resourcesthey can get the resources from your setting up of work orders (like cutting down treesmining rocksbutchering animalsharvesting plants and various other ways) It's almost like you're the architect of a colonytelling them what needs to be done and when it needs to be doneit's quite nice as luck is a big factorbut foresight allows you to somewhat control your luckand mitigate disasterthere's little that's more satisfying than diverting misfortune with a well thought out plansome change the game entirely (like changing the space-cowboy style theme to that of Lord of the RingsMedievalWW2 era and many others)whilst others change / add to the games features and toolsallowing for you to adjust anything you don't like into something you do likeand the modding community is quite activeif there's a good idea for a mod then it's likely already madeIf you choose to buy it then I recommend trying the base game without mods firstas whilst they add a lot to the gamethey also take away from the main themeplaying it without mods will help you understand the fundamentals a lot quickerbut how they come together makes it a 9/10 for mesince RimWorld is the best game of it's typeI've looked long and hard for other games like itand Prison Architect is the only game similarbut to me it doesn't have the random glory that RimWorld has RimWorld is certainly worth Â£30hell it's worth Â£50+ to me since I've got so much entertainment out of itother games you may play for 200maybe 300 hoursbut this is one of those games which you can sink months intoand games like that are worth buyingI don't often write reviews but this game is just so good that I can't help but share my opinionI've been playing this game for the first time and I want to share the story of how I realized it's kind of amazinga female trader named Onesandied nine years after founding the colony The story of her life on the planet is what amazed me and it convinced me this game is something special It actually made me a little emotional None of what I'm going to say is fakethis all happeneda 16 year old K pop starand her best friend Augusta miner Min died early on from injuries she took during a caravan ambush Barely a year later August bled to death from injuries she received during a very bad pirate raid on the colony Onesan broke down often in the early yearsSteel Onesan and Steel had a very rocky courtship They went through two years of awkward back and forth flirting before Steel finally won her over But after three years of marriage Steel was seduced by another colonist and Onesan separated from him Despite Steel's cheating she never broke down again She couldn't afford to She was the colony's lead trader and negotiator She was always busyconstantly on the road between her colony and the friendly one nearby During the periods when she wasn't on the road she tailored clothes for the rest of the colony Steel stayed on his side of the colonyworking on his armor and weaponsSteel broke up with the other colonist while Onesan had been away on her last trip Steel and Onesan got back together and for one more year they enjoyed each other more than they ever had beforefar away from the colony A large pack of manhunting arctic wolves entered the map almost on top of her Onesan was ripped to shreds and bled to death before Steel and everyone else had even left the safety of the walls to go save herOnesan deserved the best possible funeral A catacomb was excavated for her deep inside the nearby mountain and a solid silver sarcophagus was placed inside for her to rest in Steel constructed the sarcophagus for his wife personally It was excellent quality5509""but Onesan's death did not make Steel upset I know she was important to himthough He would leave his work at the machining bench to visit her sarcophagus all the time He'd always be there for a long timestaring down at it I've been paying closer attention to him since Onesan died and as far as I can tell he hasn't flirted with any of the other colonists since her deathslowly unlocking the path to the starsbut instead of going with them he will stay behind on the planet to be with herDon't get into moddingi have 52 cats every winterwe run out of foodand my colonists starve the cats eat their bodies and last long enough until the next summer if we are lucky a raid of many tribal men will arrive and the cats will have food for months the cats have kittensand then we have more cats and need more food i do not think we will leave this planetthe original pet of the colony has been made fully bionic and will now never die he is our true leaderHeavily recommended game! And the following play-through should make you either highly appalled or very interested:but later on my pet monkey took a liking to another guy named Bones It made me a tiny bit sadmade the entire surroundings and buildings out of the easiest findable supply around: woodso he was always running around naked which was not appreciated by some But apparently he had a passion for farming and was well endowed Greta took the earliest opportunity and showed him some loving Greta was listed as a lazy and weapon hating personbut not too lazy to chase down some 'bone' Good for hernamed Adantewas a tireless fat miner and the other two people named Dorothy and Hunter were your average run of the mill converted prisoners from earlier battles Dorothy could cook up some decent meals and Hunterwellas the name implieshe was hunting down the animals for the food to make nice meals mixed up with the harvested crops from our farms Luxurious and plentiful meals of variety Even salt was added for flavourthe pet Monkeyand I did not notice as I was looking to mine some shizzlethe pet monkey had all her limbs bitten off by the snake and was crying for help while still being pounded by the Cobrabut heyhe loves being naked and probably didn't want to risk being bitten in dangling places so did nothing to help outhowevereventually shot & killed the cobra before it could put a killing blow on the poor limbless cryin' monkeycarried and put in Bones' room to keep him comfortable with some painkillers while we figure out a way to get his limbs back There are ways in this game to do sobe it four wooden pegs or made out of other technologybut it takes some craftmanship to pull this offan electric storm came down on the settlement as if it was telling us: YOUR INTENTIONS ARE NOBLE BUT THE MONKEY MUST DIE!here's a lesson I've learned: Never make your ENTIRE settlement out of wood)and spread from the storages and houses straight to the farm area (and all over the entire mapall animals and trees on the entire map were burned alive)the house in which Butters was still 'recovering' was also hit by the fire I sent my main character Adante to help out but the fire enclosed the area in a rapid speed My fat miner and his slow jigglywiggly runs could not win that race by a long shot He was a haulernot a speedy gonzalezthe poor cursed monkeyjust shrieked and screamed her lungs out when the fire was getting closer and closer after every secondwe could hear the cries againof a pet Monkey Not only in pain from snake bites and losing all limbs beforebut now also jumping by the belly up & down inside her once comfortable pet-bedbeing on firesince he's supposedly the new master of Buttersgo into the flames and try to retrieve the monkey while the plan was to let him carry the monkey into the water at a nearby lakewhile both being on fireinto (what it seemed) a neverending sea of flames and emotionI stopped playing and told the story to my girlfriend Her eyes opened wide and then the question came: ""What kind of f***ed up game is that?""my dear It's Rimworld -true story-I've been fiddling around with challenging game modes rather than the stock three So I began a game with absolutely nothing other than the starting colonistno foodno weaponno silver I've then opted then to go for a mountainous region cause it's easier to defend from attackersnormally what happens now is you get to choose your colonist I thought ""Righti want a good minersomeone who can farm relatively well and I guess a good fighter to start off with"" Off I go cycling through the colonists where I stumble upon Patrice Patrice was shit at everythingI'm talking zero'sone's and two's across the boardwith the exception of Art which was seven and Social which was bloody eighteenhow the hell does she have such a high social skill so I read her backstory Now Patrice was just twenty years oldvery young but she had done so much Patrice wanted to sing for everybodyluckily for herDad was the CEO of an interplanetary corporation and set her up as a Childhood Idol Patrice sang her poor heart out for everybody and made her parents proud Until her mum dieddad was beside himselflost in his thoughtsPatrice at this stage was developing into a woman and 'offered' herself to dad as a replacement for mum which he accepted""Give us your daughter or we go public with what's been happening between you tworuining both your lives in the process"" Dad agreed and sent poor Patrice awaywhere they used Patrice for a new kind of jobif you know what I meansay hello to Patrice's adult background Pornographic Idol Yes you read that correctlyPatrice was now sold into sexual slavery But it wasn't all that badshe wasn't a typical 'whore' as it wheremore like a Companion from Firefly where she selected her clients She became very popular amongst the nobility of the region Attended balls and had a cult followingmuch like her childhoodI had to try to help Patrice live a better life Off we went to Patrice's new home I'm assuming at this stage she's been rescued by some unknown benefactor AnywayPatric lands right in the centre of a small clearing surrounded by mountain with only one opening and fertile land within that area too ""Score!!"" I thought as I got her to work setting up a shelterbed and torch Bloody hell wasn't this a task for her? It took two days to complete this menial task but together we persevered Eventually she completed this task cutting down a dozen trees in the process and skilling up two levels in construction""Crap"" I had to get her to safetyfortunately this rabbit tired itself rather quickly and left Patrice alone after it slept I got Patrice to fashion herself a club to use and just in the nick of timewell I say nick of time but it took her a whole day to get this done too At this stage she hasn't even gotten to setting up a farmluckily there are heaps of wild berries aroundas they are leaving sirens roar as we're under attack The attacker has a shivloves to fight and has eight skill ""We're finished"" I think as the attacker runs down towards the village but attacks the visitorthe visitor manages to put a solid slug into the attacker but is killed in the process The attacker is wounded but proceeds to move towards PatriceI order Patrice to stay behind the door ready with her club The attacker busts the door down and charges in but after suffering from blood loss Patrice is able to knock him out with a single swing from her clubtalk to people You see what normally happens is these attackers are hard as nails to recruit to your villagewith some taking days and even seasons before joining your communityPatrice didn't even need food to entice himas soon as she walked into the room he instantly switched sides and became Patrice's bitchPatrice settled into her new roles as town artist and socialitewhile minion one got to work erecting a wallfinishing some farmland and contructing a kitchen and dining room for Patrice to enjoyall in a day's work as it werenow she had a minion to dominate she finished everything with precision and haste She developed a taste in gardening as the minion went to work digging out the tunnelsconstructing two cells for conversation duties and completing a new throne room and Queen's chambers for Patricenormally I would look purely at the stats of a character to pick them for me but Patrice has changed my attitude herenow I look at the stories these colonists have as the main driving factor in selecting themlisting Rimworld for GOTYplayed a touchshe's still aliveHad a colonyGREAT colony Had Olga the spythe fucking bestonly one person I left behind could fight firesJess the cook The caravan lead by Olga finds the dudefixes him and they get dragged back after a extra day of getting split up before returning to the colonyat the main basea pack of MANHUNTING RABBITS decided to swarm the colony No big deal All the rabbits get funneled in and get slaughtered Acouple people get bit and have to be patched up So lots of people are sleeping off being covered in rabbit bites Suddenlythere's a heat wave Lots of rabbits lying in the open on the floorsand people spend all night stuffing rabbits into the freezer before they rot They go to sleep latewhatever There wasn't alot of meat leftbut not before the fire has already spread into the warehouse and then subsequently to the lower housing area- that happens to have wood floors and all wooden beds Jess is attempting to fight the fires alone for hoursbut not before it becomes too much and begins SUPERHEATING THE FUCKING COLONY to 1400 degrees in certain rooms He has to take breaks running in and out of the compound as he tries in vain to fight the fire Finally it's called to just let the colony burn Everyone evacutes the buildingit can be rebuilt But not before people get trapped inside Colonists braving the superheated building attempting to find fallen comrades pull them outside while receiving burns from the superheated aira billow of smoke is seen The returning colonists who don't fear the fire begin fighting it as best as they can The warehouse is lost at this pointbut losing the fridge would be a death sentence They lock up in the fridge and begin putting out fires as they come It isn't enough They get pulled out and collapse on the ground outsidethose not

as the bots began to stride quickly across the farm fieldsthere was a time for a brief conversation between the two Malakor laid his hand on his husky Senacacomforting her for the last time The conversation had a good final affect on morale as the two were swarmed and disappeared into a brilliant explosion of red mist and scrap metal Senaca somehow survived the intial explosion but it

Definitely worth it in my opinion And I've only played for 20 hours (and have gotten not too much donebecause there is so much to do)  It's the best base-building survival I've played yet You get attached enough to some of your colonists that you become sad if anything happens to themexcept you can't build multi-leveled buildings (Two-story)Lumine is staggeringly ugly and has an annoying voice So my colonists don't really like her much  My surgeon Toni has been through so much She has gotten her leg and arm ripped offso I've operated on her and given her a metal arm and leg She is literally Edward Elricexcept instead of fighting Scar she is healing Scarsand warm when it's cold You can do this in different ways such as crafting them the right clothingand having heaters/coolers Your colonists need to eat You can have them eat raw humans and animals like savagesor you can have them butcher animalsand cook different meals so that they can stay healthy You need to build a freezer so that your food won't deteriorate You need a medical room for the best effective chances of successful operations and treatment You'll need to build wind turbines and solar generators so you can give power to the things in your base that require it You need to build a research bench and research new wellbasically everything So the game doesn't just give you everything that's available You have to work for ityou start off with 3 colonists And you stick with them for a while an"
1,"[b][h1]EDIT:[/h1][/b] OverallBrawlhalla has changed drastically since the release of this review A lot of the information here is no longer correct and there are new gameplay featuresdash being the most important I certainly still feel that it is far too easy to avoid and/or delay interaction between yourself and the opponentbut it would be disingenuous of me to pretend the specifics of this review are still accurateI must say that it comes with a massive disclaimer If you just play Brawlhalla with your friends and never take it seriouslyyou will likely enjoy yourself Howeverif you ever get good at this game and play at a decently high levelBrawlhalla's glaring failures as a fighting game will become so unignorable that your desire to play it will steadily decline till you're on the subreddit crying about the passive float meta like everyone else All of the reviews - including the negative ones - are ignoring the real problems with this gameand it's something I have thought about for a long time SoI'll try to explain my reasoning as best as I can and briefly include the reasons why I still consider it worth downloading despite its enormous flawsBrawlhalla is an entertaining party gameprovided you have some friends to play it with Soif the only thing you're looking for is a simple game to kill some time (read: 1500 hours) withdownload it It is very easy to play and you are practically guaranteed to pick it up quickly regardless of your fighting game experience Aside from being easy to playit is also free to play and only cosmetic items cost moneyso it is easy to get into as well There are a good number of modes for you to play with your friends to prevent it from getting stale You can level up your characters and unlock new colors for each few levelsso there is some degree of progression and playing a lot of one character can feel slightly rewarding It also helps that a potato could likely run this gamethatâ€™s just about all the positivity I have to share As someone who has played and seen this game played at a very high level for many hoursI can confidently say that Brawlhalla is a fundamentally flawed mess I'm not going to complain about the toxic communityor the netcodeor matchmakingor any of the stuff you see other reviews complaining about I'm only going to talk about the game's core mechanics and why it fails competitivelyand if you are running you can dodge twice in succession When the iframes from the dodge endyou are able to jump or attack almost immediatelywhich is one of the main reasons why itâ€™s so ridiculously safe You can also jump in any direction 3 timesand once you're in the air you can quickly fall to the ground to get all your jumps back and continue hopping around This combination of instant invincibility on a 1 second cooldown and an insane amount of aerial freedom results in a passivefloaty meta where playing optimally means avoiding making any approaches Usuallymaking the first attack means risking being punishedwhereas dodging or floating away is safe and can potentially put you in a position to punish a whiffed attack Because of thisit often feels like youâ€™re chasing your opponent rather than fighting them Seriouslyplaying this game feels like you're in space with how effortlessly you can float around and avoid your opponent Constantly approaching will get you killed faster than a lone cripple in a collapsingburning building Sometimessalty players will run away from you in ranked just to troll you and you will have a very hard time catching them Yesthis is a problem with the communitybut it shouldnâ€™t be possible in the first place A key reason this happens is because dodging is a stupidly easy way to escape pressure Any time you get hit you can just dodge in one of eight directions and reset the match to the neutral phase Brawlhallaâ€™s neutral phase is reminiscent of two kids hopping around on a jungle gym endlessly until one kid falls and hurts themselves (in this casehurting yourself would be equivalent to approaching)but it's rather forgiving and you only need to touch the stage for a few frames before you can resume wall camping Once you get comfortable with movement in this gameitâ€™s incredibly easy to dance around on the wall for as long as you wantyou might be thinking that all the problems Iâ€™ve listed thus far could be addressed by nerfing dodge in some capacity Unfortunatelythe entirety of Brawlhalla has already been crafted and balanced around this awful mechanic Certain weapons are better at punishing dodges than otherswith some weapons capable of dealing massive damage on a precise dodge read A considerable dodge nerf would mean that these weapons would benefit immensely and quickly become meta The only way I can imagine this gameâ€™s passivity problem being fixed would be a colossal rework of dodgingjumpingand probably every weapon in the game as well Understandablythe developers donâ€™t know what that rework should be and how to conduct it Theyâ€™re trying to fix the gameâ€™s passive float meta by applying band aid fixes that ultimately do very little to address the hugeoverarching passivity problem Brawlhalla has always hadI told myself I was going to play ranked with the only intention being to winwhich meant playing fully passive and not caring what people thought of me I quickly reached top 50 in the world doing this Almost nobody gged me and plenty of people complained about my playstyle in post game chat Admittedlyalthough I am never toxic to anyone regardless of how they playI don't blame a single one of those people for their anger Brawlhallawhen played at a high levelis legitimately one of the most frustrating fighting games to play in existence Just imagine losing to someone after they avoided approaching youwall campedor outright ran away from you for the entire game Considering thisitâ€™s no wonder why Brawlhallaâ€™s community is a cesspool of toxicity and noxioussalty fumesI cannot justifiably do so Most people who play this game will stay at a basiccasual level and never even notice or be forced to encounter the serious passivity problem this game has Sodespite my frustration with BrawlhallaI am giving it a positive review My recommendation would be to play with your friends and avoid taking this game too seriously Howeverthe prevalence of the passive float meta is noticeable as early as high platinum/low diamondso be very forewarned and prepared to deal with it if you intend to play this game for many hours>man like smashIt's one of those games where you'll say""I hate this game""and then immediately hop into another matchThrowing the gun gives you more range than actually firing itIt's one of those games where you'll say""I hate this game""and then immediately hop into another matchnon-visible form of self harmIt's one of those games where you'll say""I hate this game""and then immediately hop into another matchMakes you angryi wanna punch myself every time i play this gameThe amount of time I've spent in this game would be surprising considering the score I'm giving itbut I cannot seriously recommend Brawlhalla when there are so many better ways to use your time There's NO community in any online game I've faced (not even other F2P games such as LoL) that is as toxic as this one is If you don't live close to one of the servers for this game your connection is jsut utter garbage You're always gona have some sort of input lag If you've ever played any fighting game you'll realize this game is very unbalanced and devs just cycle through metas to hype the tournaments up basically as they know exactly what they're doing and it's not balance There's no penalty for doing or not doing stuff here (NO Rock Paper Scissors type of design you find in literally EVERY OTHER FIGHTING GAME) The whole economy behind this game revolves around being an assholetaunts are the best selling in-app purchase by a mile If you don't live in the US (or one of the 1st world countries) then good luck trying to buy anything as the premium in-game currency price isn't region adjusted The more you play and the farther you get (up to Diamond) the more passive and boring the game becomes There's footsiesthere's defensive oriented characters in other fighting games but this is ridiculous some matches will be stalemates where your opponent will literally just run away As a matter of a factrunning away is objectively more effective than anythign else which is an incentive to play passively Why? Because you have more options to run awaydodgedefendthrow your weaponetc than you have to approach Why would I recommend a game whose population is mostly kids yet it has the most toxic players ever? Everyone is tired ofthe toxicityof the passiveness and the overall same-ness of the game You don't have to believe me if you don't want tofew people really talk about this but it is the truth You can check ""toxicity Brawlhalla"" on Youtubeyet it lacks any balance to it The fact they don't do anything about it yet they pour a new skin or toxic taunt every other month tells you what the developers' priorities are (its a business after all) Toxicity is a moneymaker Even Brawlhalla's top players complain about the things mentioned and even moreyet in years those complaints have not been adressed at all Boomie (#1-2 player depending on the year) has complained about a lot of stuff throughout the yearsSandstorm (undeniably #1) focuses on playing Smash competitively yet he absolutely DESTROYS this sceneeggsoup (ex-top 8 regular) constantly points out the problems with the community and the metadopameme (one of the guys who made the best exhibition combo videos) has complained and left the competitive scene due to several instances of lacking balance These are people that have thousands of hours poured in the game and they all agree with thisnot gonna liebut I do not recommend it when you have to face an absurd amount of toxicity if you're a casual and an insanely passive and unbalanced meta if you're playing competitivelyRules of Brawlhallabut still losedoesn't rank upderanksthis game is actual painranked is very fun if you hate yourselfI have played this game to deathand I love and I hate itthere isn't a game on steam I could recommend to you moreparticipating in tournaments and attending LAN events During this time the game has seen it's upsand its downs Ultimatelydue to its amateur but dedicated and communicative dev team ""BMG""it has come out on top!and the competitiveoh man The competitive community is freshyoung and enthusiastic It's everything someone looking to get into competitive gaming / self-improvement could wantbut has a well rounded set of fighting game dynamicsbut it plays very cleanly (with some of the best netcode I've EVER SEEN)as well as supporting a huge variety of characters and weaponsbut there is more room for you as an individual to make an impact It is NOT EVEN CLOSE to too late to get into the gamethe community that gathers at our offline events is one of the besthands down I've had some of my best experiences IN MY LIFE at these eventsthere is no reason not to at least TRY this game If you're a competitive person but haven't found the right game for youhop on the ranked ladder and if it doesn't get your blood boilingdoesn't do it for youwell it was free anyway!in case you didn't knowthe world championship is on November 3rdand has a $100000 prize pool :)Good game if you want to have mental breakdown and literal cancerI play this game just to get thrown  and juggled aroundfeeling the sheer helplessness and lossHeard about this game from a friend Tried it out 1000 hours laterI still LOVE it A++++Good game if you want to have mental breakdown and literal cancerI got a lot of positive emotions from the game only after I removed it from my pcDevs refuse to fix the broken metathey consistently buff characters that dont need buffingand nerf others that have been getting nerfs for 3 years now Some characters haven't had a buff since Beta and now because of the 34 odd characters and new weapon typesthere's a massive skew to 2-3 specific weapon types that they won't fix Devs don't read their own Steam discussion with countless threads from players complaining and noting specific things wrong with the game Very frequent lag and desync issues the devs always blame on your ISP or your router rather than their shitty servers456 times in a row despite there being thousands of people playing in any specific ranking bracketbut it's so fucking broken and full of bullshit toxic players that I can't play this game anymore without getting angry at itthis has been my TEDtalk"
1,There are no videos in this FIFA 22 page at the time I'm writing this reviewbecause those new technologies that EA advertised in YouTube videos [url=https://youtu.be/o1igaMv46SY] (Hypermotionetc) [/url] are ONLY AVAILABLE IN NEXT-GEN CONSOLESnot in PC. Basically if those videos were in this pageit would be false advertising and you could apply for a refund even after 100hs. That's why they need to make new vids different from the ones they have in YT.but also don't trust the blissful ignorance of those guys giving the game a thumbs up. We PC players are being charged the same money as console playersbut we're getting a watered down old-gen version of FIFA (FIFA 2019 with minor changeslike CR7 in Manchester Unitedetc). Just look at the the recommended specs and file size of FIFA 22they are the same specs as the last 3 FIFAs from past years (requires 50GB39GB after downloadi5 recommended & 8gb of ram). This is not the first time it happenssame thing happened last year with FIFA 21in PC they launched the game missing featuresso it might happen again in FIFA 23mark my words.they said & I quote: [url=https://www.pcgamer.com/ea-doesnt-want-to-exclude-some-of-fifa-22s-pc-players-so-its-excluding-all-of-them/] we don't want people with low-spec PCs missing the ability to play FIFA 22. [/url] They also said that they weren't interested in adding those missing features in a future patch.but if you still want more reasons:so you won't be able to invite your friends & play remotelyinstead each one of you will have to pay $60. (Game publishers in Steam have the ability to enable or disable this feature).so why'd you buy it now if you can just get it for $1 in 6 months? (monthly)this means it will take a lot of time to find online matches after some monthsso prepare for high ping depending on your region.thankfully they reverted it after A LOT OF backlash from their usersthey said it was an error from Steam.so the gameplay doesn't reward great crossespassesetc. Just shoot from a far distance & you'll score. If you're too close you won't.then FIFA 22 launches a sort of mini-launcher in which you'll have to click Play againotherwise the game won't start. Doesn't bother me but it makes me think: Why is it published in Steamif we'll end up using Origin? Does people just accept these things after throwing $60 for a copy-pasted game that will be purposely outdated after a year?FIFA 20and other games like Back 4 bloodetc for a whole month but also access to a 10 hour trial of FIFA 22 as soon as you bought itplus access to the full game in April 2022. But if you REALLY want to play FIFA 22 so badlyjust get EA Play PRO for a single month($15)it gives you UNLIMITED access to FIFA 22 for a whole month & also unlimited access to BATTLEFIELD 2042(plus early access). Just don't spend $60 in this game at allrather buy EA Play Pro for 1 month to try things out.The auto-loss after alt-tabbing to check Discord or skip to next song on Spotify might be the most ham-fistedfrustrating feature I've seen in an online game.1 minute silence for the people who bought for full priceEA is being disgusting by releasing the same game for the same price [b]lacking core features[/b] that consoles have and being completely shameless of doing so. If u compare the actual gameplay to the next gen u can see clear differences. even main menu looks basic and ugly on pc (compared to consoles). I didnt expect that they would ever do such a thing sadly so i wasted my money on this piece of shit but hopefully u wont. [b]Dont support EA[/b] and this copy-pasted gambling simulator we have been seeing since fifa 15.Okayso I am just going to use this as a platform to go off on a tangent regarding EA and not actually review the game (because it is the same damn game every year any ways) itself. EA: You are an utter disgrace of a company and I wish you nothing but the worst. The way you have treated FIFA fans on PC is beyond unforgivable. You treat us like second class consumers. Like we are not validyet you are more than happy to take our money every single year. And you KNOW you will get our money every year because no matter how much we hate youyou have monopoly on the football genre - PES died completely with eFootball - and at the end of the dayour love and passion for the beautiful game of football is what makes us buy your cr*p product every year. There is NO excuse for us PC gamers to not have next-gen technology. We have far superior hardware than any console - YOU GAVE NEXT-GEN TO GOOGLE STADIA!? - out there and we are more than capable of running the game just fine; your argument of: But we found that most FIFA players on PC do not have good enough PCs to run next-gen is completely void because the beauty of PC is that you have options! Give us the option to choose. If you have a good enough PCthere is no reason you should not be able to go into the settings and completely max out the graphics with next-gen technology. This argument - excuse rather - is nothing but a lazy cover up. AlsoI just want to add the fact that you charge as much as you do for this game and you can not even introduce Brentford's stadium to the game is nothing short of a disgrace and an embarrassment. You did the exact same thing last year with Leeds when they got promoted. Prior to thatyou would always add the stadium of the team that got promoted to the Premier League. Now you do not even do that. You make billions every single year exploiting football fans and our love for the sport. Have some shame.your launch on Steam has been atrocious just like last time. People are paying over 80 dollars or more in local currency for Ultimate Edition and they were not able to play the game until today. You are radio silentyou offer no helpyou offer no support and you simply do not care about us. Shame on youEA. Shame on you.It's actually insane that the PC version isn't like the next gen consoles. Pretty sure my PC is the equivalent of like 3 Series X/PS5. I just wanted to play the new story mode and see my boi David on the opening scene but like the HyperMotionIt's not on PC.ctrl c + ctrl vDO NOT BUY FIFA POINTSAnother money-grab by EA ultimate team game. Only playing it with my friends and nothing else. Pro clubs are also fun(with friends ofc).why does PC version gets the PS4 version? Does EA think PC graphics are worse than PS5? Who the hell knows...pros:I swear they deliberately make career mode trash so you play FUT. There are far too many times the ball goes where you do not want it to. I gave it more than 50 hours and I am done. 3/10you can sell peopleCareer Mode > FUTThis game is literally just a yearly subscription.Same game as last year with new rostersas I expected. Even has some of the same bugs that have been in the game for a couple of years. You are better off sticking with previous versions if you have them.they need to add Dragons. Also the kit you choose as the away one is used as a home kit.this is not a good way to solve that issue.wtf? I had a 90-97 potential player! Poof he's gone!speed is better in the gameseems like fast players actually matter again!Same Game better grassdont buy packs for the love of allahI love kicking ballsBuy FIFA 21 its the same game on PC cause EA decided not to give PC the next gen treatment. You'll be saying to yourself while you play why did it pass it to the wrong guy? What is my keeper doing? Where is my defense? cause the AI is so bad that the AI from FIFA 12 is better than this game. This will be the last FIFA i buy. EA doesn't care about quality they only want your money. And me being a person that doesn't spend a dime on micro-transactions i expect to lose a lot of game from people that spend thousands of dollars on FIFA points to get the best team possible.Wooo FIFA 22
1,-Start campaignI've been stuck at home due to cancerin constant pain 24 hours a day for the past 5 years I can honestly sayit only became bearable when Total War Warhammer came out Thanks to both this and the previous gameI've managed to put up with it
1,"Keep in mind that I have played Smite for 4 years nowthese Steam hours are merely 1/5 of my whole playtimeand while I don't regret any of those purchasesI really can't recommend this game in this state Smite is not the problemit's a good game Hi-Rez is the issuecash-grabs and rigged systemscancerous matchmakingunbalanced and clearly developer-favored charactersbugs aplentyone completely incapable and utterly useless CEO that holds back the whole department and one of the most toxic communities that even rivals Overwatch's communitySmite is your gameSmite was still in open beta and probably my favorite game for years It was diverseset itself apart from all other MOBAS through its 3rd person perspective and tons of different maps It also had that great concept where you could just buy a skin that you wanted But then Hi-Rez published it's first chests There were only 2 exclusive skinsbut they quickly realized how much money they could make off that garbage system In the following years95% of all new skins were exclusive or limited - put in cash-grab events or chests There was a time where there wasn't a single directly purchasable skin for 6 or more months To this day there are still gods with well over 5 skinsall of them exclusiveso about 320â‚¬ to 640â‚¬ respectively[b]per roll[/b] As a new playeryou have 0/55 items from the Curiosity Chest Each roll costs 320â‚¬ The chests are also riggednot joking herewhich means you'll get the skin at ~53/55which puts you at a staggering 170â‚¬ just to get that one skin you wantedthe grande finale of cash grabsthe so called ""odyssey"" Smite teases one ""Tier5 skin""a skin that changes basically everything a god has to offer in terms of design It's comparable to LoL's ultimate skinswhich cost about 20â‚¬ The only issue here isthat you can't directly buy the skin You [b]have to[/b] get a ton of other exclusive skins you probably don't even want for that one T5 skin that's barely worth 20 bucks You'll lose about 100â‚¬if not morein this great ""odyssey""as Hi-Rez likes to title it The odyssey is also often accompanied by several ""adventures"" Adventures are basically one sort of RPG where you choose one god and kill some monsters The catch isthis map doesn't changethe map always remains the sameand all rewards are either locked behind a paywall (who would have guessed) or a tedious grind-fest that'll probably take millions of your brain cells and about 2 weeks of your life I'm not even going to talk about the recent ""adventure""because that's just a pure jokebugs Smite suffers from so many bugsmany of which are present since closed beta Some of the more recent ones are so gamebreaking it's honestly a joke that they're not fixed yet First offIn 99% of all matcheslobby chat just doesn't work It won't even appear in your chat box You can't communicate with your teammates while you pick your godsalso in 99% of all matchesone or more gods won't load in your stats screen Which basically meansthatif you press TABit won't list that particular god You can't see their items (which in turn means you don't know how to build against them)you can't see their relicsnot even their score Their kills [b] aren't even listed for your team[/b] You basically have a ghostsometimes your game just freezes on defeat or win screen and just crashes alltogether Present since betathey're just addressing itafter 4 yearsI just want to point out Hi-Rez' favoritismregarding both gods and modes As you would expect with godsthere are just certain gods which are blatantly overpowered or just unfun to play against These can usually be identified by looking at their skinsbecause they usually have billions Examples would be LokiNeithHercules or Nox These are not necessarily overpoweredbut have heavily bloated kits which make them almost unkillable and totally unfun to play againstSmite has a multitude of gamemodesmany more than HotsLoL or DotA Nowthe issue isthe whole game is balanced around the ""main"" modeConquest; the typical 5v5 tower-and-minion-push modewhich every moba has In my 4 years of SmiteI have played 18 matches of Conquest To compareI've played over 2000 matches of Arena (5v5 without towers)600 in Joust (3v3)500 in Siege (4v4) and 900 matches of Clash (5v5 mix between Conquest and Arena) I never really found the ambition to learn all 4851 rules of Conquestso I stuck to the other gamemodes which barely required 2 of my 5 braincells Hi-Rez just tries to force Conquest down your throat at every single possible moment IIRCone of the design-leaders even talked about removing other modes so people would flock to Conquest This alone truly catches the sheer incompetence of Hi-Rez's executives Most players even stated they would quit before they'd even touch ConquestSmite's community I'm more of a casual and average playerbut every single match you're plagued by atleast one incredibly inept (most of the time they're low level because matchmaking sucks) or toxic playersometimes even both The problem isthat just like in many other gamesmost players think way too highly of themselves But Smite players take the cake They not only play godsthey [i]think they are gods[/i] The ultimate pinacle of garbage this game has to offer can be found on reddit You can't criticize one single god without some white knight showing up and defending their true love like there's no tomorrowbecause ""muh waifu"" It's one of the most toxic communites you'll ever see in any videogameso rev up these mute buttons Just be aware that you can't mute incompetence Alsothe matchmaking is so fucking bad that I have a legit 85% winrate this season Every game balances the winrate around 50%I'm fascinated that both Hi-Rez and Smite are still alive Hi-Rez ran so many good games into the groundgunned them down in the streets or left them to rot in their bug-infested basementit's a miracle that the company isn't bankrupt Play this game if you wantbut you'll be disappointed in the long runwhich is the worst kind of disappointment Many years I've defended both Hi-Rez and Smitebut at this stateit doesn't make any sense to I've had my funI don't regret a single penny or minute I've spentbut I'm about doneThe MOBA for people who don't like MOBAsFree to playwithout constantly being bugged with microtransactions Overall it is a solid gameand with the number of gods it takes quite a bit of time to really learn how their abilities can work together I would consider this game relatively easy to pick up and play but it will take you some time to really master the finer details Give it a shotits free and if you happen to hate it you can just delete iti play this everyday but i hate itFun MOBAuninstalled and run directly through hi-rez client which makes it work better No idea if it is steam's fault or my hardwarelots of game updates since thenoverall experience hasn't changed much although the community has definitely become slightly more than moderately toxicA game that is absolutely in the deathgrip of a bad decision driven company  This game is no longer about the love and passion that was felt years ago  The steady decisions to ignore or just flat out be incompetent at addressing the communities complaints are the only real constant hereto be honest Ohand a constant influx of new bugs while old ones remain and even evolve in annoyance(Athena's release)  As a referencethis is about midway through beta  I've got 2440H and 55Mso almost about 700 hours additional to the numbers shown here in Steam  It seems like every hour I play these days is just enjoyed less and less  During betaand early season 1 + 2there was a really heartfelt development aura that you could feel with every patch  The gods that came out were much more enjoyable than almost everything that's come out during the past year or so(I will admitI do love Cerberus)  But when you compare gods like ChernobogAchillesHachimanand Thoth to gods like TyrAh Muzen CabJanusand Scyllayou can just tell there really isn't much actualy originality being dumped into these kits  They may have one mechanic that is new and excitingbut other than thatits just a better version of a previous gods ability and a boring passive slapped onto it to make it feel like its actually fresh  (It isn't)they were all right  There was a chest with approx 55 items in itincluding voice packshigher tier skins  It was pretty cool  Also included was the new Nuclear Ymir skin and Derpules skin  Neither of these skins were really that out there as far as the original appearancebut they had nice little gimmicks  Derpules took the joke of the community hating new hercules model's tiny head and took it furthergiving him a pea sized head and a funny helium voice pack  Nuclear ymir was also just a bright green version of ymir with a fun and unique voice pack and some pretty impressive effects added on  These two skins were not exactly incrediblebut they were fun and acquirable if you had already invested into much of the (much smaller) cosmetic inventory  Nowevery single patch that comes outthere is a new chest (Sometimes even three)slapped full of random older skins and all kinds of miscelleaneous cosmetic bullshit that shouldn't be in the game either  I believe it was something along the lines of 8 months before an actual Direct purchase skin was released  Everything was a gamble  And that is bullshit  Many of the skins are now just unoriginal theme crapquitor fired  Nearly every member of this employee pool was a well knownwell liked asset of the community  Now the company is flooded with all of these people that don't seem to even really give a shit about engaging in the community  SNK8Four is my prime example  This man was absolutely adored by the communitythe pro sceneand pretty much anyone that began watching smite on twitch in its early days  He was very much the face for many people that began early  Then just one dayhe's gone  (To be fairHi-Rez no longer deserves him)  So these decisions are just weird from an outside perspective  The new character design lead is just full of shitthe new artwork / effect guy (HiRezChuck or some shit) is just a flat disppointment with everything(WE NEED MORE ANIME AND SKULLS GUYS) Its really just confusing to see this massive sweeping directional change that the game has hadespecially considering HiRez floundered their partnership with Tencent which included remodeling and removing pretty much everything in the game with skullsand now they are just fucking everywhere  Its edgy and annoyingand should rightfully be added  I guess I'm just too numb to it at this point to have thought it up while typing  The matchmaking in this gameis terrible  Absolutely terrible  The queues are diluted because there are so manywith 4v4 and an objective boss in the middle to facilitate pushing  Intended to be a somewhat shorter mini conquestminimal wave farming  Its pretty much just the chance to beat the snot out of each other  This is the game that is ranked as the most popularhowever its 5v5 still with far less focus on jungleas the lanes are closer together  Pretty much arena with a little bit more farming and a center objective bosssmall side jungles and an objective boss in the middle portion  Also a more popular game mode than Conquestso now you only sit for 3mins at a time for casual conquest  Matchmaking still seems pretty random skill wisein my opinion  I get the skins in chests thing  I get the god design thing  I get the business/employee thing  But when your game is about beating the crap out of each otheris it not an all around better idea to focus on improving that aspect?  New gods are horribly bloatedevery ability becoming a novel to read as opposed to the long forgotten ""This ability will hurt people in front of you"" mechanic  Old gods are left to rotunless Hirez has decided to do massive sweeping changes to an entire kitbuffing three separate things about them and then wondering why they are overtunedof which they will then follow with sweeping nerfs that do not address the new problems and simply deteriorate a god to uselessness once more  OP Gods sit at that stage for a much longer period of time than you would expect  Conveniently when the oddyssey skin for Ullr came out(Buy all the items throughout a time period = approx 140$USD)Ullr managed to sit at 100% P/B rate for Months  MONTHS  Tiny little nerfs came in to give the appearance of adjustmentbut it was incredibly shallow and obvious  3 months after the skin came out and was no longer acquirablehe was hit with multiple nerfsbringing him in line When a new god is releasedthere are two possible scenariosrequires no assistanceand will absolutely make everyone else have 0 funif the person playing them took the 10 mins it usually take to figure out the core mechanics of this god(Looking at you Chernobog)and I do not want to even KNOW how much money I have actually spent on it over the yearsincluding a +1500$ to the world championships in January of 2015  (EDIT - I forgot I also attended in 2016)it is also a huge regret and a downward slope  HiRez needs to get their shit togetherbecause this game could easily be so incrediblebut they refuse to take the proper stepsThis game is like my wife; I'm apparently never good enough despite my accomplishments I keep getting yelled at and insulted but I keep coming back I honestly don't know whyPlayed the game 1900+ hoursThen stopped playing because life stuff happened and tried to re-log after 2-3 years of not playing Smite and my account is banned for no reason I started playing when Scylla came out I believe and had to stop when Hachiman or Artio came outI even had odyssey Archon Thanatos and other T5 skins on my account only to find out that all that time and money invested on this game is gone foreveralso a lot of smurfs in early games and meta slaves everywhere in casual I would suggest that your don't spend money on this game like I did because one day your account might get banned for no reason and support won't help you at allSMITE is a fantastic game that takes the MOBA genre into a 3rd-person perspective; allowing me to implement the aimingtiming and skills I've gained from playing other gameslike shootersbut with a stronger emphasis on strategy and team building-- making the combat fast and highly addictiveit relies less on builds and the minions/creepsbut without removing those elements of strategy either Rather than losing an integral part of what makes other MOBAs enjoyable and meatyit replaces them with what gives games like first-person and third-person shooters depth It panders to and compliments a different stylegiving a different experience but in a familiar formatbut it feels right You're playing the role of a godand by the time you're at end-gameyou have bigger threats to worry about-- other gods It's satisfying to build a tank that 5 enemy gods and a towerall at oncecan't easily kill It feels great to have your team expect you to clutchbut succumb to the pressure and miss all your shots I love saving a teammate at the last possible moment by landing a perfectly aimed and timed kiss from Aphroditewhich stun locks the enemyweaving in and out of battleaim and speed Team fights are intense and replicate the rush you'd expect from a competitive shooterall while respecting the governing outline of a MOBA That makes SMITE a truly unique experienceplay LoL or Dota They see other games within the same genre as direct competition to the game they love They don't care about enjoying games for what they offer; they compare and contrast simply to feel like theyâ€™re part of a teamâ€”for the sake of ego Itâ€™s as though they themselves had a hand in the game development; they're veryvery proudit substitutes with a skill-orientedhigh speed combat experience It has depth and develops a skillset absent from other MOBAs So it comes down to misunderstanding the skills necessary in SMITEperhaps more I wish my friends would play with mebut most of them have 'standards' and strongly draw the line after LoL Theyâ€™re better than Smiteand If I want to play with themIâ€™m going to have to play their favorite MOBAbut even without a single friendthis game has kept my attention and I'll continue to play itSMITE is constantly evolving New skinsnew godsnew mapsredesignsnew itemsnerfsbuffsnew UIetc In the short amount of time I've played the gameI've seen many drastic changes If you tried Smite years agoitâ€™s a promise that this SMITE is a completely different game today-- by this time next yearit'll have drastically changed again All these changes are enhancements and true refinements to the game It continues to get better and betterand HiRez listens to the playersDota and Heroes of The Storm as wellSmite's unique camera angle alone is enough to set it apart from other MOBAsand developer Hi-Rez didn't stop there Each map is polishedevery God looks and sounds greatand exceptional Match of the Day modes offer plenty of variety Some late-game balance issues asideSmiteâ€™s divine execution of innovative ideas make it a worthy contenderI hate myselfThe MOBA for people who don't like MOBAsThe more gods that come out the more hentai you can find onlineRISE AND FALL OF SMITEbut nothing that really bothered me We had He-BroLil' ManaOlympian Anhurbut I felt like these skins we're not seen too often They did not break the immersionSeasons and Items New gods kept getting more and more overpowered to push people into buying the God Pack Bellona was a fine example It took them months to fix a godthat everyone agreed was beyond broken Simple hotfixreduce healing in half? Nope We saw her fighting 1vs2's1vs3's and shivered at the mere sight of it Console players had to suffer her for even longerQins/Fatalis meta where Cernunnos and many others were running rampant with insane damage and mobility(I still have 88% win rate with Cern and 86% with the Bee) Then there was the Defence metawhere assassins and warriors built 4 bridge itemsand were able to destroy mages and hunters with easewhile taking barely any damage Hi-rez did struggle massively to balance the gameand as they added more and more Gods and Itemsit was even tougher job to get things right We've all seen how bad it eventually gotwe saw where the manpower has gone Skins The base mechanics are barely workingwhile leaving people often with issues like:forcing you to restart the gamebut they did horrible job with managing the game There are few expectationsbut most of these skins are not appealing They are all copies of each other with the same Edgy RobotSchool GirlStuffed AnimalEdgy Demon and Edgy Demon Hunter Knight Thing kind of themes They have been using the same taunts and cringey pop-culture references for yearswith the same god damn voice actorslore and divinity is all gone The balancing is underwhelming These gods are complete jokesthrowing around Cringey lines and occasional VELVEL spams I used to read lore behind my favourite godsthat's how big of an impact the atmosphere had on meleaving Smite behind with no care for the well-being of the gameleaving people who spent money on that skin disappointedNuclear Ymir and 4 Convention skins in the last 6 chests It is all a scam for the people with gambling tendenciesit was still missing in July hours before writing this review This is not healthylobby and friendlist bugs are gone for me at least Great!August 2020 update:the game now crashes constantly for multiple players I've sent several emails to Hi-Rez since originally posting this reviewand haven't had a single response Every time the game crashesit bans you for what seems like a completely random amount of time For exampleI have been banned for 24 hours30 hours10 hours30 minutes10 minutesetc No response from the development team whatsoeverthe community is absolute trash Every single person is toxic and no one ever wants to help As of July 2020the game has been taken over by trollsthe developers are just as bad Several people in the community who have made smite as popular as it is constantly get abused by the dev team Even casual players can fall victim to this as wellall they have to do is mass report you and you get banned The

steam and 11k on ps4 this is what you need to know before buying the gameit takes time to learn about the gods every god has specific builds and mechanicstell them you are new to the game and they will understandits a smaller conquest against 3v3 but it has some mechanics as conquestI think it's about time I finally review this gamewhich was over 2 years ago I remember that I was a HUGE fan of the old Sun Wukong (Hun Batz nowadays) and enjoyed the gamealthough I never got hooked into it I eventually just stopped playing and went to get addicted to other gamesnamely Team Fortress 2 Fast foward to 2015where SMITE is finally released on Steam I was very curious to give this another tryso I did Nowbefore I continueI have something to say All of my good friends know this fact welland I HEAVILY emphasize this:but I just never liked thembesides Awesomenauts I downloaded SMITE and gave it a second chancefiguring it might be pretty cool now Okaythis is the part where you look at the number of hours I have in the game Just take a nicesolid look at it To the review!but at the same time it actually looks really nice in some placeslike Siege and Conquest Not much to say herebut this is not a game for the photographers out there like myself""Is SMITE a good enough MOBA to compare with LoL and DOTA?"" The answer to that question iswellyes! I find it much better to BE the character your playing asrather than telling them what to do It's what makes SMITE stand out from the rest of the crowdand it shines brightly in this way I don't want to start a flame warbut although it is very simple to understandthe game is much more difficult to master because of the fact you have to actually LAND your shots No more ""clicky-clicky here's the part where 3 champions die"" or whatever Your abilities matterand missing one could change the course of a game Plusof courseteamwork is important in Conquestand I haven't actually encountered many ""OP"" godsif any at all Some items are clearly better than others *cough* bluestone pendant *cough* *cough* but most aren't too severe OverallSMITE delivers with the gameplay by milesthere is no known story This will not be counted towards the final scorebut the some of the voice packs you can purchase for gods are actually really funny Some of the writing is extremely clever and gives the game a LOT of personalitythis game is much easier to pick up and playalthough still being a very competitive game The communityalthough not sunshine and rainbowsis much easier to deal with and far friendlier than those other toxic wastes of ""communities"" The gameplayas said earlieris simple and it doesn't require too much experience to understandhowever I would recommend staying away from Conquest in that case There are also daily rewardsbut I don't like the fact that the prizes don't get increasingly better after 7 daysbecause it doesn't feel right getting 75 Favor for playing 8 days of SMITE Invest the timehoweverand it'll greatly pay off Trust me on thatSMITE gives me a much better point of view on MOBAsmy least favorite genre of gaming I can easily recommend this game if you don't want to go through a brutal experience like DOTA and LoLand the fact that it brings out its differences with pride makes it one of the most enjoyable and addictive games I've played since Team Fortress 2truly hard to masterAmazing game"

1,"( Updates at bottom )I looked at the titlelooked at the screenshots and groaned ""Not another 'zombicide game' trying to say it's a 'survival game'"" But he got it for meand it woud be rude to not atleast give it another shot I'm rather glad I didset to the medium difficulty Day one was a messI figured I was playing another left4dead 'survival' game which was all about killing as many zombies as one humanly can before wandering to the next area Wellafter breaking a few weapons on zombies and getting no reward outside of what lint was in the zombie's pocketsI knew I was wrongand night had begun to set in My friend luckily -had- played before and warned me that things got a lot different at nightso we managed to make it through with no deathsbut many close callsI'm more than hooked Survival is the key- Foodwaterscavvingrepairs and building at day Sheltersecurity and stealth at night Crafting damn near anything in a Alpha gamefrom multiple layers of cobblestone walls outside of what used to be a log cabin Each peice taken the long crafting process of finding rockschopping them down into stone and then turning into cobblestone More? We built a second story for storing items More? Two layers of spiked pits surrounding our 'cabin' with only a bitch for us living people to cross More? Another storyturned into a rooftop farm of cornblueberries and potatoswe try to keep quiet throughout the nightslimiting player activity to things that dont make soundor carry foods on our person that generate smell ( Yesthat's a thing!)

Worth the moneygreat with friends- Especially when you notch up the difficulty and find yourself hiding for your life in a closet with nothing but a stick to protect yourself!and fun as is2014 Update: 1)but it has been brought to my attention that a good amount of people have read this So I thought I owe it an update due to the manymany changes to the game:though soso much more crisp now than it was before A lot of the bugs have been worked out (Some still linger) You now can upgrate tiles after you lay them into more fortified version of their previous selves (A wooden frame - Wooden block - Reinforced wooden block - Metal reinforced wooden block) As well as many other types of similar thingsit's rather neat I thinkthough has its bugs and the occasional cluster of buildings you recognise from the old worldbut still adds a great stuff Maps now have a ""fog of war"" making it harderand more exciting to go scavanging!Minecraft was too boring for me (I'm not a creator for creations sake)I enjoyed the additional combat focusI didn't like the lack of building (at least when I played it)but it got stale as there was no forced conflict No reason to exploreno reason to keep building So it fell into the minecraft trapbut gives me a good solid foundation of conflict and purpose to my building Not only thatbut it creatively forces/encourages me to get out of my safe keep and risk exploring which causes me to engage with the game content in a very enjoyable fashionand I've dedicated 90% of my gaming hours to this since I bought it over the holiday break Strongly recommend!I play with my son and 2 grandson'sit keeps this grandmother up late at night on the weekends Who says an Ol' lady doesn't have anything in common with the younger people I love it!im 65 and been playing games since the early 80si have around 1500 hrs gameplay in 7 days to die game and must say that this game is on the same fun level as half life when that wonderfull game first arrived everything in the world is destroyable and everything is useableeverything that lives in the world is killable and can kill you i will be playing this game till the day i die both single player and with my friends it is slow in moving forward to a full release game but the money has to come from somewhere and funpimps are not a huge companyimagine this game if funpimps were as big as bethesda or the other big game companies the fact that this game is so playable even in its unfinished state should tell you all you need to know keep hard at it funpimps its a yes from me and your through to the finalsOne of my favorite games that I have played in the past five years has got to be 7 Days to Diehands downmaybe even my absolute favoriteI dont play it for three or four hours before rating ityou're barely into a game to even rate itin my opinion At this momentI'm 529 hours inso I felt the time to review it was approaching fastso here I amI had been scrolling around on YouTubelooking for games to watch people playwhen I accidentaly stubled upon this gem I only saw Alpha 1 gameplay at the timewhich barely resembles what this game is now Despite how it lookedI had been looking for a survival base building game for a long timeso I bought it one weekendand it absorbed my soul and then someyou have little to nothing on you You have a bottle of watera bandageand some food to start with You can loot your surroundings to get some basic materials to start making a stone axe to start getting wood to make a simple shack If you don't want to build a base in the beginningyou can claim one of the many buildings and fortify it so it works as a home until you decide what you wantwith zombies added into the mix Depending on your difficultythe zombies might be a niusance or an absolute nightmare to deal with Every 7 daysa Zombie horde will come to attack you and destroy the precious progress you've made on your basehence the name 7 Days to Die In those 7 daysyou will build your baseand get traps and weapons ready to survive the night and emerge victorious from your base when the morning comesit senses how well you're doing If you're sweeping through the zombie hordes and haven't died in a whileIt will send stronger zombies in more numbers to try to give the hardcorre people a challengebut for the sake of people who get bored of reading reviews all daylet me get to my pros and consand start all over again on another world with different settings to give your veteran self a bigger challengeto keep the game fresh EDIT: Even though the updates come rarelythere is SO MUCH added each update it's sometimes like you're playing an entirely different gameso if you build a structure incorrectly or a zombie takes out an important support beamthe building could fall apart around youalong with your supplies being cast into the voidthere is a huge variety of serverssome being PvE(Player verses Enemy)others being PvP(Player verses Player)other servers being modded to give the game even more lifebut they happen at least 3 or 4 times a yearso you will be playing the same thing for at least a couple of months before anything new is addedwhich is annoying at timeswith so much to do and a horde on Day 7 being a problem that might overwhelm some players I would reccomend watching some people play this first before jumping inmainly so you have a vague idea on what you are doing After that initial curvethe game definitely gets easierthen this game might be a bit dissapointing for you The modelsespecially for the playersaren't too pretty to look at The zombies are a bit betterbut like I saidthe graphics are a bit dissapointing to look at The landscape is kind of blockybut It is a minecraft-like gameso it is to be expectedthis is one of my favorite games of all time It does have it's flawslike not super good graphicsa bit of a learning curvefew updatesand the occasional bugbut what it has far outclasses its conslike solid gameplaylots of repalyabilityand having building physics that make you build smart and realistic I would reccomend at least trying this game outI think that you will enjoy it!Three friends and I spawn in the wasteland biomestarted turning into something permanenthidinga trench around itis just a small story (that wasn't even in full detail) of what 7 Days to Die is like Very few may say that ""Ohit's just another zombie survival game"" or ""Ohit's just a DayZ knockoff"" WellI'm here to tell you that this is not the case at all I own H1Z1DayZand 7dtd I have to say that this is the best one Why?may take a bit to get used to Butstill awesomethere are actually physics to the building system Likein some casesyou actually have to put support Otherwise that sniper tower or that neat house will collapse on you Which has happened to my friends It's kind of satisfying to watchbut damn you're mad if it's your structureyou have: beesdogsand zombies; and other different kind of zombies to add to thatI'm good""because they actually threaten you The fact that they sprint at night by default (settings can be changed) also adds a thrill to the game To a point in which you don't even want to leave your shelter at night because you can hear a spider zombie calling a nearby horde Hordes also happen randomly at anytime and anywhere This is also unheard of in DayZ You never see a horde in that game Alsoas the days go onthe zombies start to get a little tougher You start to feel that the apocalypse is worsening Zombies are also smartdon't think that just putting a wall around your base will help Zombies will rip through it and actually dig under the wall We've seen this done in our server beforeand it's frustratingbut it's so awesome having to constantly keep maintanence on your base and look for new ways to prevent them and to see your weak spotsand you wanna know the awesome thing? This right hereis just an alpha A fucking Alphaand the developers have already come this far As I type thisthe alpha11 update is imminent and should be released any day now This is said to be the biggest update this game has seen This game is going nowhere but upI can't tell you about the PvPbecause my friends and I just normally play on a private PvE server and survive together I have no idea how well PvP works If I ever play PvPI'll tell you how it goesFirst time playing when it turned night I had no choice but to burry myself in the dirt$^#@ themMy first foray into 7 Days to Die went like this:then proceeded to accept a quest from her to gather supplies from a location about a kilometer and a half awaya broken arm and legand an infectionbut they still took some time to heal and the infection wasn't going anywhere I retreated to the trader but she had no antibiotics for sale which meant I was on my own for the infecitoncoming across an abandoned hospital Reasoning that I could likely find medical supplies yet to be plundered or spoiled inside I girded myself and broke infighting my way through several floors worth of the undeadduring a quick outdoor run through a small open air garden to get around a barricaded part of the hospital I discovered birds could be zombified as well and was promptly attacked by a flock of the rotten budgies I was able to fight them offbut this upgraded my infection to serious and gave me a fresh laceration Thankfully I had located bandagesI had no gun I left it lay and continued onwards to the rooftop Peering carefully over the edge I saw no less than a dozen zombies led by one that seemed much larger than the others By now my food supplies were exhaustedmy water supplies were running lowand I had no means to make a campfire to replenish either Deciding to declare ""bollocks to this"" I carefully made my way back down out of the hospitalwould get mauled to death by a zombified Yogi Bear again7 Yearsthe fact that it has sold so many and is so highly rated yet is still considered Early Access Alpha is beyond me Updates are still churning in The 193 B6 update? Available to opt in as of yesterdayit's time to poo or get off the pot You're making a mockery of what a game in Early Access means As buggy as it isCyberpunk 2077 released fully before you did We're up to the Playstation 5 Your game is good but you can't keep the training wheels on forever It's never going to be perfect Nothing isI was playing modded minecraft many moons agobut it was just too safe You build your house and bamyou've always got a safe space Pahnever total safety I wanted the chance of losing it all I also wanted zombiesyou can still make yourself pretty safe You can mix concrete and build a shimmering tower bristling with spikes and traps You can look out your windows and laugh at the slightly glitchy feral hordes as they stream screaming to your door beneath the blood red sky You can go about your crafty business as they claw at your walls You can feel safe But not forever There's always a timer ticking in your mindthey'll get in[b][u]UPDATE:[/u][/b]I felt as though I needed to update this review to reflect on some of my experiences over the past couple of years I have picked the game up again on occasionbut didn't find myself as content to continue playing as I used to be There have been many changes over the past couple of years; mostly in terms of your character having a skill and perk systemwhich is a nice addition and adds a lot of RPG-feel elements Howeverthe game suffers from something I feel a lot of survival games lack; 'end game' replayabilityas written in my original review below (long before I had so many hours played)but the fundamental problem is that once you are establishedonce you have access to creating your own munitions and have the hardware to farm resources effortlesslythe game becomes quite stale I'm sure the addition of more NPC's etc in the future will amend thishaving a reason to leave your stronghold and go out into the worldbut I feel as though the developers are perhaps setting their sights a little [i]too[/i] high*sigh*) was met with a huge backlash of negativitymostly because the game needs so much work - not in terms of contentthe game has an endless amount of items and block types and there is still the potential for a massively popular RPG/Survival experience in this game The problem is that some of the core engine mechanics reallyreally need work Movement feels sketchyaiming weapons and firing them feels far from smooth and the game doesn't exactly run smoothly at high settings even with beefy hardware This was forgivable 2 years agobut for it to still be playing this way is dissapointingand I'm sure I will return to itbut I would love to see the developers iron out the creases in the core game mechanics instead of having such an enormous amount of focus on adding new things Finding poop in toilets and having the ability to throw that poop is hilariousturning that poop into compost to grow crops more efficiently shows great ingenuitybut I only wish they would iron out the creases before adding to the already vast amount of items/blocks/locations etcit is a great experienceespecially with friendsbut for it to become a true blockbusterI feel the developers need to take a step back and improve on what is [i]already there[/i]digging a hole in the side of a hill before nightfall and hiding insidestarving and hoping nothing would find meseeing sunrise has never been such a relief After some exploration and scavenging for food and waterI found a townthinking this would be a good place to lay my bed and fortify a building to try and hold off anything that came for me at nighta horde came for me and trashed my defensesthe few crossbow bolts I had managed to craft were consumed in no timeand I found myself in a backroom hacking through the roof trying to find an escape routemy friend below me yelling at me to hurry up as he desperately tried to repair the door that was being pounded on by zombies ""I see daylightI've found a way out!"" Our glimmer of hope ruined when I looked down to see my friendlooking up at mewith the floor beneath him almost completely destroyed and a horde of zombies under himbarely a block left to stand on I told him not to look downbut naturally he didwhat ensued was a genuinely fearful collaboration of curse wordsdesperation wouldn't be a fitting enough word to describe itthis game has brung about a whole new meaning to the survival genrebeing in a fortified position and crafting yourself a lot of ammunition simply won't cut ityou can play rambo for a short time but your resources will eventually diminish if you use them too recklessly and you will find yourself back to being starving and hiding away once againyou really need to think about how and when you're going to engage the zombies by choicebecause when a feral horde comes for youyou won't have a choiceand you better be ready for when that happensit is also a brilliant game to play with your friends and rewards co-operative gameplay Sustaining yourselfby yourselfis indeed possiblebut with friends you can assign eachother certain tasksfor example me and a buddy built a fortified bunker with a deep mineshaft underneathhe spent most of his days underground miningcreating ammunition and suchproviding me with raw materialswhile I worked on our surface defences and food supplies Do-able alone but so much more efficient if planned with a friendor a few friends is even betterunless you are the hardcore lone-wolf typeI can imagine that adds whole new elements of fear-factor into the gameknowing that other survivors may just snipe you from a distance and steal your stuffat their own discretionor maybe they will help youit's up to themI may build the courage to try this somedayat the moment I'm happy enough just trying to survive waves of zombie hordes on a PVE serverthere is the occasional annoying glitch/bug here and there as to be expected in a game at Alpha stage but I have found nothing game-breaking as of yet To think that there is so much more to be added in terms of character customisationexperience pointsmore weaponry etc is a very exciting thought indeed I can see this game making a huge impact on releaseit is genuinely brilliant funespecially playing with friends!the title is misleading it only took me 9 minutes to dieFirst spawnkilled by pigkilled by same pigfound blunderbuss and murdered pigOkay How to review this game As you can seeI have a lot of time into this game I'm so very torn on how to review this game because my opinion of it is bittersweetto put it bluntlythe goodto dateeverything in the game has a useand the progression is decent900 hours invested in this gameover it's lifetimeit's a good game with lots of replay value This game has the most value of any game I've ever ownedand honestlythat in and of itself is hugefor the badbecause as of lateI've been very very disenchanted with the developmentand methods for developing the game (Mind yousome of these gripes can be adjusted with settings) but franklyfrom where the game startedall the way to where it's gone over the past couple of yearsthey are very much validand quite honestly worth addressing hereis that no matter what you dono matter how much you progressyou cannot ever be considered ""Safe"" Any time the community finds a way to make a base type""Safe"" the developers change the entire AI so that these methods no longer work The issue with this isat the end of the daythere is no point at all in progressingas the zombies rip through just about anything that you'd buildin a matter of minutesand the defenses are easily dispatched and insanely underwhelming Back in the dayI used to work my butt off to get to concrete and steelso I could make a defensible base It gave me a reason to play and something to work towards And because of this gripeI can no longer play this game without getting bored after a week or soand quitting for months This is what killed the game for meoverallyou used to be able to skill up by preforming the tasks that you wanted to level This was amazingand was very much like ""real life"" This was one of the things that drew me to the game in the first place How do you get better at something? Practice! Now basicallyyou kill zombiesgain XP and spend points from level-ups Franklyit makes no senseand this change was explained away in the most stupid way possibleand it made me lose a LOT of respect for the development of this game In factthis is when/why I stopped playing the game as much as I used toand was the start of my distaste for it Apparently ""leveling by doing"" isn't ""realistic"" and in order to conform to the desires of what I call the ""Immersion Turd"" communitythey've effectively done away with one of the main things that made the game unique and overall enjoyable/rewarding to playwith the introduction of vehiclesit cuts the size of the map downimmensely Finding borders and endless oceans as a border is a complete Buzz-killas the game itself isn't rewarding to a nomadic playerwhich this game eventually forces you to bethe longer you play Simply putthe mapseven random-genis cappedand smalleven at the maximum map sizebut when you need to increase the XP gain to 300% in order to pace the game at a normal speed There's a problemand barely worth putting herebut it is something to note TFP have seriously lofty goals with their updates This is finebut at the same timeit's not Because of thisupdates can take 6 months at minimumto release Most take nearly a year Which is fine I guessas most of their major updates change the game greatly The fact of the matter isthe development has been ongoing for far too longit's far too slowand franklythis is one of the many many things that are destroying the game's long-term successthis one speaks for itself by this point There is NOTHING in the way of endgame There's no reason to even get thereand by the time you're at a point where you can hold your ownyou're so beaten down and burned out from the issues listed abovethat it only leaves a bad taste in your mouth This has been the issue with this game since day oneI would completely recommend the game Obviously I got my money's worth The game is fine I will still say that this is probably the best survival game to date It's worth buying But if the devs don't stop intentionally screwing over their communityand ignoring the need for endgame contentthey're going to destroy one of the best games of the decade I'm on the fence on whether I would recommend this game to a friendI really am But to the average playerthe game is fine For those who started playing this in the beginning? It's a shadow of what it once wasand it's painfully obvious that the potential that it had was(putting it mildly) squandered It's for this reason why I cannot effectively say whether or not I'd recommend it Try it out for yourselfit's worth that much alone ;)I originally played 7DtD for barely 3 hours when I first purchased this game because I didn't see the hype and that was a HUGE mistake seeing as I only made it to Day 2 (I'll give details on that in a bit) and in that time I died twice (I collapsed my base and then did the same with my mining tunnels) I got annoyed as I thought the game was broken and buggyI then looked at the designthe fact that gravity affects structuresthe fact that you can get coldor overheat if you work for too longthe fact that if you get an illness and don't treat it you'll lose wellnessit's got a sense of realism that I've only honestly ever seen this game provideyou begin by building a basegetting some farms going for foodfinding lakes for wateryou go and raid some towns that you found whilst exploring to find the perfect spot for your baseand start making better toolsthis is the first part where you need to be careful: There's a heatmapif you make a forge or a mixer to get your base stronger you'll start to generate heat based on usage and that Can draw zombiesyou need to work out if you REALLY need the forge running 24/7or your Campfire running to cook those extra eggs Then you look to the top of your screen and realize It's day 6 23:48panic sets inyou know that in less than 18 hours you're going to have some unwanted friends because: Each day you hit that's a multiple of 7 (7/14/21/28/35/So-on) the horde attacksyou can't just hide in your base and crouch whilst praying they cant see youyou're hunted constantlyyou need to plan ahead and build a bunkeror get ammo together to defend yourself activelyyour base defenses hold them off for a time but they begin to shatterthe spikes you laid down begin to collapse under the sheer weight of the rottenmalodorous corpses baring down on themyour walls begin to crack as they're relentlessly pounded on by the undead hordes that seek to make you their next mealthen a friendly jingle playsit's 6AM on Day 8a smile crosses your face as you realize you survivedyou realize that once you've slaughtered this wave of undead fiends you're mostly safe for another weekyour bow thunks a final arrow into the Burned Survivor and he drops to the ground Relief washes over you as you set to work repairing and strengthening your basemy review barely scratches the surfacePLEASEgenuinely give this game a goI promise you'll never regret itthe devs have also taken a lot of the heart out of the game by making it too Pointless Over the top skill treesunending lagweird glitches and bugs that seem to have reappeared from earlier stages of developmentunnecessary additions to the game that are further damaging performance and gameplay Oh and the greatest thing I've seen so far? I made a post on the forums asking about the progress towards a Performance updateor a game cleanup updateinstead of receiving any responsesI got Banned TFP What has happened to you?It's one of my favorite games of all timeyet I cannot recommend it And it pains meI think that the latest updatealpha 17was a huge step in the wrong direction Instead of being a zombie-survival game with awesome building mechanics where you could build huge and massive basesit simply became a zombie-killing grindfestwhere bases donâ€™t matterbecause zombies chew through concrete like it was nothingdon't get me started on the zombie AI It was fine in alpha 16 and the zombies acted as you would expect; dumb In alpha 17the pathing of the AI is just ridiculouswhere the zombies are able to estimate the path of least resistanceas if they were not only sapientbut extremely intelligent This has led to the current base building-meta; mazes and ramps /facepalmyou could improve cardio by runningyou could improve mining-efficiency bywell mining - so on so forth Nowyou just kill zombies to gain expget perk points and then spend said perk points To be fairthey have buffed exp gains from other activities recentlybut you still simply gain and spend perk points - yet another horrible downgradeletâ€™s talk about loot In Alpha 16 you could loot items ranging from quality 1 to 600 Weapons and certain tools had components of individual quality that you could then combine to form said weapon/toolthat would have the average quality level of said parts The quality would determine the damage/durability of the weapon etc This system was great and gave an incitement to go out in the world and continue to looteven if you hadsay the AK47because you could improve it vastly by finding better parts This has been replaced by a system where all weapons/tools are looted whole in a quality system ranging from 1 to 6 Yes1 to 6 Minimal difference in damage/durabilitybut heyat least you can attach mods to the weapons now The amount of mods you can attach are determined by the level of the item You can now improve the damage of your rifle by painting it in another color Greatâ€¦and yet againit used to be just fine in Alpha 16 Donâ€™t bother mentioning it to the devstheyâ€™ll just give you a douchy response about your rig being a potatoeven though youâ€™re running with high-end partsno I would not recommend the game Howeveryou can opt in for playing Alpha 16which I would recommend â€“ if you can accept that the game might never evolve any furtherLong time player here Purchased nearly a dozen copies of the game for numerous friends and family A year or two ago I would have had great things to say about this game and the direction Nowhoweverthe story changesalpha 17 They changed nearly every aspect of the game That's okaythings change The majority of the playerbase overwhelmingly complained on the forums That's okaycustomers complainMadmolehonestly admits that he doesn't play the gamebut changes things he doesn't like about it He admits in videos how much he's forgotten about the game even though he allegedly is the primary programmer He then proceeds to have his forum moderators censor dissent and complaints hardcore and tells them that he doesn't care about their opinionschange is fine But saying ""I don't like aspect xand even though I don't play the gameand eighty five percent of the comments on the forum approve of aspect xI don't like itor didn't when I played a year agoso I'm taking it out"" is not okay at allâ£[h1]Exciting mix of DayZ and Minecraft[/h1]but regularly updatesIt took me several frustrating hours to get the hang of this b*tch but that was 2015 and now it accounts for less than 1% of my total play time  The rest is sheer joyand maybe a little bit of ravenous addictionbut at a base price of $25 as of this review I still consider it a steal  Catch it on sale and you're getting a deal so good it can only be called unholylol) and do your own math  I have probably spent a bit over $100 all toldthoughbecause I keep gifting the game to friendsand I still feel I got my money's worth easily  While there's some roughness around the edgeseven now (it IS still *technically* an alphathough that is easy to forget) the amount of content this game offers is absolutely staggering  Beyond thatas of Alpha 193 at leastthey've reached a place where it's very balancedrelatively newcomer-friendlyand well-pacedbut also in no small part due to the nature of the game7D2D retains a glorious ability to surprise meeven after thousands of hours of play  You just never know when you might get trapped in a barn loft one night with a ravening wandering horde around that notices the campfire you made to char up that little bit of meat you got from the lone pig downstairs because you're starvingand to boil a little water because you were in danger of dehydrating  Suddenly there's a cacophony everywhere and you clutch your pathetic sharp-rock-on-a-stick and hunker downknowing you can't fight themnot at this point  But you put the fire out and hold very very stilland they'll eventually go awayright?recommend this even to people who don't like zombies/crafting/survival  But most of all I recommend it to people who do like those things but have been left cold by other entries in that bloated genre  7 Days is the one you've been looking for[b]A16 Review[/b]000 hours?

1,"I am in my seventies  My son wanted me to play an open game instead of the single games I was playing before  I am inspired by the graphics of each country that I travel ineach one is different  The puzzles are complex but doable  Each cave is distinctive and some are so enclosed while others you have to walk through slimy water to get to the other side of the trail  It seems so realistic at times  The story line continues when you least expect it and you meet characters where you least expect them  Great Game  Glad I found and play itI'm a 70 yr old ladyand I've played for some time now and I love this game I will never be hardcore or even a good player But there are so many things to do in this game it is almost overwhelming Quests are very goodthe story-line is very good and last but not leastthe graphics are fabulousespecially on a retirement pay (shoe-string budget) I recommend a much cheaper monthly fee There is ofc the DLC content you get with the Plus membership but the ideal is to have a cheaper option only for that magical bag space just for crafters Wellit's just a thoughtI need that magic bag since I farm and horde like a squirrel and craft like a boss I have soon maxed out my main crafterthey know I am old and slow and they are patient with me HopefullyI will be a better team player this year I am working on itI questexplorecollect whateverdo delvespublic dungeonsworld bossesfarm and craft And I enjoy it all!the starting-date was wrongI got the game on 6 Dec 2017and started to play on my B-day7 Dec 2017 Otherwisecounting the hours of gameplayI must have been glued to the screenLOL I do have a life outside TamrielI promiseI have been paying this game for yearsbuilding my opinions of the game The easiest way to describe it would be Pros vs Conshard to masterit is diverse and fun enough to keep you entertainedthen become extremely profitable in the futureyou NEED to subscribe to ESO Plus (but as a little sneaky proESO Plus gives all the DLC bundled with it plus ""crowns"" equaling the price paid for subscription""though really funhas a very steep learning curve that leaves many unsure where to startluckily PvP isn't the main focus of the gameyeah Despite a rough launch in 2014ESO has improved and worked out MOST of it's flaws and kinksmaking it the great and enjoyable sandbox MMO it is todayand may you meet many fine people along your journeyAn amazing game  incredible variety of different activitiesmeet great people Highly recommend ESO for more seniors to play  at 70 i find it keeps my mind activehowever it gets addictiveTLTR: ESO is the best MMO I've played so farby miles For PvE combat is greattho I haven't played for long enough to get into PvP yet You can choose to grind up to cap in a single sessionif that strikes your fancy Or you could care less about leveling and still participate fully in all non-endgame PvEI can get to anywhere I've already been in between 30 sec to a minute For me this is a very important point I detest games that fakes longviety my wasting my timeand it doesen't unnaturally inconvenience the player to make me pay extra The only inconvenience in the game comes with spontaniously harvesting crafting ingrediants while questing at the same time This was an inconvenience in the Bethesdas Elder Scrolls games aswell because of inventory You can pay to unnaturally compensate for this inconvenience through an ingredient-bagor I can ignore the story entirely if I just want to grind my way to the endgame content or just want to explore This also means the game is extremely accessible for anyoneif I want to pursue it as a career There are few games where I enjoy craftingbut in this one it seems okalthough not innovative by any meansplayers are considered allies for the purpose of abilitiesand game mechanics generally supports doing so It works very well for any open area I've been toand is faster than grouping uppeople looking for a challenge will have to do a bit of searching or research where to go and who to hook up withESO doesen't have the mother-haul aspect of treasure-hunting that some older Elder Scrolls titles had For instancein the original Morrowind I could sneak into an ancient abandoned fortressfind a coven of vampires there so powerful they could one-hit kill mesneak past themdiscover an endgame weaponsteal it and leave It was a very unique feeling when just stumbling into it while exploringand frankly zero incentive to do so anyway in any area I've been so far Furthergetting a guild seems to be a matter of blindly accepting guild-invites from ppl spamming general chat For instance I've found no credible channel on how to get info on guilds that may be suitable for meseek them out and ask for an invite As a noob I find getting involved in the community in ESO a frustrating choreyou just have to find it yourself Also the queing I've done takes 30-90 minutes Some times of the day I'm unable to find PUGs for dungeons at all through this tooljust not very friendly either It may of course be because the Morrowind expansion was just released and all the established players are over therefor all I knowlevitate or do Khajiit-level jumps in ESOwhere there is a scheming badguy and everything except the end-fight is about thwarting his minions ""His"" minions are everywhere in ESO: Tamrieland it's just to much of the same This is very different from the other Elder Scrolls titleswhere the monsters of the land seemed to make up a whole ecosystem on their ownwith their own lives and events It makes the stories that follow the quests boring after 25 hoursand deteriorating rapidly at 50 hoursthey were the reason I never played WoW for more than 20 minutes In ESO they aren't as bad as the ones I experienced in the other title It's normally 3-5 targets instead of 20-30 At first it seemed that this type of quests would be fewbut it proved to be very frequent A real pityonly back then the format required some abstractions In ESO it's not an abstraction anymorebut a literally really dumb story-element While there are some straight-forward story elements of the type ""some soldiers have been capturedgo rescue them""nonsense solutions are more common Fully expect an NPC to suggest solving a problem by shooting her magic rainbow-ray at the moon while farting some magic sunshine But first you must go find her some rare shrooms at one locationkill 4 zombies at another locationget 3 seashellsthen kill an evil monster turtle-boss Then she can find the spy who's been taken prisoner by the enemy and learn what he knows And on to the next onewhere the NPC tells me this was all my doing I'm a hero It's not that it's wrongit's just that after a while all quest-givers start to seem like a benevolent school-teacher praising a 7-year oldnot being able to play Some are able to get it working through forum adviceand others can't and refund the game as a result The ugly part is that the developers don't communicate with the players and doesen't even acknowledge the problem It's been 3 years nowso it seems they just don't find the bugs worth the cost of resolving vs the number of resulting refunds and bad reviewsbut unless the story starts diversifying in the next area I fear I'll seek other content Maybe that content can keep my attentionmaybe not Regardlessthis is the best MMO I've played despite its shortcomings The combat is quite goodand the absence of time-sinks count for alot That saidI've yet to find an MMO that could hold my attention for more than a couple of monthsThis is a review from a new player aimed at new playersafter years spent on Dark SoulsDragon's DogmaRocket League and others  Me and my buddies are looking for a game to play together like in the good old days We're all dads with families now and there's no way we can get back to grinding like we used to (no pun intended)and everyone assures me that it very much is Might be worth a shot so me and my buddies decide to give it a tryand won't ever be The logistics of a MMO don't really allow the atmospheric beauty and complexity of a game like Skyrim It is however way deeper in lore and atmosphere than any MMO I ever playedand you can tell great care is taken into making the world of Tamriel feel alive and breathing as much as can be Every NPCs are voiced and side quests are literally everywhere Many of them feel generic after a whilebut some are actually really clever and well written The world is absolutely humongous and very variedwith there again great care paid to respecting the Elder Scrolls lore Long time ES players will appreciate the numerous references to stories and characters they already know wellothers surprise you with high levels of details Riding from city to city through woods and moorsacross deserts and sea shoresyou always feel immersed in the world as should be They also keep improving as the latest chapterSummersetis more beautiful and detailed than ever beforeas opposed to simply leveling and spamming skills like it's sometimes the case in similar games Me and my buddies have progressed steadily and we find ourselves beating dungeons we never thought we could beat beforeand not just because we leveled up but because we learned to work better as a team It's a very satisfactory feeling that the game encouragesand designed my character so I can switch from DPS to Tank or Healer or a mix of both when I play with my friends without much of a hassle I'll never be as performing as someone who would 100% specialize in either of these rolesbut I would say that for once hybrid builds are absolutely do-able in this gamewhich is very rarely true in MMOsyou will adjust to monsters on the world map and normal delves to a beatable level It does remove true challenge from these areasbut also allows you to roam the world freely to explore as you wishwhich is a worthy trade in my opinion as it allows new players to be free to discover this enormous world like they were on an actual adventure There are also no limits for partying with friendsso you don't need to worry about overleveling when you play on your own While it could take from the satisfying experience of leveling up in early levelsthe very flexible skill system feels like enough of a reward to keep it interestingDungeons and Trials aren't scaledand that's where the challenge begins Each dungeon has several levels of difficulty and we have been steadily progressing through them in our 2 months of playing Boss battles require strategy and analyzing the mechanics and can be quite epic Sometimes you just don't have the required level or gearsbut sometimes you just have to keep trying to get better We have beaten many bosses we thought we would never beat on our first couple triesyou start getting Champion Pointsto a maximum of 750 They allow you to keep enhancing your character slowly and end up making quite a difference in the long run As you get strongeryou'll be able to complete more difficult dungeonswhich grant better gears This is really clever designas the game never feels like a grind in the traditional MMO sensebut instead more of renewed challenges So far it has kept it's freshness to usas it's what's been preventing me from playing MMOs for so long In my 2 months of playing I never felt myself even having the desire of grinding for levels or gears I had fun doing quests on my own and playing with my friendsand my character naturally improved by doing so We are still a longlong way from reaching end game contentand are in no hurry From my experiencethis is quite a feat to accomplish this feeling in a genre that is most often grindy by definitionI would say that the game can sometimes feel a little blandbut then again it's a MMO and SkyrimDark SoulsWitcher III and the likes have spoiled us in recent years Quests can feel generic and repetitive but you also don't need to do 80% of themand then again it isn't a necessity as you can resell materials instead of holding on to them and ask players to craft for youthe game we were looking for at the right time for us I highly recommend it if you are also looking for a similar chillfriendly experience in the Elder Scrolls universeall gearedvet dungeons) kinda lost motivation to play atm tho but it has a lot to do with my friends not being around as much[h1]â”œ

This means a Level 10 can still be (relatively) effective fighting higher levelsso it's pretty balanced The PvP itself takes place in the Imperial Province of Cyrodiilwhich has been invaded by three seperate factions-Wood ElfKhajit)OrcRedguard)NordDunmer)6 of which surround the Imperial City There are also various outposts Around the castles are resourceswhichif capturedgive benefits to the faction who owns themand what convinced me to stay for 100+ hoursnot too obtrusive Levelling up is also pretty simple - each time you level upyou get to choose which stat to invest in - staminahealth or magickaYou can then choose a skill which you can plonk in your hotbar and use Nothing broken or overpoweredthough it does take testing to find the most effective skill setsI've not experimented in crafting at allso this section is from friends' experiencesthe materials are varied and it does take up time It's not simple Which is goodwith dozens of spells and effects going on as well as 100+ players on screen performing their own actionsit did not drop below 50fps Well optimizedlarge scale PvP is the only time I've ever dropped below 60fpsagainbut not particularly revolutionary or exciting Standard group quests and dungeonpretty simple Not a huge variety right nowI think there are about 7/8 without the Orsinium/Imperial City DLC I've had loads of fun playing dungeons with friendsbut it does become a bit stagnant once you've repeated them several timesand while the PvE isn't particularly impressiveit still functions Bugs have almost all been ironed out Worth your money if you enjoy the Elder Scrolls universeand are willing to accept certain sacrifices made by Zenimax to make the game a better MMOfeel free to comment constructive criticism/positive feedback-SoI hated this game at firstand I went into it with a mindset of ""FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO"" - In short don't do that This isn't going to be like playing SkyrimOblivionMorrowindit's set in Tamrielit sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game However being an MMOit has a lot of grindy MMO style quests And don't get me wrongit's bewildering at firstall these mechanicsall these places to goand before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong factionyou were screwedin a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you But thankfully they changed all of that The game scales nowso you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mateand still have some fun slicing up enemiesand spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 GigIf you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download)I got back on it after not playing for 14 monthsbut this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250So I was in luckhe introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing upshowed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my ownwithout any of my friends So I leftand keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like thatthis is the first one I'm enjoying myselfI'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now We've made a guild for noobies To help them outand get them to enjoy the game also Because the community is nicebut you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14 But you won't get that when you're in a guildhaving people to play with and explain all the mechanics did helpa lot I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so onwell done I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the endon EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the wayadd me or visit our [url=wwwgodsofsaltcom]website[/url] and join us on teamspeakor just message us in game @diseasedcrowjust doI'm glad I gave it a second chanceI'm pushing 1500 hours and decided it was time for a review Here you goit's a cashgrabbingPVPingmainstream-appealing mess'  Which to be fairwas kind of accurate back around initial release (from what I've heard) Jump forward give years thoughand it's come a looooooooong wayand the game adds its own bits and pieces - some new stuffsome expanding on previous knowledge  And there's plenty of books lying around for the lore enthusiasts to pore over You could quite easily play the game and completely ignore the lore aspectif that''s your thingbut you'd be missing out on a huge part of the charm of the ES worldboth the main questlines (of which there are many) and also standalone side quests Keeping in line with previous titles in the seriesthere's been an effort made to minimise 'Go and kill X bandits' or 'Fetch me X golden watercress seeds' type quests While ultimately all quests will be basically 'Go theredo thiscome back' they are well presentedrelevant to the storyline and generally cohesivebut that's part and parcel of the MMO genre Occasionally you will meet a new character who obviously thinks they know you - as far as I can tell this is an overhand from early days when different areas of the world were levelledand progress was more linear Modern ESO has level-scaling across the boardmeaning you can access previously 'end-game' zones from the get go It's not gamebreakingand very minor - took me ages to even realise it was happeningheavy attack or block I wassomewhat irked Combat is basically a combination of buffing yourself/debuffing enemies with 'abilities' and then using normal attacks interspersed with other 'abilities' All these abilities are accompanied by much pomp and circumstance - flamessparklessound effects and such I was kind of miffed that I couldn't just hit things with a sword/arrow/morningstar and occasionally swig a health potion Once againit's an MMO - not a single player adventure game Took a while to get used tobut you adjust There's also wiggle room if you want to be more of a puristbut you'll be cutting yourself off from most of the group/endgame activities by doing soSorceror is the 'Mage' and TemplarsDragonknights and Wardens are a bit of a mixed bag There's less of a Warrior/Mage/Thief theme and more of a Damage/Healer/Tank vibe to the whole affairdue to the traditional 4 man party setup for group activities Too much reading online will convince you that to be any good at all you need to shoehorn yourself into the current 'meta' build for whatever role you want to fill Reading these guides and builds is a great way to understand how to use skills more effectively or learn how different armour sets can help in combatbut at the end of the day they're best ignored Play the character you want to play - if you were good enough to benefit from squeezing an extra 16% DPS out of your toon you wouldn't need to read a guide to find out how to do itwith 'passives' that are vaguely in line with with the old 'Altmer have extra magicka''Khajiit be sneaky' stuff Nothing to prevent you from making an Orc healer or an Altmer brawler if you wishthoughalways feel free to ask questions in zone chat if you need a hand with something Lot's of helpful sorts out there PUGs can be a bit toxic sometimesbut it's easy to just leave the group if you can't be bothered dealing with someone excessively unpleasant Hundreds of guilds to joineverything from trading to roleplaying to hardcore score pushers On that noteif you're trying to do an endgame trial and suckthe other people are NOT being toxic There's an expectation that you will contribute effectivelyand if you're notwell tough potatoesarmor and weapon style diagramsfoodstuffsraw resources and other shiny bits and bobs Level up your crafting skills and you can make your own gearmake furniturepotions/poisons to use or sell You can also just go out foraging for stuff and sell your spoils through a guild for a tidy profit Nice low-key way to spend an hour or two if you don't feel like combat or questing and just want to romp around outside enjoying the landscapethere's a 'Crown Store' where you can buy stuff with your IRL fundage I don't think many people use it Lot's of flashy stuff (and lots of cosmetics) that after a few weeks of playing you can mostly find or make yourself in-game Subscribing to ESO Plus gets you an unlimited inventory for crafting resources (very handy) and access to all the DLC content (which can also be purchased one-off if you prefer) It also gives you 1500 crowns per monthso you can fritter it away on the more useful/appealing items if you so wish The game is fully playable without subscribingit's really just a QOL improvement and means you don't have to pay upfront for the many DLC zonesboth geographically and in terms of content New areas are being released regularly and despite the whining on forumsthe dev team does a good job of addressing issues and making the game enjoyableaccessible and true to the lore of the Elder Scrolls universe  You can play this as an MMOa single-player game or anything in between You can RP your way through the overland regionsor min-max your way onto some very competitive leaderboards  For meit's a great continuation of he Elder Scrolls series and also a very enjoyable (and affordable) MMO without that horrible WoW feel to it You're not forced into any particular playstyle based on your class or raceand there's enough content to keep anyone busy for many thousands of hoursor MMOsor RPGs in generalI suggest you give it a try It's a bit of a mixed bagbut such a large bag that you'll never get boredI've thought a lot about whether to give this game a bad review or not I almost didbut it would be unfair to the game The largest and most painful issue I have with this game is the in-game shop and the way that this game has been monetized It is so terribly monetizedthat I almost gave this game a negative review ZOS claim to only sell cosmetics and convenienceshowever both of these things clash with the core gameplay of ESOand with extremely expensive costs too The game is objectively worse off by the existence of these things I can count on one hand the number of mounts you can collect in gamebut the number of mounts you can buy or obtain through ZOS's loot boxes is closer to 100 This gives players less things to actually play forless things to collect and fewer targets to set for themselvesyou can buy time-savers which grant you ability points (if you've collected them on other characters)experience scrollsmount training and the research scrolls for professions The issue I take with the existence of these items is indicative of the fact that ZOS are aware that these grinds are a slug They are literally time-gated; you can learn one mount training skill every 24 hoursof which there are 180 skills to spend That is half a year of spending points to max out your mount training This grind must be done on each character The research scrolls speed up the rate at which you research a trait in a weapon When researching a traityou must wait an increasing amount of actual time before unlocking it and researching another My main character has gotten to the point that she must wait 20+ days to learn a new trait in some professions Or I can throw my wallet at ZOS and get it done instantly ZOSI want to play your gamebut you're making it so hard000 crowns (â‚¬85) and are unobtainable otherwise On the other hand the housing system in the game is phenomenal It suffers a lot though when considering how expensive furnishings actually areespecially when compared to how little gold you actually get for just playing the game While players can obtain some furniture pieces through playing the gamethese are extremely few and far between when considering just how many furniture pieces there actually are in the game The nicer furniture pieces are often priced at 10000 goldup to 100000 for the fanciest pieces When you only get 300 gold for completing a questas a playeryou must look to get money through other systems if you want to engage fully with housing and furnishing ZOSPLEASE increase the amount of gold you get from quests This leads me to the auction house in gameand ESO plusis by engaging in the auction house I love the auction house system in the gameand the way it forces players to be a part of a guild(s) One thing to help you make gold is the use of the extra bank storage and (literally infinite) crafting bag you get when subscribing to ESO plus If you plan to sell any crafting materials and you don't have the crafting bagbe prepared to have a full inventory every 10 minutes It's like ZOS are aware that not playing with the crafting bag is a handicapand so they move it to a pay-wall There are other ways to make money in the gamesuch as farming for rare item drops for hours on endhoping that one will eventually drop which you can sell for a lottery cash outand I never feel satisfied playing this game I want to engage in the housingbut the rate at which I can actually buy furnitureif I just do quests is extraordinarily slow The crowns I get with the ESO plus subscription make it a bit betteras they allow me to buy furniture and housing with crowns instead of goldbut I can't help but feel like this doesn't have to be a problem at allfix your monetization I paid for this gamelet me play it without locking features behind time-gates and pay-walls If you want this game to be subscription basedmake it subscription basedput everything from the store into the gameand remove the store You can't have it both ways I want to love this gamebut with the way this game is monetizedI can'tyou will probably enjoy the game if you don't engage with any of the things above But you might get frustrated at always having a full backpack and having to walk past all of the mining and herb nodes because you don't have the space to pick them up And then not having any money because you can't trade the materials you don't haveEDIT 2021: No longer recommendthey sold all their players personal information i'll never support them again Evermost people come into it expecting Skyrim online DO NOT DO THIS!as this needs to be noted!i can go into pretty much every building i come across Other mmo's don't do this Other mmo's don't have things scattered across their dungeons to loot aside from corpses Someone else might say ""well i can't pick up everything like i can in Skyrim"" No you can'tbut what mmo let's you? In this you can at least interact with objects more than other gamesyou have to block and dodge You can't get away with auto attacking! They have improved the feel of combatyou don't feel like you are slicing thin air anymoreeager to group upeager to role play and get into character No one is arguing in the chat! No one is spamming to sell you goldcollecting the reagents you need isn't a chore because the world is fun to explore and gather in! There are plenty of recipes to find and experiment withit's not mind blowing greatbut it does look goodespecially for an MMO This isn't going to look like a graphic mod for Skyrim so forget that! But it's no slouch either The lighting is very well done but some textures can be blanddozens of skills to choose from which only get added on from joining things like the fighters and mages guild or becoming a werewolf or vampire! You can use any weapon and any armor typethere are thousands of builds for each class! The best customization i have ever seen and i've been a rabid MMO gamer since 2003pet and costume They don't pester you for money with pop ups or anything annoying like that You buy the game and you choose to purchase aesthetics on your own termsi am enjoying my time in the game as a slow burn and i recommend you do the same! DO NOT be in a rush to get to cap! Live in the worldenjoy your ascent!i'm sure it's going to be very popular when it launches on consoles and the PC community seems to be growing now that the game is B2P!I lost my life to this gameand soon it'll be easier to grind out equipment with the curated drops system so you won't have to spend almost 167 hours trying to get the equipment like I didAfter reading all the negative comments about paywallssubscriptionsand overpriced items; I was hesitant to buy this gameand have logged on every day for the past 2 monthsand so many questsmy quest log is constantly filled to max capacityand I haven't felt the need to get a subscriptionfor which I need to pay real moneysave up gems and get what you wantperhaps there are better options out therelike methis is by far the best value I have ever got from any gameTheir last privacy agreement update (January 1st2021) states they will ""sell"" users informationincluding nameemail and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising) There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those termsvery sad practices for a paid game really[h1] Gamble's ESO REVIEW [/h1]after years of playing other different types of games i decided i needed my MMORPG fix again I was not sure what to expect but i knew i was a fan of The Elder Scrolls Universeplaying most the previous games in the series and being a big fan of the lore so i decided to give the online version a chancei was thinking ""do i really want to pay more money after just buying the game"" After asking a few of my friends who had played the game before i did more digging and found out i"
1,"I'm an older womanand I find that this game appeals to all ages  I have sooo many hours into this game and I love it  I admit I need my sons help and his friends to get me through things sometimes when it's a monster that's kicking my butt  I'm now at the stage where I can do it on my own  I think they did an amazing job with this game  It doesn't matter how old you arethis is so fun  I highly recommend this game  Thanks for doing such a great job with this gameI waited until I had at least 1000 hours on PC to write this review Honestly there's so much to say about this game Been a fan of the series ever since Triand I sank 800 hours into MHGU (which you can now buy on switchwhich is dope)slapping on a few monster partsthen calling it a day rather than creating a new design that creatively incorporates the actual design of the monster it's made from HOWEVERlots of the newest endgame weapons that were introduced in the Iceborne expansion are more creative and look fantastic With the addition of layered weaponsthis is less of a problem since you can make a bland weapon look like an endgame weapon or at least have it match your outfitthere are 68 large monsters to fight vs 93 large monsters in MHGU Howeverin MHWabout 5 of these monsters are either tied to limited events or are not really noteworthy (zorah is pretty boring imo) So that leaves around 63 monsters 5 more monsters are tied to the late game where you have to rank up enough to grind and unlock them So that leaves you with around 58 monsters for at least the first 300 hours of the game MHGU gives you 93 monsters that unlock as you naturally progress through the gamewith 18 of those monsters being deviant versions that can progress alongside your hunter rank so that they scale into late game with proper rewards once you get there Additionallythe monster diversity in MHGU is a lot higher There's giant frogsbig mammothsmore monkeysgiant crabsgiant snakesgiant spidersetc Keep in minda lot of the monsters in MHW are ALSO in MHGUwhereas the opposite is not true Iceborne helped to alleviate the diversity in MHWbut not nearly to the degree of it solving the problemso grinding is a huge part of the game This point is mainly for people who've never played the series MH is a grind To get better weapons and armoryou have to farm the monster enough times until it finally drops the parts that you need Then you need to grind it again for the armor And if you want other armors or weaponsyou have to grind those too With the addition of Iceborneif you want to unlock the true endgame contentyou need to grind your rank and farm the correct monsters to unlock the other monsters Then you need to make sure you have enough supplies so that you can craft enough ammo/potions/etc Grindgrindgrind If you are not a fan of repetitionthis is NOT the game for you If you're a veteran of the seriesthis point should basically be meaningless Why do you think I have 1000+ hours and I'm still playing?G rank hunts were more dangerous compared to Master rank hunts in Iceborne There are a lot of factors regarding the difficulty which people tend to either overlook or disregard In the old gamesmonster animations were a lot less telegraphed Some attacks would happen with very little warning visuallyand sometimes you had to guess which move would come out Healing was different because you ate a potionthen stood around and flexed for 5 seconds with nothing to do except wait for the animation to finish Skill trees were harder to customize because you had to hit a certain threshold of skill points before the skill would even activate Not to mention armor parts had less slots for your decorations Monster attacks did much more damage because there were less upgrades available to your armor Combine all of these together and you get hunts that were more dangerous because visual cues were less forgivingyou took more damagehad less skills availableand healing made you a sitting duckmonster animations are much more telegraphedwhich is much more fair imo It makes more sense that you can see a monster wind up to perform a strong move instead of the monster standing still for 3 framesthen unleashing a move that could kill you This means there's less BS moments when it comes to taking damage If you got hitchances are you saw it coming but might've been preoccupied with something else Healing is different because you can now drink a potion while moving instead of standing around and waiting for the animation to finish Againthis is another QOL improvement that makes more sense and leaves less room for BS or blaming the crappy controls Skills are more easily available because even if you only have a single point in a skillyou can at least gain a minor benefit of that skill Armor parts have more slots for decorationsso skills are even more accessible Finallyarmor parts have more upgrade levels This is more just putting 2 and 2 together If you have more upgrades to your armoryou take less damagebut really they've just fixed a lot of the annoying issues in the old games and given the player more tools at their disposal If you really want to emulate the difficulty of the older gamesdon't upgrade your armor so highdon't use the ""meta"" setsuse less decorations so that you have less skillsand stand in 1 spot while you drink your potions The beauty of this game is that you're not forced to always use the best gear or all of the tools at your disposal You can choose to make things more difficult for yourself if you want to But if you use all the best gear and you complain that the game is too easythen that's a personal issuethen you have a wealth of positive things to look forward to!craftingmovesetsloading timesetc If you're a fan of the seriesI think you'll love the changes Now that a lot of the old crap mechanics are goneeverything feels so much smoother and streamlined Farming supplies is so much easierweapon trees and stats are way more clearitem boxes are all over the base instead of a single locationetctheir weaknesseshow to prep for the fightetc And when it all comes togetherthere's something so satisfying about all your hard work paying off Of course you could just go braindead and wack them until they diebut to each their ownthis game is a grind You grind for armorweaponssuppliesupgradesequipmentdecorationsetc Grinding is part of the core gameplayso once you finish the storythere's still plenty more to work towardsmovesets were expanded Everything just got betterand with more monsters to boot A must have imothis game is more than worth the purchase And at the end of the dayyou're fighting beastsdinosaursand fucking dragons What more could you want?[h1]Most enjoyable grind ever[/h1]it is what the name tells you â€“ a monster hunter game You hunt monstersgather resourcescraft new gear to hunt stronger monsters to get better gear Thatâ€™s itvery simple formulabut gameplay is really amazingunlock better gear and stronger monsters and when you finish the story the real grind begins The grind is in no way bad in this game Yes sometimes when youâ€™re short on some common items going to hunt some weak monster could feel like a waste of timebut most of the time youâ€™ll be hunting strong monstersyou need to read their moves and prepare for their attacks You canâ€™t just run to the monster and mash the attack button to kill it This tactic would only work on monsters bellow your level First you need to choose the right gear with right stats for each monster You need to avoid strong attacks and find a window to hit the monster and use healing items You can also use other items like traps to capture the monsterbut first you need to weaken it You can cut-off and break various parts of monsterslike cutting off the tail for example After you finish the monster you can collect its parts and use them on crafting weapons and armor Oh and one more thing â€“ you can use environment to your advantagelike shooting a huge rock which falls on a monster Or another monster could wonder into the same place and attack the monster youâ€™re fightingbut some of them feel very similar to each other They look similar and their moves are very similar I wish we had more completely different monsters I know dragons are fun and cool looking but itâ€™s a gamedevelopers could think of a way to add different monster while not completely breaking the lore Wouldnâ€™t it be nice to have a bear-like monster which could give you a deathly bear-hug?Final Fantasy (which lets you turn your Palico into Mog) or Witcher Thereâ€™s even a Witcher quest-line and a monster from Witcher universe to fightso you can fire up the SOS flare and wait until someone comes to help you Or you can jump into someoneâ€™s session whoâ€™s doing the quest you need and help him thus completing the quest for both of youI guess itâ€™s running on an old enginebut overall graphics are good looking Performance on the other hand could be better Itâ€™s not badbut if you want to have 60fps on max settings youâ€™ll need a powerful PC The world is well crafted and locations look amazing Maps are huge and there are lots of things to discovermany of them feel too similar to each otherThis game is absolutely fantastic and is a blast with friendsthe upgradingand customizing of equipment and armors Alsoyou take away from the challenge of hunting monsters by giving yourself this (Base) endgame set right at the get gothen come back and try a different weapon and absolutely love the game (me included)talk to the Housekeeper palicoand access training You can change between all 14 different weapon sets in the training area)I'm in my mid 40's so I don't always have a lot of time to play games but Monster Hunter: World has me hooked Since I only can devote about an hour or so every night I just set a goal of what I want to do such as killing or trapping Anjanath to gather parts for the armor set It's slow going for mebut I don't mind taking my time because the fights are fantastic and sometimes last 20 minutes or more of pure adrenaline-pulsing bliss where a well-timed Palico heal or quick dodge or a perfectly aimed hit makes you feel like you are actually fighting a real monster and that your own life is really on the lineit's drop-dead gorgeous and runs at a nice buttery-smooth 60fps (on my RTX 2060 and Ryzen 5 2600x with 16GB RAM)and overall it's just insanely funIf you ever get bored of the end-game grindhere's a small list of things to do that may make you feel a little happytry to learn them all You'll definitely find something that fits you bestbut knowing another weapon makes you want to do hunts again and again You will get a lot more hours doing thisor with randoms While in most gamesplaying with randoms can hinder your gaming experiencebut that's with all multiplayer games There are bad applesbut in a coop gamethey're not nearly as problematic When playing with peopleyou can and will have moments that will highten your experience Like in Level 6 Kulve Tarothjumping down and breaking her gold coating on the horns with just one hit while your teammates drop rocks on her tailwhile also ruining her precious golden mantle You can seriously get a good sense of comradery when playing with people As for friendsdo the same thingbut also take on hunts that challenge you If you find a monster annoyingkeep fighting him Learn his quirks This game is as much a learning game as it is a fun game Learn weaponslearn monstersbut explore and capture small creatures you find This game has fantastic monster behaviours In the Rotten ValeI suddenly found myself next to an Odogaronand I prepared to fight him after he roaredbut soon he continued walking away Following him from a distanceI then found him going about his daily routinewhich was scavenging for food to bring back to his den Every monster has their own quirks out of combat They're not soulless creatureswhich makes

As of todayseems that issue was fixed at least on the PS4 I had no idea why it happens on PCbut the port job is not perfect You will face with random disconnections all the timeso get used to it until they fix the problemspecially when approaching to the chest when arriving into a questyour hunter will crouch instead of opening the chest It's a minor detailbut it bothers me sometimesbut updates fixed my problem in AMD RadeonI would suggest to use a controller instead if you're in that position I currently use a DualShock 4 paired with my PC via Bluetooth and works great The only issue is that the game doesn't recognize it as a PS4 controller and will show you an Xbox One button layout insteadsince it's an Xbox One portI tried a wired Xbox 360 controller to play the game and works perfectlymusic is greatgameplay is satisfyingit has a LOT of replayabilityeven after finishing the main storyI would definiltely recommend Monster Hunter WorldI would recommend to wait a bit before buying Monster Hunter WorldI would recommend to visit the discussions section to get more info about the game and see if you're convinced into buying itpersonallyI recommend this game for its gameplay and replayabilitybut maybe NOT in the current state with random disconnectionsit definitely can be betterAs a part of buying a new Nvidia GTX 1060I received a game for free named Monster Hunter World A gamewhich I had no clue what it was all aboutmainly due to my lack of knowledge of the previous Monster Hunter installments from Capcom I didnt even try to play the gameuntil one month latera land mass filled with monsters Along with the Research Commission that studies the land and its monstersfrom a region named ""Astera"" The player begins the game by commencing a quest in ""Ancient Forest""along with the characterI had also commenced my ""journey"" - a journey to the amazing world of Monster Hunter What an amazing journey it has been How do I even begin to explain?consists of many distinct regions like - Ancient ForestWildspire WasteCoral HighlandsRotten ValeElder's RecessHoarfrost Reach and Guiding Lands Each and every regionalong with its tundrathe materialsthe flora and faunathe wildlife are distinctly different from one another The joy I had in discovering the regionseven the smallest of themwere nothing short of amazing The amount of time spent on collecting materials from these regions is insanesince there is always something you would have missedthe player starts with the most basic of armor/weapons and eventually progress by defeating stronger monstersthereby getting better weapons/gear The real beauty of the game is that it allows so many different ways to achieve thiswith the help of 14 types of weapons Weaponswhich i have never heardseen or used before in any games Each and every weapon is uniquehas its pros and cons and not to mention their unique moves I started the base game with dual bladesswitched to bow till i reached a certain level and then changed to my favourite weapon charged blade My current go to weapon being Long sword I can keep on writing about the weaponsbut it is something a player has to experiencepersist and then slowly try to master it Players will have a total different experience in taking on the same monsters with different weaponsthe materials needs might be different and skills attached to it as wellhow to build the gear around itthe preparation - in identifying the monsters weaknessthe ""food"" the player needs to eat from canteen before a battlehow to use the environments in players favourhow/when to use traps Lastdefintely not the least and certainly the most important - studying/understanding monster movementsthere by developing positional awareness in battles This is crucial and is the main difference between a good hunt and tedious one where the player rage quits The concept is simplebut learning curve is steep and the player needs to persist with itin-order to have the best game experience Monsters can still wreck you even after this :)weaknessmovements and attacks are so different - that it shows the amount of work Capcom has put into them I have lost count on the amount of monsters and their ""variants"" available in this game This is nothing short of exceptional Monsters are so diverse and so much in much in number that I can write an entire section dedicated only about the monsters in the gamesince mostly i prefer only the single player side of things  The in game experience quadriples when you go to an hunt with a full team of 4 - something i enjoy very much to this day and always brings a smile to my face I have been extremely lucky in becoming friends with exceptional group of players and to this day we hunt as team And that list just keeps on growingbut still needs immense GPU power to play it smoothly The online server disconnectsglitches like playes landing on impossible areas and not to mention the insane grindin-order to get jewelsweapons and armorthe game is still extremely addictive I have played close to 2650 hours - managed to learn and use (frequently) 7 diffrerent types of weapons and still play with my friends as much as possible There are so many things I have missed to address This is mainly due to the immense depth of MHWthe amount of layers the game hasthat I find it next to impossible to explain each and every aspect of it Not to mention the ""events"" which keeps on pulling players to the game as frequently as possible - hats of Capcomyou have created an absolute beastplaying it almost every other day The journey which commenced with me stepping into a world completely newstill continues and I am pretty much sure is gonna last for a long time Quoting one of my friends - its that time of the day - time to bully the monsters[h1]First Monster Hunter[/h1]but I'm also gonna explain what it isand why itâ€™s so damn funthere are 5 big open worlds/maps These maps have huge monsters that you have to track downkilland harvest their glorious innards You yourself do not level up Youâ€™ll pick from 1 of 14 weapons (which is like your classand you can switch em out as well if you wanna try others) and craft better weapons and armor from the parts you farm from monsters You have a central hub (Astera) youâ€™ll probably spend a lot of your time inrunning side missionswhile also progressing through the story and unlocking new mapsmonstersand adding/upgrading beneficial NPC hubs  within Astera Thereâ€™s so much content in this game itâ€™s ridiculousconfusing and pretty damn difficult Youâ€™ll prob have to google some sh*t and some of the fightsespecially your first time going incan last up to 30 minutes Youâ€™ll have to learn the fightslearn the environmentslearn your weaponand learn what items youâ€™ll need to bring You craft almost everything in the gamefrom the coatings on your arrowsfoodtrapsto different potions for different situations Everything is harvestable from the world; plantsnutsanimalsbugsfishingetcallowing you to take on stronger monsters as you become more powerfulitâ€™s worse for people who try and run match making exclusively Me and my friends alonewe have connection issues but itâ€™s not nearly as bad as others are reporting I'm not saying the problem doesnâ€™t existbut for us its not unplayable   Honestly it has varied day-to-day Some days are worse than others When it does happenit literally take 5-10 seconds to reconnect Sh*t can be frustrating at timesespecially mid fightbut itâ€™s not something that's constantly happening to uswhen youâ€™re out on a huntyou can send up an â€œSOSâ€ If you or someone else needs a part from a certain monsterthey can respond to this sos and now you have a party of 4 going after the same target This is the only way I play MP when not playing with friendsand againI havenâ€™t had a terrible experience with it It has issues like the rest of the gameâ€™s connection issues but nothing as broken as Ive read in various forums I have never tried to connect to match making so I cant comment on that outside what others are saying There are currently 2 patches Capcom have been testing that are showing up in steamdb I should also note that I usually dont play until after 7pm estmaybe Iâ€™m just lucky There are reportedly fixes but I havenâ€™t had to do anything 980ti/i5 4670k/latest Nvidia driver and Iâ€™m running 50-60 fps mid-high settings @2560x1440 I do get dips in the 40s but againnothing game breakingnot for me at leastgoals to set on what you wanna do nexthelping each other out and so on The above issues are from my personal experience and in no way am I saying those problems donâ€™t exist Itâ€™s a f*cking fantastic game thatâ€™s unfortunately getting review bombed due to Capcomâ€™s slow (or almost lacking I should say) responsethe same day I posted this reviewCapcom patched the game The patch was intended to reduce connection issues for folks while they continued to iron it out Ive had about 30 hrs play time sinceand have honestly had 0 connection issuesplaying as I domentioned in the review Playing with friends in our own lobbiesor running SOS missions I have had 0 disconnects0 MW errors Every single MP mission Ive started with friends or ran in SOSs since the patch has ended without a single connection drop Some people are still reporting issues with match making or joining random lobbies I cant comment on these issues since I dont ever join themIgnore the connection issues negative reviewsDont let the mixed overall reviews scare youthe game is very enjoyable in its current state With the connection issues gone and several bugs fixedit can only go upwards from here Alsonew content is added every few weeks together with eventssliding downhill to launch an aerial attack and so on)sonic bombsetcbut can also be used to travel around the environment faster (hooking onto a wingdrake for example)which can turn the hunt to your favoryou shouldnt have any problems figuring them out even if this is your first MHwith plenty of gadgets to help you outthis is the only downside reallyfor both newcomers and fans of the MH franchisei could find a perfect jobbought a nice carand also find the right girl but instead i spend 300+ hours on this game"

1,"I am over 70 and I play because of the strategyhand and eyechallenges and the ease of the gameLet's face it: you're not reading reviews for Age of Empires II because you've never heard of it before; you want to know how the Definitive Edition adds or takes away from experiencing one of the most popular RTS games of all time. Coming from someone who has played Age of Empires II regularly since its release in 1999 (I own the diskssupported the HD versionand now this)I'm so happy with this. My review will focus on updates and changesgood and badfor players already well-versed with the older versions of the game.this game looks gorgeous [i]without sacrificing the original aesthetic.[/i] This is important. I'm not a huge graphics gal; if it looks prettygreat! But how does it PLAY? I worried that all the updates would turn one of my favorite games of all time into one that barely resembled what I knowand that isn't the case. Though everything is updated--from the tiniest fishing boat to each tree and forage bush--it all resembles its original aesthetic. Snow glistens. Fish swim in schools beneath crystal clear waves. Clicking on the ground to approve the construction of a building puts its blueprint outline down in a satisfying burst of dust.but some choices were made thatwhile unnecessaryare only appealing. For examplewhile foraging a bushit loses its robustness over time before becoming sparse just before it depletes. The same happens with ore mines. And oh my GOODNESS--destroying buildings is so supremely satisfying. Rather than just gain flames before instantly turning into rubblethe building collapses in spectacular fashioneach brick and shattered piece of glass tumbling to the ground under a cloud of dust. Different architecture leads to matching piles of rubble. To say I'm impressed by this is an extreme understatement.and I found myself so frustrated with the updated AI. It ruined the game. Allies would build one army and thenonce killedwould literally stop playing. Like the HD versionthe Definitive Edition allows you to choose from CD AI and even the HD AI if you choosebut they have their updated version as well. I have yet to play with the updated AIso I can't speak as to its nature. But once you choose the CD AIthe option sticks (unlike the HD versionwhere you had to choose it every time). All the commands work and have been updated with new voiceover. HoweverI couldn't find the taunts (Edit: Nevermind! I simply couldn't find them in the longer list of chat commands. ""Woololo!"" to your heart's content!).there are certain memorable beats to the old tunes that are dulled in the updated version. On one handthe music gets less ""repetitive"" by taming these memorable partsbut on the other hand--the old soundtrack is the best and I want to hear it!the game runs well on its highest settings for me. Every once in a while it'll lag a bit--I think that coincides with autosaves--but not often enough to be an issue. I play on ludicrous size maps with 8 playersso there are always tons of armies and chaos on screen. Speaking of mapsthe selection here is wonderful! All the original types of random maps are hereand there are added types (including ""migration"" mapsthat are low on initial resources and cause you to battle it out while trying to grow your empire). Additionallyyou gain additional options when it comes to the kind of random map you want to play. Selecting water-basedfor one examplewill select all water-heavy types of maps and choose randomly. You can also literally choose each individual type of map you're open to and apply the settings.which is awesome if you like collecting relics to grow your gold reserves. I haven't run low on gold yetand I've played around a dozen maps thus far. Mills and docks now give you the option to reseed farms and fish traps automatically as long as you have the resources--infinitely. The days of crazily clicking to fill your reseed queue are gratefully over. There are tons of mini-map options herebut they've taken away the combat/economic options (Edit: My mistakethey simply moved it to a new toggle button).Sometimes the game suffers from odd glitches where someone will resign and the game won't notify you (you'll just notice their name crossed out in the corner if you select the scores to show up above the mini-map). Every once in a while units will slide across the mapand I've witnessed monks moon-walking more than once. I find both these glitches hilarious and would rather them *not* be fixedto be honest. It only happens once every few hours of playtime so it's more of a pleasant surprise than an immersive-breaking experience. Finallythe achievements are more completionist-based and don't require millions of hours of playtime like the HD version (play 1000 games as all empires!)thank the gods.so I want it treated right. The Definitive Edition does it justiceand the helpful updates add so much value. To those of you who love this game alreadysupport this version for as much money as you can spare. To anyone who hasn't played Age of Empires II and is looking to startthis is a great opportunity to do so. Take noticedevelopers: THIS is how you update an old beloved classic.I bought this as an homage to my fatherwho died of cancer on the 3rd of July this yearit was one of his favourite games.and he played it for as long as I can remember. From the point where I was old enough to play games I would be sitting on his lap as we used to challenge each other in games like AoECossacksDay of DefeatAmerica's Army and Command & Conquer.and while I still only have a measly 7 hours played on steam he had already played past a thousand hours.but he had already passed for a few weeks at that point. It's one of those things that slip past your mind and you later realize during the moment. Can't explain how sad I was at the moment of realizationknowing my father won't get to play it himself. But knowing him I am sure he would've loved it with these new graphics and settingsand would most likely yet again surpass over a thousand hours.the improvements to the menu and graphics are very welcome. The blur is a bit annoyingbut can be majorly fixed with the sharpendepth of fieldand anti-aliasing options.or for my dad. I just felt a urge to write this ''review''to show how much this game meant to me and to my father. for giving me so many good memories with himalthough most of them are not on the steam version.but I'll be sure to play this a lot for you in your steadsince you are not able to.and for introducing me to many great gamesdad. Some of which are still my favouritesand most likely always will be.When I was a kid I wasted my life away playing AOE:II waiting to finish school..I've played chess forever.  Although I enjoyed games like Caesar IIII am very happy my adult kids talked me into playing AoE II with them.  It's a blast.  I'm 6and it's good for building new neural pathwaystooI'm sure.  So there's that.I highly recommend using the money you get from refunding Warcraft III: Reforged to purchase this product instead.I have spent thousands of hours of my life playing many versions Age of Empires II. No joke. Check my hours counter for the HD edition in my library. I grew up with playing Age of Kings with my friends in grade schoolprocrastinated with the HD edition through high schooland even spent Friday nights in college playing Arabia and CBA. I know how the game probably better than any other video game. And let me say this. Microsoft has done a near flawless job of keeping the 'feel' of the original game in the remakewhile managing to improve the game in almost every aspect.but are brought to new life with incredible vocalsroom filling soundand surprising depth as soon as you load up the game. The music is clean and would fit in any modern game and yet it always stays rooted in the music you remember.the game excels. The devs definitely had a challenge here. Playing the game requires you to be able to quickly identify buildingsunits and terrain at a glance. This means that each building and unit on the field need their own graphical representation. The graphics also had to be reminiscent of the old game to allow players to jump over without much trouble. On top of all thismany of the civilizations have their own architecture styles. Microsoft balanced this perfectly. The units and buildings are fresh and look nice from a graphical point of viewbut are similar enough to the old game that there is no problem jumping from one version to the next. A+ work from Microsoft here.v3v3or 4v4 in deathmatch or random map and play a person your rank is huge. Totally cuts down on the lobby system found in HD. The lobby does stick around for those who want to play custom scenarios or play weird setting games with their friend. The matchmaking mode tended to get me in a game in as little as  minutes. Not super fastbut certainly serviceable. Great system all around.get caught on each other in big groupsand would generally bump into each other making life rough. In DEthe pathfinding is at least slightly better in worst case scenario and in best case it flows smoothly and in a more impressive way. There is still the odd villager who wanders out into the middle of nowherebut more often than notunits moveattackand respond much better to user inputs.but has good settings for both audio and video.this game is worth the $15 if you already own the gameand the $0 if you didn't. The developers clearly worked their butts off to make this game spectacular.A simple but detailed explanation of whyafter having played both versionsI prefer Definitive Edition (DE) instead of 013 Edition:forcing you to either order your villagers to re-seed themor to mash the ""queue re-seed"" button in the mill. In DEyou can set the mills to automatically re-seed.but in the latterthe villager will move to build the last building you placed down. If you order several buildingsthey will stop constructing the building they're already working on to go build the new one. In DE they will wait to finish the first building before starting on the next one.and to a lesser extentone team from another. DE's graphics are much clearer so it is very easy to distinguish unit type/team.FAR more customizable than 013 Edition. Not just with the settings (graphicsUIand controls are much more changeable) but especially with creating a gamenamely win conditionsstarting conditionsmap sizesunit restrictionsetc. You can adjust many more settings to make a new game into whatever kind of scenario you want. Also you can see what the map types actually look like in DE.you have to play hide and seek with each one to count them.as well as less repetitive music. Both game's soundtracks are goodbut I find having the DE soundtrack playing in the background to be more enjoyable. This point is pure preference.but DE's graphics are significantly easier on the eyes and prettier.Timelessbest way to spend quarantineI've bought this game more times than skyrim+ Improved command queue (units start to execute the queue on the first click instead of waiting for a confirmationcan queue different types of commands);for example)rushingdefending against rushesfast castling.plus new campaigns.Reading the reviews of this game remind me of my father as well. He also used to be play this game so much before and after I was born. My mother once complained to me that he was so keen on the game that she had to take care of me alone when I was still a baby. When I grew a little olderI always spent the afternoon sitting next to him and watch him play this game and brag about his brilliant strategies. He delved into the game so much just like any gamer today: playing with friends in LAN or onlinereading the lengthy documents analyzing each civilization's traitschallenging the hardest AIs in 1v8s... He likes to crash enemies using the French cavaliersand I probably watched him doing so hundreds of times.he is now busy working and supporting the whole family in another city most of the time and hardly had any time for home and certainlyfor any games. On very rare occasionshe comes back from workwalking into my room and asks what I am playing. It is impossible for him to learn something new nowso I bought the 013 version for both of us. He still picks France every timeusing the same strategies and brags about his skills whenever he wins a small battle. Knowing that his play is actually quite outdated and slowI somehow still loves to watch him play for a few more hours.and can't wait to tell him the upgraded graphics version of this classic game.I believe a lot of people has so many memories stored in it. Fathers and sonsbrothers and cousinschildhoods and youths. For meit is part of my happy childhood; for my fatherit is part of his wonderful youth.i spent $0 on a game i already own so i wouldn't have to click the reseed farm button once every few minutesThe hours kind of speak for themselves at this point.This is everything a remaster is supposed to be. You remember playing this game over a decade agoand the graphics weren't ""that bad"". But nostalgia is a cruel mistress. You play the original againand you can barely stand it.which was alrightplayable. But thenthe real remasterthe Definitive Editionyou start playing the game and it FEELS like it used to feel. Like it is supposed to look. It is quite obviously way better than it used to bebut it FEELS the same.and want to play it againthis won't disappoint you. Especially with the distinct lack of RTS games in the last decade or sothis still holds true as one of the best ones.Growing upI wasn't often allowed on the computer due to my own stubborn nature and daydreaming. Howeverthe first time I saw this game as a free demo and I downloaded itI couldn't stop playing it. I played the demo so much any chance I was allowed and even got my father to play too. We'd sit and talk while I watched him play for hours. Coming up with different strategies and joking about walling off the AIwhich we did. Often.eager to install and play it. And play I did. I remember playing the Aztec campaignsJoan of ArcSaladinrandom maps... I couldn't get enough. It was so much fun.decades laterI have supported this franchise since that fateful day I just installed a demo. I own almost all iterations of the franchise and do not plan to stop supporting it. This game was my and manymany otherschildhood. It helped me through a lot of very hard times through my life and to this dayI still enjoy just playing a random map or booting up the campaigns I've played hundreds of times just to listen to the dialogue and the storytelling.and it would be a disservice to not buy it and try it for yourself or even betterwith friends!THIS IS HOW YOU REMASTER A GAME! Age of Empires  was the game many of us grew up with and had endless hours of fun playing. The 013 remaster was ok I guess but this one really brings it to 019 standards. All the while keeping TRUE to what made it great in the first place. That is an important point to remember for developers - innovate where necessary but don't remove stuff people like just because. It is a hard balance to achieve but Microsoft has achieved it with this one.I've been playing this game for over  decades and I'm happy to report that I still suck at multiplayer.I'm 67 yrs young. This is one of the first games I played. I've always enjoyed it!!If only Blizzard could have made Warcraft 3:Reforged as well as Microsoft redid Age of Empires "
1,"I'm an old guy who has been playing computer games since the days of the BBC computer When I grew up in the late 1960's I liked reading classic science fiction - and playing Stellaris is like being immersed in one of those books James Blish or Isaac Asimov would have LOVED this game!I went in trying to build an enlightened utopia With blood and sweat I built a federationusing diplomacy and trade to scramble my way to the top despite warmongers all around me Then the Unbidden came My territory was overrundefenses were wiped outand my allies began to fracture But I held on Planet after planet was wiped out but I held onto my corebuilding up the mother of all fleets I lost upwards of 80% of my territory and my stockpiles of resources were nearly exhaustedbut I sent forth my fleet in a last glorious charge against inevitability I cut through tens of thousands of Unbidden shipsfleet after fleetuntil I arrived at the doorstep of the Dimensional Portal only to find that a rival empire had claimed a critical star system and closed their bordersblocking my path My resources were nearly exhaustedand my fleet was months away from crumbling under its own weight so there was no time to find a diplomatic solution I declared war Alasthe allies in my federation were too cowardly to provoke another power while they were still in the midst of pushing back the Unbidden so I had to make a hard decision I left the Federation that I had built and given everything to and declared war on my own As my new enemy scrambled and threatened to overrun what little I had leftmy fleet Last Hope pushed through the one troublesome system and then to the Dimensional Portal - the genesis of the Unbidden threat that had all but destroyed my civilization I gave the order and prayed Before I knew ituntold thousands of my people were dead floating in foreign spacebut the portal was destroyed It was over Not just the Unbidden threatbut my empire I had no wealthno territoryno federationand my shattered fleet was in no shape to fight a war on its own Then I saw it An achievement: ""Victorious""Buy on sale Buy DLC on sale Sit down for a thousand hours and question how did it come to thisI don't care I just play games but I feel like I should give this one a reviewprobably fineshed it a hundred timesstill find excitiment because you can't memorize what tech will come next because it's largely chanceI wake up at 10 Am to play and its midnight before I realize I did'nt do my hwss of space battles probably take up 5 Gb of my computer spacelots of contentlots of optionslots of planetslots of specieslots of ways to playgenocideslaverywarcrimesfr my biggest problem with the game istg I cant even enjoy playing I set me resolution to really low and my computer aint even that bad although I suspect its just my 8Gb rameven on ensign (normal) difficulty Although its just an Ai and you can outsmart themplanets half terraformed show up on the galaxy map in their star system posistions)there is really nothing wrong with this gameexcept lag But thats just performance the actual game is the best I've ever played I've never had so much fun playing by myselfwhy the fuck would I buy this game?

It seems so overwhelming at firstbut you'll eventually learn a great way to manage trade routes You'll be making sick profit AND training your admirals (Patrols do this now!) outside of wartime real quickly! Takes a few decades to get used to and everyone has their own creative methods to manage it wellwhat are these performance issues you mentioned?""[/h1]ESPECIALLY at the launch of 22 The issues made the game nearly unplayable for the first couple weeks of Megacorps launch and took awhile to get going Eventually patches made performance pretty great for Medium/Largewhich is honestly enough for the full meat of the game Recommend Huge only for multiplayer lobbies with good computer tbhI can't believe I didn't give Stellaris a review to this date I'll keep it short and sweetIMOa well-executed blend of 4X and Grand Strategy genres What really makes it shine is its exploration layerthe sheer volume of customization options and possibilities in its sandbox galaxy and emergent storytellingStellaris as a whole is hard to review The game itself is massive in scopeand over 880 hours (at time of writing) is hard to sum up in a character-limited review There's a meme for Hearts of Iron veterans where the ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe"" clip from Bladerunner plays while they recount their experiences Stellaris is the same way: over 800 hours inand just when I think I've seen it allsomething radically different pops up that shatters my expectations I've seen startup empires get confined to 4 systems by mining drones surrounding them on 6 sides I've seen AI suicide thousands of strength worth of fleets into a leviathansolely because they were too lazy to path around it I've seen multiple federations formdisbandrecruit outcast members of the opposite sideand collapse again in a single playthrough I've seen gas giants act as unofficial wormholesand fallen empires fully surrender after losing a single space battle I've seen countless AI uprisings spawn in with more fleets than the entire Contingency/endgame crisis combinedonly to have them utterly collapse the next month from lack of economy Stellaris can be a symphony of discordbetrayaland stupidityand I love finding new ways to both break the gameand watch the game break itself I willhoweversay this: Stellaris will not be for everyone It took me over 50 hours to secure my first winback in the early days of 19 & 20 Successful players will need a mix of patiencestubbornnessclever thinkingand extensive research via the wikiwhere you take a fledgling planet and turn it into a sprawling galactic empire or more likely die trying You control literally every aspect of your empire: how your government is set upwhere your pops livehow they're treatedwhat they researchwhat planets they colonizeand how you deal with the galaxy around you There are some automated aspects when it comes to ship design & planet/sector managementbut these are almost always less efficient than player-controlled choicesand thus are best given as little automation as possible With that saidthere's a massive amount of information constantly being thrown at the player throughout the gameeven enough to make veterans stumble from time to time The tutorial by itself is insufficient in preparing the player for the full burdens of managing an empire all on their ownespecially when dealing with the hidden interactions between traitsethics& research specialtiesand thus an extensive reading of the wiki is highly recommendedand predictably unpredictable Everyone has different views regarding the AIwith personal skill and playstyle usually weighing heavily on their opinions From personal experiencethe AI can be compared to an early-mid tier playerdepending on difficulty modifiers They can utilize basic functionality like colonizing planetsutilizing relationships/tradingbuilding fleetsetcbut they tend to have glaring issues that can be exploited Specificallythey tend to have issues creating & maintaining their economyleaning more towards early gains for later lossesand panic spam specific structures when certain resources start running low At times they'll colonize planetsbut not properly construct infrastructure on them I've never seen an AI build a titan or colossus that wasn't a Fallen Empire They're completely inflexible in terms of ship designfavouring point defense to a frankly ridiculous degreeand won't change their initial build based off external factors They also tend to build way over their fleet capand thus bankrupt themselves economically as time goes on And finallytheir relationships with others is extremely fickle at bestmaking & break rivalries/alliances/non-aggression pacts constantly With that saiddifficulty modifiers giving passive economic & research buffs can help even the scales with them The old problems still exist with thembut are less damning Grand Admiral difficulty can absolutely wreck all but the strongest buildsand a mega federation can easily end a gameno matter how strong you are Make no mistakethere will always be a challenging difficulty for all players With that saidit's perfectly acceptable to find and stop at one that you find both challenging & enjoyable For meit's a 2300-2350 scaling Admiral game on a small galaxywith 025 planet spawns and 05 hyperlane density Your mileage may varyas there are muchmuch bigger galaxy sizes to choose from provided you have the time & energy to complete themuseless early techs like ""energy siphon""the varied usability of missiles & the complete brokenness of strike craftand a host of visual & gameplay issues existed even when I was playing at the end of 19and still do to this day The problem is that the devs seem to live in their own worldand think that constantly reworking everything will somehow nullify old gameplay issuesespecially when it comes to balance decisions Like for examplestrike craft have been broken for a long time nowbecause their AI is scatterbrained and they fly too far from combat to be of any use But instead of just fixing their AIthe devs are planning to re-purpose starport-based strike craft to instead guard trade routes This is nicebut doesn't change the fact that they still target incorrectly and continue to be useless for mobile carriers Similarlythe tile system is to be replaced entirelyto try and fix the AI's colonizing issues and the sector manager's overall efficiency flawsbut this doesn't change the fact that both are still awful at managing their economies as a whole This is perhaps my biggest issue with Stellarisand Paradox in general: they seldom fix anything that requires more than changing one or two lines of codeand instead seem to think that reworking everything is preferable to just fixing what's already there There's an unreal amount of oldbusted relics from previous patches left in the gamestill as broken as the day they were introducedbut left ignored by a company that refuses to take a couple months off from developing new cosmetic DLC and simply fix what already existsand I wouldn't have sunk almost 900 hours into it if I didn't enjoy it But the last few months of minor changes and planned reworks haven't given me much hope for Paradox's vision of the future Thus I'll re-emphasize that Stellaris requires a lot of determinationand a bit of thick headednessin order to fully learn how to play it and circumvent the remaining bugs/gameplay imbalances I very much enjoy the gameit's teachings about basic philosophies & politicsand the stories I've created over the dozens of empires I've built & destroyed But I have to admit: I laughed at the 19ers who complained that 20 was ruining the game they'd come to loveas I thought 19 was a broken mess and that 20's changes were all right on the money But after 880+ hours learning 2022 now imminently looms on the horizonthreatening to vastly change the game's economy & take away a large portion of player control via the tile system removal and I can't help but feel a little anxious about the future This is perhaps the biggest surprise that Stellaris has given me; the fact that I now feel so much sympathy for the 19ersand worth your time to learn if you're determined enough But I personally will be waiting on the sidelines with cautious optimismhoping for the best with 22 but preparing for the worstEdit: As of writing this reviewI have 20 hours logged in Stellaris  Stellaris has been out for 29 hourshappy people don't  I don't want rebellionsthose make people even more unhappy  If I took ""Spiritualist"" I'd get a nice 5% bonus to happiness  Even betterif I grabbed ""Fanatic Spiritualist"" I'd get a whopping 10% bonus to happiness and wouldn't have to worry about rebellions everwhich adds +5% happinessand the charismatic traitwhich gives everyone on a planet a +1% happiness bonus for every member of my race on that same planetnational ethicsand even my form of governmentI was able to get a total +25% boost to my happiness  I ended up as a fanatically spiritualpacifistic race of charming people who just like getting along with everyone  To top it offI found the most fitting racial portrait - a classic grey alienthe kind you see in all of those old movies and tv clips about ""Alien abductions""  Classic graysbut with a bigdoofy grin slapped permanently across their facesso I was stuck surrounded in a sea of AI  It didn't matter what I didmy people remained happy  I manipulated my neighbors and pitted them against each other for my own gain  I created a superalliance with my angry fungus neighbors and invaded the birds who were restricting my movementdistributing them across my empire while stripping away their power and influence even on their homeworld  I shipped them across my empirebalancing them with my own grinning populace across the empire - we live on the same kind of worldafter allso happywho hadn't achieved spaceflight yet  I set up a research post and began lightly observing them  Thenof courseI began the process of bringing them up to speed with the rest of the galactic communitynow:  My friends are politicking on the other side of the galaxymaking and breaking alliances in power struggles that send ripples far enough that I've seen their effects over in my corner of the galaxywhere I've spent my time well:  genetically modifying the subjugated aliens of my empire to be happyjust like usI have been awake for 40 hours and it's finals weekfinding several of my friends  MeanwhileI enlightened 2 more species and was working on a 3rd when we saved and quit  They were fully integrated into my empire very quickly but we only bothered to modify one of themas the other was naturally happythe angry fungusand I all immediately set about molding our corner of the galaxy's nations to mirror our own by invading them and ""liberating"" all of their planets under new governments we set up to be more sympathetic to our ethicsmoaningand there was much gnashing of teeth as they were slowly ground down by a non-player Empire that was consistently thrashing their armies untilafter 15 years of warthey managed to research better shield systems to counter their powerful lasers and turn the tide of the war and secure them a white peacetook one planetliberated another under its own new governmentand vassalized himAs a new player to StellarisI have no historical perspective to complain about changes Games like these are not normally ones I play That being saidI very much enjoyed playing this game I appreciate that I can pause the game in single player and take the time to set actions for everything before unpausing The anomolies are fun to explore Awakened empires were a pain in the beginning because the game doesn't warn you that out of a 200 year gamean empire will ""awaken"" within the last 30 years to absolutely dominate and ruin your game if you're not prepared A warning or heads up for that would have been nice I do wish the 10+ DLC's were not so expensive per piece I'm not convinced to buy them unless they go on saleI love Stellaris and think its an amazing space strategy game The dlc's add amazing content to the game that always makes me come back and play a couple hundred's hour more The game isn't perfect and it has some flaws that you should know aboutthe engine is pretty bad since you can be running the best cpu and gpu known to man and the game will lag like crazy during the endgame forcing you to play on the smaller galaxiesthe Ai is kinda trash forcing you to mostly use mods to make them more entertaining and a force to be reckoned withplanetsbackground look 5 times better to making the Ai better to helping you create your faction and adding more events to keep you entertain during mid-game Trust me you will want some mods for this game-Play as a Reptile raceYou don't actually winyou just get bored and try again with a different set upThis is the

What's not to recommend?from the economy through to the relative silver rates for craftinggrindingand everything except huntingis mathematically-balanced to a genius level degree. The worldquestsand classes have an amazing degree of depth.through to the constant shower of micro-rewards; need to login 24/7; gambling-based enhancement; and exponential sunk-costthis is a game designed to exploit your every weakness to take out your credit card.I think the same applies to this game. And much like drugsyou'll probably do better if you don't try them in the first place.Sowhere to even begin. I guess the most important thing here is that this is certainly not the MMO for everybody. This MMO manages to pack in something for every kind of player out therebut that actually doesn't mean it will appeal to everyone.I'll cover the topic of the pricepointsince in the very most lenient sense hereit's ""variable"".nothing. That's pretty handy. The price point is at least low enough that for most peopleeven if they don't like the gamethey won't have lost out on much. Nowchances arethe price point is that low because THERE ARE MICROTRANSACTIONSIF YOU WANT THEM. I'm putting this at the beginning of the review because I know that this will either immediately deter peopleor encourage them to hear me out on this. The best way I saw these described was as ""conveniences"". You can get items that rival the cash shop itemsbut it will take timeand it will take effort. Butthere is nothing to stop someone from simply getting a headstart on the game by dropping a little extra money on the game. Is that bad? Wellat a $10 initial price pointI don't think sobecause almost all of the cash shop items are convenience itemsi.e. streamlining workersgetting a nicer boat without investing time into itgetting gear to speed up fishing initiallyetc. The game counteracts this by allowing a lot of things to be completed AFKsuch as fishingor even autolooping a running path to level up your stamina (seriouslyyou can just have your character run infinitely between two points and get levels out of itI can't make this up). Need to level your mount? Check the ""auto feed"" optionstock up on carrotsset an autoloopand go sleep or do productive things while your character travels between points A and B and your horse learns new skills. So honestlythe cash shop items are certainly a thing which most people would look down onbut I haven't even seen the need for them. That saidI could have higher tolerance for grinding (see my Maplestory hourslet's not talk about it).on the topic of grindingthis IS a korean MMOand it's gonna involve a lot of grinding. The AFK system is honestly a god-sendI'm telling you. Howeverthe combat is very dynamic and frankly the best I've ever seen in an MMO (it does seem very similar to TERAbut definitely more rewarding and satisfying). For skills grindinga fair amount of it can be done while tabbed outso the grindy feeling there is alleviated to a fair extent.this game does a very good job of letting you choose your own playstyle. Want to make it to the second town and then level all the way to 55+ and make millions by fishing? Surego ahead. Want to immediately start a farm and create a monopoly on food goods in the player marketplace? That works too. Set up trade routes between nodes and make all your money and experience through buying low and selling highit doesn't matteryou get rewarded with level exp for so many things in this gameyou can choose how you want to play the game. You can even treat it almost as a single-player game with the Black Spirit quest lineso play how you want to. And heyif you're still into the kill-quest style MMOthat's all here for you tooand you won't even have to touch the other skills. It's relieving to play an MMO that lets you decide how you want to play it.which entails warring over territories or capturing areas to claim tax to pay guild members and such. I don't know too much about thisbut from what I've viewedit seems incredible to wage all-out-war with other guilds for essentially control over money. The PvP seems to be a big part of this gameand I'm hoping to make it to that end-game experience soon. And yesbefore you askthese wars DO entail fortscannonsarmiesetcwhich just seems super awesome. Other guilds though seem to take the game casuallyand only want a community to play withso that's diversified as well.the combat is fluid and feels OH SO GOODand the AFK feature is even enhanced by an option to minimize the game to the tray. The chat is very spammy with system notifications when you first join the gamebut the settings menus help with all that and it should take you just a couple trial-and-errors to figure out what you do want to see broadcast and what you don't want to see. The quest handling is nice and will even autopath you to destinationsand despite minor environmental hookups (I got stuck on a staircase once) it's a very reliable system and can streamline the early game.so after all of thiswhy can't I recommend it to everyone? I meanI'm giving it a thumbs upam I not? Wellit's because there is very little explained to you in this gameand that's probably because if they didyou wouldn't ever end the tutorial. The game has so much complexity to it that you're going to want to have YouTube openwhatever databases or guides you can finda friend on skypereally anything to help you understand a new part of the game you've decided to dabble in. For somethat's incredibly daunting and I can't say everyone would enjoy the game based on this aspect. And this isn't me saying ""GO BACK TO YOUR BABY MMOS YA BABIES"" I mean seriouslythis game is a lot to take in and I'm surprised even I can handle it. While I believe you can take the game in any way you likeyou still might get curious one day and find a whole new aspect to the game that doesn't suit your fancyor it's just so horrifically complicated at first that you aren't going to understand it until your 15th fail stack. Now personallyI don't mind having to research an aspect of a gameand I even personally have a journal where I jot down notes for all sorts of games I play (I'm a huge nerdI know this). But some people want to hop in and just play to end-gamewhich is okay. Having to find and research your way to the end-game isn't always funand I understand that.my final verdict is this: if any of this sounded appealing to yougive it a shot. Given that it casts it's net very wideyou can probably find something you'd enjoy in this game. Butbe prepared to do some researchas some of the time you're just going to be confusedno matter how much experience you have with MMOs or in-game economies. If the mention of a cash shop that DOES benefit players deterred you entirelythenah wellthat's fairand I'd even encourage you to look elsewhere. Despite it being solely convenience itemsI can't dispute the fact that they do exactly that. And finallyif all of this sounded appealing to youI almost plead with you to play thisas I ended up finding the MMO I was looking forand I hope you do to.I realized I totally forgot to mention that the Black Desert Online site DOES ALLOW A 7-DAY TRIAL. Please notethe account used for that trial and the account used in Steam CANNOT BE LINKEDbut this is a way for you to try the game and see if you like it! If the $10 or the cash shop is concerninggive the trial a chance and seeand then decide what medium you would want to purchase it on. I'd recommend using the trial and then coming to steam to start anew and know what direction you want to pursuebut please keep this in mind! Hope this helps!LOOK AT MY HOURS PLAYED. I waited 15 months to write a review. I've pretty much done it all. I'm running around at softcap with pretty much all content acquired. This game IS damn amazing. Today24th of August 2018they made the game truly pay to win. I'm not talking ""added a ghillie suit to the cash shop"" or anything like thatI mean full-blown swipe your credit card to become stronger than anyone who put effort into the game or is skilled at pvp. If you as a gamervalue skill and talent over who has richer parents than for the love of god stay away. There is so much more fun to be had elsewhere. This game is officially dead with this change. I urge all players to leave a negative review to alert people who may fall for this scam-game.but you should try not to forget the developers; ""Pearl Abyss"" and the Publisher ""Kakao Games"" as we certainly will see them again in the future to further scam their playerbase once again. If there is any comment you read about BDO that you pay attention to; its this one. DO NOT. I REPEAT: DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME/MONEY.I have now 5.6605 hours on this account besides this I have a Beta account that I played on when the game came out. Aka let me tell you about the game that will make you lose your mind in multiple ways.travelingfollowing a storyquesting and lifeskilling you will be drawn to this game from the get go. Also you can drop all your idea's of your perfect E-Girl in the character design.You need to understand three things about this game.butit's a glorified interactive casino. Everything in this game is RNG dependant.this game is extremely addicting. At first it may not be apparentbutif you're running a beefy PC your electric bill will inform you that this game is consuming your life.this game has the potential to be extremely expensive or extremely cheap while providing the same level of ""fun.""  The ""Pay to Win"" aspect of this game solely exists in the form of convenience. It is 100% impossible for you to spend $100000 an expect to be the best geared player in the game. That saidit is 100% POSSIBLE for you to spend $100000 and feel like you still need to spend more.roughly $150 in order to have enough pets (for auto-looting)carry weightand inventory space. Howeverif you're not a ""hard core"" player the 4 pets you get from questing and the additional 1 pet (5 total) you eventually get from your log-in bonus are more than adequate to keep up with most people's grind habits. The additional inventory slots you get from questing are also more than adequate for most people. Additionallyas a new player you receive several free Value Packs.if you focus your first month of the game on learning and gearing up you will easily find yourself having an income high enough to purchase a new value pack every month with in-game currency. In the event that you are a little slower on the uptakeyou could join any guild that offers 5m silver / day daily pay and push all of that money into a city storage you don't often visit. Thenat the end of the monthyou will find that your guild has effectively paid for your value pack.thenyour entry fee is closer to the ball park of $150~250 depending on your Luck with obtaining Tier 4 petswhich is a gambling process involving purchasing multiple of the same type of pet and combining them for a chance at increasing their Tier. You're also going to want as many character slots as you can so that you 1) camp every boss site2) have a daily/weekly life skill character at each major resource hotspotand 3) increase your family fame fund (daily silver awarded to you at log-in). As a Hard Core player you're also going to keep your Silver focused on obtaining stronger / better gear so you'll have a recurring payment of $15/mo ($45/90-day) Value Pack and an additional $25/mo for Blessing of Kamasylve (increases drop rate). The Kamasylve cost is mitigated by events where they give 7~15 day kamas out like candy so you can think of this in annual terms at about $150/year. As a Hard Core player you also will want tolater onprotect your TET and PEN enhancements using Cron stones. If you're lucky enough to be in a siege or node warring guild you might already have enough SILVER to buy Cron stones. Howeveronly about 20% of players fall into this category. For everyone else there's Master Card. Reach into that wallet and spend roughly $68 on Costumes to extract Cron stones from PER ATTEMPT. Remember what we said about gambling? You can absolutely spend a million dollars here and never get any further.depending on your definition of Pay to Win. But consider the following: if you're not a hard core player then you probably aren't ever going to bother with high level enhancing. This means if you decide to get stronger you're probably going to spend in-game currency. Mister Mastercard might spend  $10000 on his first PEN item. You're going to spend about 17 billion silver on your first PEN. Most casual players at end game can rack in 400~800m/week which means you will see that PEN in about 28 weeks. Most Pay 2 Win type of people are not wealthy enough to drop $360/week into a video game. Do they exist? Surebutyou have the same chance of meeting Clint Eastwood in Japan as you do of meeting one of those players. At this stage in the gamewho is to say the person you run into isn't just someone who has played since launch?  Point isit's not going to affect your experience on way or the other.of the bestof the best. Grinding is for peasantsyou want to make all of your money and obtain all your gear without even leaving Velia. Bad newsbud. This isn't the game for you. The number of Pearl items you can sell is directly affected by the number of characters you have at level cap. If you only get 1 character to level 60 before you decide you're going to be a wallet warrioryou're only able to sell 10 Pearl Items / week. That means you are hard-capped at 3.35 billion silver / week on money. Your first PEN item is going to take you a minimum of 5 weeks to pay with cash BUT WAIT! There's more! As of writing this post there have only ever been 121 PEN Kzarka Blades sold on the central market place. Meaningeven if you have the silver you are still relying on the rest of the community to make the item.so what? You'll just Master Card your way through the TET and PEN attempts. Wellwe know of at least 1 player on the NA server who hasso farfailed 85 times in a row on safe TET attempts. But let's say you don't have the worst lucklet's say you have fairly average luck. You are going to attempt about 8 times for TET and about 20 times for PEN. If all of these are going to be safe attempts that's $1360 for your PEN after you spend $240 on your TET. For simplicity sake let's call it $1500 per PEN.. this will see you at $10500 for PEN Armor and Weapons. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!!or break without crons. Let's be generous and say you have average luckyou're using cronsit's all pay 2 winand we'll call it a conservative $2000 per PEN accessory. That's an added $6the cost of outright pay 2 win in this game is a paltry $16000 for the gear BUT DON'T STOP THERE!  Did you think having full PEN would make you formidable in the game? HA! You still need your Dream Horse.  Let's be generous with that too and tack on another $2000. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!! You need a Frigate! And your Frigate has to be the best of the best of the best.  Let's call it $1000 per piece of gear to hit +10 (frigate equivelant of PEN) and ignore the cost of actually buying blue gear. So there's another $4000. So now we're at $21000 to pay to win the game.you fall to nobody! So you swipe your card.....  only to find that every single item required to make that ship can only be obtained through Bartering. A long process that requires your physical labor.guy. You have to grind. Because unless you are level 62+ you aren't scary even with full PEN. The cost to make you a God amongst players your same level without lifting a finger? $10~20000 USD. The cost to make you useful in a siege or node war? Priceless.would take a minimum of 65 weeksand the margin between you and the Non-P2W player after 65 weeks will be negligible.This game is beautiful and Fun for a couple hundred hours but :that you might aswell not bother;dungeons or anything of the sort ; ( All content updates are essentially new places to grind your life away)however  the Devs are disconnected from the player base and seem more preoccupied with adding pay to win items and remastering the already beautiful graphicsinstead of adding worthwhile content for PvEand making progression smoother ( or actually possible ) without spending hundreds of insert your currency here to get the slightest upgrade .i also forgot to mention how to make any decent amount of money: you have to Afk grind professions. Try having your computer running the entire month. Food ? who needs that. Electricity bills will be #1 priority)I'm not saying the game is P2WBlack Desert Online is a fantastic idea and world settingthe combat is immersive with a high skill capthe character creation is the best of any game released to dateits enhancing system is horrid while still being extremely unique and what keeps people playingand the game looks absolutely stunning with a welcoming community.while the enhancing system FEELS extremely rewarding when an enhancement succeeds you still end up losing millions on that enhancement. The games accessories break when an enhancement is failed unless cron stones are used (We'll cover these later) This means that if you have a boss gear accessory that is Tri(+18) and attempt to go to tet(+19) and your enhancement fails you've potentially lost BILLIONS of silver. The same applies to weapons but usually its just hundreds of millions not billions(Unless we're discussing a pen(+20) attempt) This will allow us to discuss the next topic. THE GRINDPearl itemsthis means investing losts of money into the game (about $200 for mob grinders and $400-$600 for lifeskillers) All these items are pay for convenienceKakao makes its game unbearable without these pearl shop items. A must for all players is Petsat least tier 2 for all of them(about $60-$80) Pets are absolutely necessary to your success in this gamethey will loot items for you as well as give you boosts to certain xp values or knowledge gain chance. Lifeskillersyou're going to have to spend money on at least one pearl shop costume that are NOT able to be listed on the marketplace for silver. These costumes run about $22 USD and are essential for lifeskillers. This game is pay to win when it comes to maintaining a higher skill score. Outfit sets(cosmetic items that boost xp stats that are a pearl shop item BUT can be purchased from the marketplace using precious silver that could be going to enhancing) Can be melted down for CRON stones. Cron stones protect the enhancement level on an item from dropping on a failed enhancement chance or prevent an accessory from breaking on a failed enhancement. Which meansspending IRL money will save you potentially BILLIONS of silver that can be used to enhance other gear. Another ptw item from the item shop is Artisans memories. What these do is they make an item restore 4x their value on a repair. Meaning someone that spends money on these spends 4x less on repair materials for their boss gear which is extremely substantial.it is essentially having a second job and sinking every waking moment into this game if you have plans to progressI can not recommend this game to the average gamer despite how much I enjoy it. The enhancing system is this games downfall and its risethe pay to win is too much handle if you're a ftp player and Kakao is a greedy company out for that dough. If you like grind maybe this game is for you(I'm okay with the grind but find myself taking breaks lasting for a few months before picking the game up again). But if you dontDo not purchase this game.I'm not saying this game is P2WPROShands downfocusing on killing enemies instead of lvling uprealisticoriginalgearand other things you find useful in your journeymaking you feel like the Pay2Win claim is quite a bit undermined.i find a game where i actually have great use of renting armor. It's more or less free as wellas you get back the 'contribution points' you spent on renting the armor when returning it. This system is great and beginners like myself should take great advantage of it.but focus on the cutscenes and the shadowy companion. Watching him grow and transform is really excitingand it makes you want to keep going just to see how far does this little guy really golots of fun topics and trash talkdiscussionshelpand otherbut it's very easy to list your own items and quickly gain currency to buy yourself new equipmentwhile the really good items have their strong values for the hardcore peopleWoW being first with FFXIV following just afterand then comes either this game or Runescape. Should tell you why so many people play italthough can be hard to navigatehas about everything you could need if you can't find something otherwiseyou have a hotbar. I recommend learning the basic abilities while putting the more complex-performed abilities on the hotbaras well as utilities like the horse flute if you've got an explorer's package and health potions.then monsters get progressively tankier up untill 40where they start to get slightly more difficult. Up at 50 you're likely to die quite a few times if you're not paying attention to your health. Monsters get much tankier and do harsh damage. This is not really a conbut this curve is rather quick and can take you by surprise.it doesn't appear to be much connection in terms of doing activities together. It's focused on yourself and your journey is going the much like a single-player experiencebut the world is still filled with life. Guilds and PvPas well as wars is where the game shines and brings you out of the lonely wandering.which rarely a standard gaming rig can handleclasses tend to be unbalanced in PvP and 1v1's are rarely a fair matchup.such as your horse is in the stable in the town you left it at4000 metres awayor your good weapon you couldn't equip at the time is a 15-minute walk away because you had put it in the storage in some city you probably can't even rememberthere is a lot of non-english speaking people in the global chats. Primarily GermansDutchand Polishas well as Frenchavoiding global channels from being spammedbut it can be frustrating because there's lots of great memes and conversations you might want to take part inbut you have to make the decision between chilling over there or saving your energy for lifeskills or conversing with NPCsmost probably due to an attempt to stop global chats from spamming ''WTB/WTS''although it still happensone thing it gives you early on is a 7-day Value Pack. It's greatreallybut the problem is that this is a marketing strategy in order to get you used to having the benefits of the pack straight off the batso once it actually depletes you feel like you're playing at a 'disadvantage' when in reality you're playing vanilla. It's an attempt at making you want to subscribe for the value pack. If you can see past thisthen it is only more power to you because you get a 7-day Value Pack free! Additionallyit also gives you an idea of what the Value Pack offers.which might be problematic for somebecause the character i play is not even the same gender so how would i personalize it to my liking to get myself in to the world? I forgot to mention that some classes have a male/female equivalentsuch as the Kunoichi being a female version of the Ninja- However Kunoichi still differentiates at lvl 56 with the awakeninggetting a chakram instead of a katan and turns more AoE-based and ranged. While most clases have a gender equivalentthey still do differ just a tad bit.really do need pets and potentially weight efficiency. People saying you can buy pearls off the market or pets are kind of - kind of not wrongbecause the problem isn't that you won't be able to afford itthe problem is that everyone has the money for itmeaning as soon as it shows up on the marketit's gone in an instantmaking it very hard to actually buy cash shop items for ingame currencythe amount of hours-vs-price you'll be paying is highly likely to be worth it. Game is flawed and can feel like it's not a full experience just because of how ridiculously huge it is and all the activities to do- Feels like you're basically never going to finishas well as the cash shop makes you feel like you miss out and waste time because you're not paying to have efficiency.but if you pay attentionit really is much more original and not just ''Ugh greatit's that forest area like in all other MMOs''. I usually hate forests in MMOsthey tend to be the most generic and standard template out therebut it reallyreally feels original here. I can't stress that enough. There is a ton of beautiful areas you can just sit down and breathe in for a bit.but i don't have enough spacethe review has reached its cap.First thing is firstI am recommending this game but I caution you to make an informed decision with information listed below.in that this MMO focuses almost entirely on PvP combat and due to this the entire combat system feels very unique.  Instead of quick-slotting abilitiesBDO has a combo system where key combinations cast your abilities.  Learning your class is essential and will have many different learning curves and way of playing.  Rotating cooldown timers is an important part of it for surebut it certainly makes the combat in this game feel better than other MMO titles.  For this reason I would say one of the main reasons I would pick this title over others is the combat.and puts many people off.  Enhancing gear has a percentage chance to failwhich gets larger as the gear gets better.  If you fail an enhancementthe max durability of an item goes down and the only way to repair it is to get a base durability item and use it as a repair material.  This only gets more expensive when you acquire the best in slot equipment.  Additionallyonce you get to the last 4 enhancement levels on a piece of gear each fail will revert the enhancement level back a step.  Players have come up with systems to increase the oddsbut it is always a gamble.  Most players will choose to save their resources and buy gear rather than go through the tedious process of enhancing.  Failing higher level enhancements is extremely taxing to a player's finances.but rather a soft cap where obtaining exp becomes so difficult that the next level is near impossible to reach.  As more players reach these higher levels the cap is raised and as such the gap between new players and old players increases.  The game managers have come up with clever events to try and close this gap and this works to varying extents.or workingwhatever the case is.  Now look if you have the money for the electricity that's fine and all but not everybody does.  It is important to note that these inactive gains add up over time and can give you an edge over players who do not follow suit.but there is no way to trade items between players.  This isn't exclusive to guilds either.  Any items you have that you may even want to sell to your friendyou can't do so for a lower rate.  All player transactions go through an auction housewhich means that there is always a chance the item gets snagged before your friends can buy from you.  I think the idea that guilds cannot share resources between members is a really dumb idea.  I understand why they do thisbut it is quite a change from other MMOs.and it was all uncharted territory.  Progression felt rewarding because once I was strong enough I could hold my ownor maybe even win open world PvP encounters.  This was the case for a whilebut eventually the bar was raisedand winning fights was no longer an option for me.  The answer to this was grinding and pushing to have my gear enhanced but it just became a Skinner box of a video game.but if you're looking for attainable PvE content go somewhere else.  There are very few PvE options available in the end gamebut very few players reach the level at which these areas can be cleared.  This game is for those who like to PvPand I cannot in good faith recommend this to players who want to crawl dungeons as there aren't really any dungeons to crawl.This is a good game to play for about as long as I did. Spend the minimum amount of money to have a fun experience for about 30 days and play until you hit your awakening and when pvp unlocksthen stop. There's nothing new after that except grinding. Don't even worry about trying to make your gear better or getting pets or anything like that as its just a ploy to get you to spend obscene amounts of money and time for a small return. Simply enjoy the game as a single-player story for about 80 hours and then make a new class to see different combat or move on.I'm not saying the game is P2WIf you look at the amount of time and entertainment you get for the priceok it's worthit's an mmo and grindy but you still have fun getting strongers making friends etc.but there comes a time for everyone to know when to put it down.Note to considering buyersthe $10 price tag is false; you'll probably need to end up spending probably another $20 or so to feel like you're not being hindered in terms of bag spaceweightor auto loot speed. This game is an extremely long term game--there are no gear resets when new content drops.then this game isn't for you. But the flip side of that though is thisthe progression is always there. Concerning the length howeverthey did add seasonal servers which slingshot new players to a spot where they can actually start working towards end game gear. When this game first came outyou had to go Rags-to-Riches all by your lonesomebut now it's really not the case.I've heard that they have made ways to get around itbut I personally haven't reached that point--but I have been getting some of said items needed to bypass the RNG.it most definetly is possible BUT it is--in my opinion--a complete waste of money due to how inefficient it is. Though players most certainly can--and a small minority do--buy cash shop items and sell them for in-game moneyyou would probably need to spend no less than $10000 USD to get anything close to end-game gear from 0. So yeahwhales can existbut you likely won't encounter them and they make it so we don't need to pay a subscription to keep the servers running.love being able to play by yourself for high-end contenthaving the option for group PvPand love complicated systemsthis game is likely gonna be a good fit.end-game content requiring groupsor systems that can be learned within a relatively short time spanthis may not be the game for you. This isn't to trash anyone who fits in this category thoughI really want to emphasize that everyone just has fun in a different way :)I have over 3000 hours in this game since early beta and while it is one of my favourite MMO's it has major issues that unless fixed  ruin the game.more nodes without the encumbarance on your contribution amount.Pet CostumesEXP ScrollsInventory ScrollsWeight Limit Increases. There is no limit to the amount of money you can spend in this game for improvements that are so vast it is P2W. Ex. Increase your weight you can grind longerfish longerwithout having to go back and forth. Silver in this game = power the more efficient you are the more power you have access to. People will say this is pay for convenience but when we are talking about  4 - 100x more efficiency I think you can realize for yourself that you won't ever keep up with players for free.spend hours faming materials and building fail stacks so you can eventually succeed.For new players who want to try this game""DO NOT"" buy this game from steam. Go to their website and buy directly there. It is not about how much the game cost or how good or bad the game is. It is about the difference between Steam version and Standalone version. If you try it on steam and later decide to invest time and money into this gameyou will discover that steam players will be missing out on many promotions and freebies. Not game breaking but frustrating.Yes.yes. Is it bad? yes. Is it good? yes. Is it p2w? yes. can i not pay? yes. Will i waste hatefully 5k hours on this game? yes. Will i enjoy it? yes. Am i stupid? yes.I have spent about 1104 hours in Black Desert Online as of this reviewnot grinding mobs or testing my combat against other playersbut in life skilling and questing. Even with the inclusion of built-in tutorial videosvery little in Black Desert Online apart from combat is explained wellthus leading to frequent trips out of the game to learn about everything else.but a lot more convenience items to advance playing the game faster. I will say that you DO NOT NEED to spend an extra dime in order to touch all parts of the game itself.RiftRunescapeor Path of Exile.dogsht game"
1,"I think most of the people who write reviews for this game would back me up on this. PLEASE make a full game based on the rougelike mechanics of the first third of the game.maybe making different selectable hosts with their own boards and rulesor maybe just combining them all to make an endless Inscryption rougelike. I'm in love with the story they created and the card game they put passion into. I just want them to expand on itcould turn into the best card game since YuGiOh or Magic The Gathering.The only bad thing about Inscryption is that you can only play it for the first time once.I really wanted that pirate battle.I played the entire game through in one 10hour sitting and still wanted more when the credits rolled.but I knew I had to give this game one. The game keeps throwing new twists and turns at you the whole way throughproviding a funevolving gameplay experience AND a funevolving story.the less you know the better the game isThis game is just pure amazing. I just wish that this become an actual card game like roguelike or endless mode. I know the point of this game is to focus on the story but the card gameplay was so much fun and thoughtprovoking. I would gladly buy it as a dlcIt is not the classic card game. Mullins has once again managed to bring variety to the game.Go in as blind as possibledon't look anything up and accept the twists and turnsWhile I did love this gameit is not a card game roguelike like the trailers for the game gave offits a game trying to tell a story with card game elements.I would look elsewhere seeing as this game pretty much ends after 1012 hours and the story comes to a conclusion and doesn't have a ton of replay value outside of finding secrets or you really enjoyed the gameplay loop.but this one does give a gameplay loop that has some semblance of replay value if not a ton with the card game.Inscyption is a palette cleanser.Worst part of this game is when it's over. Definitely worth the price tag.excellent experience which I hope gets a spiritual successor or a sequel.if you actively put effort into getting immersed in the audio you'll be rewarded with an unrivalled experience.[b] Sacrifices must be madeâ€¦[/b]wrapped up in a turn based deckbuilding card game roguelike.  If that sounds like a lot to swallowdonâ€™t worryâ€¦â€¦It isbut the game does a fantastic job of scaffolding you up and taking it one step at a time.  You wonâ€™t get very far until you really know what you are doing.wellitâ€™s a Dan Mullins game and secrets and twists in story is kind of his thing.  [i] see Pony Island and The Hex[/i]giving further variations with new cards and mechanics. [/list]of course!  Finding secretsbreaking things and outclassing the NPCs is key if you want to survive and solve the mystery.  I love this about these kinds of games that sway in and out of realitybreaking the 4th wall occasionally and leaving you a bit spooked that someone might be actually watching you. [/list]solve puzzles.  Get up from the card game to walk aroundsolve other puzzles.  Watch an FMV and pause it at the right momentâ€¦â€¦puzzle.  What about this seemingly uninteresting piece of furniture?  Yepitâ€™s a puzzle.  Depending on how deep you want to delve into what the game has to offerthe main story line puzzles range from easy as sacrificing a squirrel for a Stoatall the way up to some real headscratchers.  But if you want to really discover the secrets behind the curtain you are going to have to get your Discord hat on and join the group to add your brain to the think tank. [/list]we have an extremely dark storypsychologically and even visually from time to time.  There is plenty of explicit storytelling but also a lot of things you might need to fill in the gaps on if thatâ€™s your kind of thing too. [/list]taking part in the ARGs and watching Youtube videos I will never really fully understand this game or at the very least see everything that it has to offer.  I wish I had the time to delve into every little facet of the game and discover it all for myself but I donâ€™t.  And this makes me sad. [/list]Jim.â€  As a gameInscryption works very well but as a card game it wonâ€™t really have the draw to keep you coming back for more in that aspect.  There are no new cards to unlock after the credits.  There is no PvP aspectwhich is such a shame because it would be amazing to build your own cards and play against other people online.  So at the end of the day Inscryption is a clever video game with some well thought out card game shell around it.  [/list]do yourself a favourâ€¦.donâ€™t watchread or even glance at anything else related to the game and just grab a squirrela knife and a pair of pliers and sit down at the table with your deck.Mullins continues his trend of not revealing very large portions of the game in the store page.Inscryption is a game that both impressed and disappointed me. When I played the demo I was so excited for the full game. I preordered it (which I dont do alot on steam) and booted it up as soon as I could. What the demo did promise was ultimately delivered. There is a funroguelike card game that makes you think about every card you playwhere you play itand when you play it. I loved the art style and creepy atmosphere. Im a big Binding of Isaac fan and the fact that it was a roguelike where you start again just a little more powerful made me so excited to play it for possibly hundreds of hours. Inscryption is unfortunately not that kind of game.There is nothing to be gained from subsequent playthroughs in terms of deckbuilding or improving your characters ""stats"". The story being told is the main reason to play and once youve seen the story to the creditsthats it. No real reason to play again other than to experience the story after youve forgotten what happens. With that being said I still really enjoyed my roughly 1213 hour experience. There was alot of surprises and things happening to keep you wanting to continue to see what happens next. I hope they come out with a spinoff where its basically the same card game but it focuses more on replayabilty like in the demo and the expand the gameplay further from there.I thought this was going to be just another card game with a creepy settingbut it turned out to be so much more. Could not stop playing once I got past the first third of the game and also couldn't stop smiling. I really don't want to say too much because it's a game that deserves to not be spoiled. Enjoy!What started off as a simpleyet spooky deckbuilding game quickly transforms into so much more. It's clever surprisesand twists and turns in both the narrative and the gameplaykept me engaged and delighted the whole way through. As long as you approach this game with an open mindyou should have a great time with this excellent gem of a video game.Holy shit. Don't look anything up or watch anyone play this before experiencing it for yourself. This is one of the most memorable games I have ever played.One of those ""must play"" games. Unbelievably well done.I have not had the motivation to finish a game for 35 years. That streak has been broken.deeply disturbing exploration into the lives of a cardpackopening youtubers"
1,"I like playing cities alot I have Cerebral Palsy and use a HeadMouse to work the computer  Its one of the few games that will work with my HeadMouse Its hard finding games that I can play because I don't have use of my hands I would recomme it to anyone with a disabilityThis is an outstanding game This is an exceptionally outstanding citybuilder gamein a genre that for too longhas been deeply troubled with over-casualizationpoor optimizationill-thought out conceptsmicrotransactionsand general publisher shenangansand zooming out to broadly appreciate my traffic networkand those were reflected in the game As an exampleI assumed people would use a variety of methods to get to work (hop on the metrothen take a bus)When I tracked peoplethey would do thisyou build a dam - the water level raises People go to the store People go to work The water gets dirty from pollution I get a sense that the city is a living and breathing entity - it gives me context to the experienceFocused Construction You place roads and zones freelyfocused around the placement of the roads The zones are indelibly linked to this It was a great design decision and simplifies the more annoying aspects of construction It also makes the transport very obvious as one of the key aspects of the game000 peoplebut the listed population is only 30it's almost impossible to make angles of a similar basis repeatedlyat least at the start Over time I might grow to understand this more Also the numbers don't often line up well My metro station might say ""100 per week"" but in the overall transport graph only 20 people are said to be using the metrobuy this game Not since SimCity 4 Rush Hour have I enjoyed an experience this much I find it hard to suggest major ways to improve the concept I strongly dislike casual approaches to the genreand this is not one of those Yet I also think it makes the genre more accessibleImagine being EA and screwing up SimCity so muchthat someone in Finland got fed up and made a better gameIn 2013after 10 years of waitingthe Sim City community of moddersfansand aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City Ten years is a long time to wait for a gamebut people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title Long story shortit was a massive dissapointment Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRMAlways On APMtiny mapsforced origin installationlacking mod supportno steam supportand a forced multiplayer aspect  I decided to not purchase the titleso it may have been a decent gamebut 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossibleand gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game  And for that Maxis is now out of business They will never make another gameand it is no one's fault but theirsand here it is people: Sim City 5but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time  The game runs so smoothly with so much going onit really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near itthere are dynamic shadowszoning is backand it is not 'dumbed down'  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim Cityand you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand  The map editor is awesomethe community is thrivingthere are mods to do anything you wantand this is the city building game we've all been waiting for  I can not possibly reccomend this moreThis really is the greatest city simulator there isand will be for quite a long time I'm having trouble finding ANYthing wrong with this game I've played most SimCity'sAnno 2070Cities XL and almost fell for the Cities XXL nonsense Then I found this gameand my life is completeit doesn't have that featureless feeling some of the plainer UI's havehowever you do need a good processor and a few GB of RAM to play it idealyno glitches or anything There's even a little in-engine physics to things like carsrivers and treesunlike 2013's SimcityCopper Creek on the workshop is my favoriteit's not really a big deal) are things like garbage and deathcare They tend to get overwhelming and lots of weekly money needs to be spent to fix them (When your landfills are full or more people are dying than you can transport to a cemetary kind of thing) I'd recommend finding something better on the workshop or using the asset editor to lower/raise some gampleay values in those buildings slightlyyour citizens in this game are bornageand die eventually Don't worry thoughthey'll be replaced by their children for the largest part But there may be a point in the game where a lot of people suddenly die and it's a little scary This is because of your senior citizens getting a little too old if you know what I mean Be sure to prepare for this if you find it to happenI am not completely certtain if it's just that playrhrough of mine of if it's actually a phenomenon within the game   :Pthis game really is a worthwhile investment and it honestlycoming from someone who's a dear city-builder fansteps on all the other titles and I mean ALL of them You'll love itFor 2 weeks I debated purchasing [i][b]Cities: Skylines[/b][/i] (I'm sure I annoyed most of my friends by weighing the pros and cons with them!)

the SimCity successor  Cities: Skylines is what SimCity 2013 should be  Although the graphic is nice and the city scaling up through playingthe performance is still good and not laggy at all  Cities:

Yesits been that long since a really decent sim has been released Upon learning that one of my favorite publishersParadox Interactivehad a City Building simulation in the works I knew this was a game I could not wait to get my hands on Paradox Interactive is known for being a leader in challenging and entertaining  strategic games so I felt if anybody could do it rightthey could Having been able to test the game for almost a full week before its official release I can say that my trust was not misplaced Cities Skylines is everything I hoped it would be This is city building done rightCities Skylines is far and abovethe best city building simulation ever made Period Colossal Order has come up with a recipe that ingenuously combines just the right amount of simplistic game design with a flavorful amount of challenging gameplay to create a masterpiece Fans of City Building simulations will definitely not want to miss grabbing this gamebut more about true city management Do things right and your populus will be greatful and steadily grow Do things poorly and your city will clear out faster than a zombie apocalypse could make it happen Numerous tools are at your disposal as expected with an interesting dynamic that truly brings the realism into the game Cities can be carved up into different districts and each district can have its own set of policies and characteristics Players even choose the names But it doesn't just stop there Players can give custom names to just about everything in the game including its citizensColossal Order has easily found a way to challenge players along these lines Cars and trainsships and planes Cities Skylines has it all The water simulation is spectacular as well Placing your sewage disposal upstreamfor examplecould result in contaminating your citizens' water supply Realistic flooding is another possible scenario The maps included are gigantic and beautifully designed terrains that offer endless possibilites when planning your city and continued population growth unlocks the ability to expand to adjacent tiles on the map as well as making more buildings and options available (such as taking out loans) These options are tied in with overall success and not just simply from having enough funds availablea feature which definitely enhances the experienceperhaps one of this game's best features is the inclusion of asset and map editting tools to allow the Steam Community to heavily mod this game in order to continue its growth and stability in the future while adding tons of extra content and replay valueabout the only area I found lacking in this game is not having a variety of random events such as natural disasters I cannot say with certainty why the developers chose not to include them and perhaps they will be added later as DLC since most Paradox Interactive games are known to offer quality additional content long after initial releases The modding community could possibly offer them as wellsince I predict the Steam Workshop will quickly fill up with a large variety of added content Firesfloodspollutioninfrastructure and transportation issues are still more than enough to keep players challenged and fully engaged thoughso overall its not really a major concernbe sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunitycom/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url][/i]This is a truncated version of this video review:or simply want to try one for the first timeI donâ€™t hesitate at all in saying Cities Skylines is a superb choiceI was chomping at the bit to get my hands on this thing Iâ€™ve spent about 40 hours on it so farso the question is: does it succeed in its goal of topping SimCity? Wellin a wordYESyou start with a blank plot of land and a set of tools at your disposal Generally the goal is to build a citygrow it as big as you likeand make sure it doesnâ€™t die You have a single highway connection to start out withwhich acts as the first of many entrances to your city Use the road tools to draw some roadsand youâ€™ll see that you get groups of tiles extending from the side of them These tiles can be filled with three types of zones: residentialcommercialand industrialwhich will become homesshopsand factories Although more come into play later onlike high-density residential and commercial zonesas well as office zonesthe central system of RCI demand is very much in play here The more demand for a zone you havethe more people will move in to fill those zones and the more service buildings you'll requireso youâ€™ll want to balance their placement with the other needs of the city Beyond these basicsitâ€™s totally up to you as to whatâ€™s nextbut once you start reaching its bordersyou have the option to buy moreup to 36 square miles worth (more if you mod the game with the excellent tile mod on Steam) Althoughsometimes the game gets a bit bogged down in ambiguities regarding its logicmostly regarding trafficservicesand lack of UI information But once I started to figure these systems outthe challenge in fixing them was hugely rewarding Cities XXL and SimCity 5 were entirely too easyand if you screwed those cities upthat was a real feat of ineptitude Herea doomed city can arise from something as simple as building an intersection instead of a multi-lane traffic circleand thatâ€™s kind of awesome But it doesn't feel cheapit feels like something to learn from and perform better next time There are also some included mods from the developerswhich act as cheats and difficulty settings in lieu of more traditional menu options And on top of that there's an incredible potential for user-made modswith a full blessing from the developer to do so with the included Steam Workshop supportI start seeing zone layouts in my ceilingand traffic patterns in my cereal Just give me a pot of coffee and watch me while away dozens of hours creating the perfect balance of land valuecity servicesand mass transit systems and be completely content Itâ€™s blissfulstressfuland compelling on a level that few games ever achieve for me anymore There are so many details that I lovelike the way you can paint zones with different brushesthe sweeping orchestral soundtrackthe guidelines that appear when placing roadsthe fact you can flood your city if you dam a river improperlythe way any zone has buildings that fit into any plot shapeand on and oneven when surpassing 100000 citizensit still played solidly with minimal frame rate issues on both my desktop and laptop Colossal Order pulled off a true colossal order here: they made a better SimCity than Maxis could (requiescat in pace) And all this with a comparatively small budgeta team of a dozen or so peopleand the Unity Engine Just wow Cities Skylines is a total slap in the face to SimCity 5and man is it a beautiful thing to behold And the price you get twice the game at half the price of its rival's launch price Folksthis is what I like to call â€œdoing it rightâ€ They couldâ€™ve charged double and I still would recommend itbut wow This is a top-notch game at a bargain launch priceand it makes me want to cry tears of joyLet me give you a history lessonand it was alsogreat  (Are you seeing a theme here?)SimCity 4 was releasedand it was perfectionwhich was a thing12 years after the last great city building game comes SkylinesCollossal Order has hit one out of the park  Runs great on older machineslooks greatand has GREAT mod supportwhile writing the

minimum)Cities: Skylines is a City Builder/Simulation gameand itâ€™s fantasticSim Cityin every conceivable way  Where Maxis managed to somehow fail in a genre they pretty much inventedColossal Games and Paradox Interactive have treated Maxisâ€™ effort as a treatise on what not to dowithout a doubtthe game Sim City 2013 should have beenthe graphics Skylines is very well optimizedwith large detailed cities bustling along with no hiccupsand some nice options in the settings to fiddle with if you do experience any problems The game looks greatwith lots of detail Buildings grow and â€œlevel

You initially start on each map with a 2 square kilometre parcel of land in which to buildbut can expand out over 8 such parcels out of 25 available per map That saidit is trivial to mod out the limitationand if your computer can handle ityou absolutely can build on the entire map As a bonusif you donâ€™t like any of the premade maps the game ships withyou can easily use the in-game map editor to create (or recreate!) your own map to play on There is even an asset editor tooso you can create and modify the in game assets to your preferencesand work how youâ€™d expect them to This is a simulation gameafter all! After youâ€™ve finished zoning your cityyou can then create districtswhich allow you to apply policies city wide or just to select areas Make the CBD have compulsory smoke detectors and free public transportwhile giving the poor and destitute section of town a rebate on green energy Ban heavy vehicles from residential areas to lower noise and decongest traffic!but require careful planning Take advantage of natural oil reservesmine orefarmcut down your forests or simply go for â€œGenericâ€where youâ€™ll be making random stuff The finance and taxation system is easily understood and superbyouâ€™re given plenty of optionssuch as numerous road typespublic transportcargo shipstrains and aeroplanesthe game has an incredibly effective water simulation too; Dams will burst and water flows realistically throughout the mapand pollution will be carried downstream with currentswith integrated Steam Workshop support People have already uploaded thousands of custom maps and assets to the workshopas well as gameplay tweaks and itâ€™s pretty safe to say that if you find something wrong with the game that you think could be betterthere is a very good chance that there is already a mod for it on the workshopwhat are the cons?there is a mod for thatwhich would have been nice Butthere is a mod for thatthere is a mod for that There is another one that enables a First Person View from and person you click on in the street!the workshop has hundreds availabledownloaded and added to the available maps with a single clickusing the in game people as avatars Why? Who knows! But itâ€™s possible!if you like city builders or simulation gamesyou cannot go wrong with Cities: Skylines It is everything you could want out of this genreeat your heart outWithout a doubt one of the best City Builders of all time The price is so reasonable for the amount of quality content you get both from the default game and from all the modders on the Steam workshop I'm so looking forward to what new things will be released in the future for this game The Developers also listen to their customers and have been adding more modding tools for us to use to create new assets for players Thanks CO!So I made my first citygetting it from zero to eight thousand when I finally unlocked dams At this point I was doing terrible with electricitybecause I really didn't want to make many coal plantsso the second I saw Dams unlocked I saved to make one I found a great spot that could solve my energy needs foreverand placed the dam As I clicked I knew I made a terrible mistake I made the dam directly beside the densest part of my Residential District Water poured over the side of the dam and into the citydrowning my population and creating abandoned buildings When the water finally calmed down it was in the form of a lake in the center of the cityhalfway in residentialhalfway in commercial In an attempt to fix this I started pumping the water out (which actually seems to have worked)but I put the output in a place where it flowed into both of my main water pumps And while I was only pumping plain water out of my citythe game counted it as waste water I was feeding my citizens fresh water poop So while water was killing the center of my citypoop water was killing the rest The surge of water also managed to destroy my garbage collectionso I got this terrible mix of overflowing riversoverflowing garbageand overflowing sickness- Modding from day oneexcept for Steam)but don't worrythe genre is in safe hands Colossal Order's hands1 Build a roadLet's start with this: it is an amazing city building game It's the best in generations BUTlike any other gameit has it's downfalls toobut you can expand to a total of 9 of themfor a 18x18km area or 324 km or 201 mi area Another pluside is that there are already mods to expand your city size to a total of 25 tilesfor a 50x50 km area2500 kmor 1553 mi area The size of this doesn't make your computer lageitherunless you don't meet the minimum requirements for the gameand you can explore the lives of each of them The only problem is the traffic It's terrible: If there all 6 lanes availablethey will all go in one lane Geniuswatch this video: https://wwwyoutubecom/watch?v=wVoP1Um95Sg&list=UUZYqx1ak0C-YKhUQY6QtxDQfrom perfecting neighborhoods to fixing water pipes The only reason I knocked 1 point off is because there are no disasterswhich in my opinion is something required for a city building gameyou can model your own buildings :)but it is still great It has it's own stylewhen your in a city trying to buildpop ups everywhere makes it hard to workit is very cheap at the time of it's releaseFinallythe city builder everyone was expectingand still wantedthe workshop for this game is bat shit crazythe rest of the game is more than enough and then someand an EA park in which homeless vagrants can do what homeless vagrants doand how you're paid in return - by asking what it wants and listening to what it asks for Not telling it what it needs insteadEAThings I can do in Cities: Skylines that I couldn't do in SimCity (5)I received it for free with another game I had purchased I must admit it was one of the weakest SimCity games I had played but I still put some time into it because I appreciated that the Maxis team had tried something differentI would rather play a game made in 1994 than one made in 2013 And when SimCity came out with an expansion pack for it a few months after releaseI was done Done with SimCity A game that I have played and loved my entire life The first PC game I owned other than solitaire and that crazy pinball game that came with Microsoft =="

  so my char ""Lupo LaRaza"" is now named whispersxx Stupid crap   NE WAY if that is my only complaint i have to give RDR2 a big THUMB upthe only crime Arthur is guilty ofis stealing my heartFOR PEOPLE BEING TOLD TO RE-PURCHASE THE GAME!!!allow me  Go to Steam settings >>>Downloads>>>Clear download cacheand try to launch the game  this worked for meHope it works for youThere are storiesgood storiesand then there are those stories you'll remember for a long time This game has it all Adventuretons of things to doa marvelous storyfun gameplayand most of all it leaves you something You really care for the charactersthe gang ""family"" becomes like your familyand when things go bad you really want to help Of course in the meantime you can huntrobkill and do whatever nasty or good thing you preferbut you know someone is waiting for you And the ending will bring tears to your eyes for different things in multiple occasions Add to this an incrediblevery realistic environmenta perfect western setting that would make Sergio Leone proud and you have an absolute masterpiece Oh i really wish Red Dead Redemption 1 were on Steam too maybe with some patience Just go and get itThis review is for the single playerspent 150 hours to reach 91% completion and would need maybe 50 or 100 more hours to 100% it I didn't try the online yeti'll add the review for that after i try itbut it's a long game with some excellent missionsas usual when it come to Rockstar games and the humor is spot oncharacters are great and the story as a whole is a great prequel to the excellent Red Dead Redemptionnothing hard if you want to jump from one mission to anotherbut it'll take you a bit of time to get familiar with all the activities that you can doespecially the hunting which is essential if you want to craft the best items in the gameeven while not at the ultra settingsthis game is insanely beautifuli never felt a world full with life as much as in RDR2Rockstar went into each detail to create the last days of the Wild West and it's a huge payoff for the playersyou really feel like you riding with a gang in the early 1900s And with photo modewhatever you are doing and wherever you are on the mapbe sure that you'll end up with a nice photo I'll add to that the dynamic weather and different environment that wont change just the looks but also the fauna and flora of the regionfrom food to ammo to tonicsalso loved the weapon modificationsto make each weapon customized to a different lookyou can fast travel easily using camptrain or stagecoachbut i dont advise thatyou'll miss a lot of nice things like thata lot of random events Plus there is way too many things to collect that will take hours and hours to find them alladd to that around 100 challenges and you have over 200 hours of gameplay without even touching the online part of the game and even with all that time i'm sure that you'll miss a few of easter eggs or interesting places in this gameso it's highly recommended for anyone who have the patience to learn what this game have to offereach 5 or 10 minutes i receive this error:the balls on your horse shrink in the winterThis game is more detailed than my lifeI'm 50long time gamerfirst time a ""game"" has been emotional for me It is just an epic experience to play I have had issues with crashingsound problems(reboot fix)annoying cursor showing(switch to windowed and then back to full)so it has been frustrating at times but generally runs pretty well and looks beautiful @1440p mostly ultra on Ryzen 3600 & RTX2060sadlybefore I play its ilke againWhat can I say that hasn't been said and that you don't knowthe missionsfrom the smallest to all the main missions are worthy of oscarsit felt so real to methat I would spend hours living and breathing the gameI felt I was thereat that timespending time fishing and huntingsometimes for hoursand heavy raincollecting every piece of clothing and trying to look dashing at all timestook care of themor dragged them behind my horse when I wasn't in the mood for their BSI was a cowboy Nobody will convince me otherwiseThis game teach us something very important: Its never too late to be a good personand you can always seek for redemption Its perfect in every single wayone of the best for sure I love you Arthur Morgan!Obviously this game has been given countless amazing reviewsall I have to add is thatI haven't seen one anywhere near this class since Fallout: New VegasThis game is not for everyone It is most definitely NOT Grand Theft Auto with horses It's slow-paced and immersivea reality you live in rather than a game you playyou don't It's much slowertooget it! It's incredible!Rockstar Games is known for setting benchmarks when it comes to their open world titles Red Dead Redemption 2 is their best work to datewithout a doubt Unquestionably beautifulvast and detailed It breathes life From the tiniest toad to the scary Grizzly beareverything feels alive and convincing It's an environment so well crafted that it makes you wonder whether it isn't a real world within your own computer Non-playable characters have their own liveswith a routine that they follow religiously just like we do Some do hard worksome drink all daysome mourn their loss(es) It's hard to believe it's just a video game I remember when Skyrim had something similar and people couldn't believe how insanely realistic it was Imagine thatbut twice as convincing That's RDR 2 for you They feel so alive that you feel bad for killing them with your plethora of period-accurate weaponrya game is not solely made of environment and their inherent goodies That's where the story mode comes in Andas many of you may know by noweither from YouTube or any of the media portals you routinely visit for the daily dose of gaming newsit's a masterpiece Storytelling is not an easy craftbut they have visibly dominated it after decades and decades of duly delivered benchmarks of how an open world game should be They make it seem easyalmost as if anyone could do it Memorable charactersinsane character development just like we like it and then fantastic endings based on your own decisions As linear as it may beforcing you to do things their way rather than setting your imagination free and letting you decide how to approach a missionit still allows you to take certain decisions that will shape the moral values of your charactertherefore leading it to a specific outcome Games don't often get the whole moral debate rightunderstandably sobecause they are empty characters with a pre-recorded set of phrases and reactions that can't resonate with you But Arthur Morgan is different It's a rather captivating individualthat feels real Real enough that you will often find yourself questioning whether to kill or spare someoneor if you should or not help that person in need And inevitably feel the pain of uncertainty of the future - or the lack thereof - that lies aheadand watch your character grow through all the hardships of the outlaw life A novel-like main character that is a criminalkillercruel and savage but also a human being like all of us And humanity winsin the end Arthur learns what it is to be humanand there is no better teacher than life itselfthe typical Rockstar linearity and the underwhelming online modethe story is something out of this world It truly outstands Goes above and beyond the average video game storytelling It's something you've got to experience to understand A must-play for every gamer out thereIt was not a gameit was an experience"
1,"A rather complex grand strategy gameyou pick a country to control starting from the year 1444 all the way to 1821 There isn't any fixed objective to aim for: it's  a good idea to try to get the achievements offered (such as world domination)as most are a real challenge to earnallowing movement of you armies from one to another in real time - nothing here is turn based Battles aren't controlled by youas in total war: you make your army walk onto the same province as an opposing armyand the battle outcome is decided in part by random dice rollsand in part by factors you can influencesuch as generalsterrainmorale of troops The same can be said for naval battleswhere different types of ships behave differently depending on what sea province you are fighting inif they are in the open oceanor in a closed sea (such as the Mediterranean)countries can have a number of different governmentssuch as feudal monarchies or merchant republicsall that give different bonuses and malusesand some (such as republics) offer the possibility to choose what type of leader you wantso as to give you more of a certain type of monarch points You can offer alliancesroyal marriagessupport rebelscreate false claims on provinces you don't own to give you a ""casus belli"" (a reason to go to war) among other thingsthe list is really really hugeyou have 3 different types of monarch points (AdministrativeDiplomaticMilitary)each that serve different purposes For examplemilitary points can be spent to buy a new generalor to treat a province harshly if rebels are likely to rise up there (As of the Art of War updaterebel mechanics have changes slightly Instead of each province possibly spawning rebels depending on a percentagenow each rebel faction has a counter that goes up or down depending on your country's stability and province modifierssuch as nationalismculture or religion Once the counter reaches 100%multiple stacks of rebels spawn) Other points can be used to change your capitalannex vassalsgain provinces in peace dealscreate buildings and much more The gain of monarch points depend on your rulerthat can give from 0 points each to 6 point each month By spending some of your incomeyou can also hire advisorsthat can add to your monthly monarch points incomeand grant you some nationwide bonusesyou have merchants and you can choose to send them to various trade nodesand you can choose if you want them to try and collect money from that node with a malusor to send the money that you collect upstreamto a different node where you can collect from Having colonies and trade agreements with other countries helps your trade incomewhile being embargoed reduces your trade in nodes that the country embargoing you controlsgiven out for free Now fortresses are placed in various provinces in your country (you can also choose to build them once you have the money)and they exert a ""zone of control"" Provinces without forts on them are very easy to conquer while in warwhile provinces with fortresses on them have to be seiged or assaulted to fall under the attackers control Forts now block enemy units from advancingallowing the defending nation to have some space to reorganize and prepare defenceswhile the attacking nation has to carefully choose how and where to attack so as to lose the least amount of troops Unoccupied forts also have a ""zone of control"": If you conquer a province next to a fortbut leave the fort to itselfthe fort will free any occupied neighbouring province while at war I love these changesespecially if you play a large nationas it adds a whole extra layer of strategy to how you build up you nation's provincesbut with each DLC comes a vast amount of free content as wellso it might be advisable to buy the base game before buying DLCso as to see what you think about the game before commiting too much If you choose to play online with a friend that owns the DLCseven without owining the DLCs yourselfthe game activates themso its possible to try them out before you buy It would also be a good idea to try and watch a tutorial beforehand (Arumba on youtube comes to mind)as the game doesn't do a great job of explaining all it has to offerand occasionaly frustrating gamebut I found that the more I played itthe more I enjoyed it: I'm constantly learning new things I can use to my adantageand the game is becoming more satisfying due to thatAfter playing Civilization 5 for quite a long timeI have started to become interested in a deeper gameplay with deeper political consequencesbetter religionsand more interesting colonize mechanics I couldn't do in Civilization Of course there are plenty of mods to extend the gameplay for Civilizationbut a new gamewhere everything is newis fresh and excitingbut the music dynamically changes when going to war with another countrywhich is trying to boost the morale of the playerwhich usually works The weird part about the peaceful songs arethat they are somewhat forgettablebut will stick to your head so that you may find yourself whistling a tune of a melody a week laterfor 2â‚¬ each so you are not missing out on too much The ones which are more expensive have definitely more going on For example the ""new"" DLC ""Conquest of Paradise"" enhances the colonization mechanics which wereat the beginning of the gamea bit lacklusterbut more on that laterthe interesting part about them isthat you are absolutely free to choose which date you are going to startthat means you can play against revolutionary French as Austria or play as Portugal to colonize the new worldthere are militaristicdiplomaticpassive and colonizing leaders for each country with their accurate ruler of that time That isuntil you start playing and the heirs will be completely different than actual history of course The human player gets treated just like an AI to other AI'sif you conquer they will hate youif you don't have any alliances they are going to attack youthat's why there's that certain point of risk of alliances with the AIwhich can make your AI ally to an enemy faster than you might think Just never trust them too muchthere are currently 71 unique idea groups for specific countryâ€™s18 group ideas for country regions (like Italy) and 8 possible slots for your own idea groups to choose which consist of another 7 ideas That sounds like a lotand it certainly was a pain for the creatorsbut it was well worth it It gives most of the countries just their own specialty But I'm not going to go into that sort of stuffColonize more than 5 provinces in a certain region and a colonial vassal gets created The colonial vassal is just like another countrybut he has to pay taxes and can't attack you You can control these taxes on your ownbut never set these taxations too highbecause you know what happened with the USA and Great Britain at that time Independence wars definitely can get a strain on youif you know that you have to travel across the Atlantic Ocean to fight a warbut I just want to bore the casuals and try to keep the strategic fans interestedespecially the fighting mechanics and monarch pointsbut I don't want to tell you everything There is that certain interest I wanted to awake in some peopleso that they are going to try this game for themselvesand not get ultimately bored because I just told them everything of the game40â‚¬ certainly is quite a lot in the steam shopbut that's why special sales exist If it's getting 50% off I can definitely recommend itand hasn't even bored me a bit so faror try it and hate itand if you are still reading thisthanks for reading my first proper review It means quite a lot to meLet's start off with the assumption that you've never played a grand strategy game before You've

1,"Rejoice: Youve lived long enough to see Halo 3 on PC.I was never able to play this on console do to my disability but with the MC collection on steam I can enjoy every minute of all the campaigns i never got to playHalo never diedit was just missing in action.They brought Halo 3 to pc. Enough to make a grown man cry700/700 Achievements. Never doing that again. Just play the gameok.The only thing missing are my friends whove been afk for 8+ yearsIts 2010. Me and the boys launch Halo Reach for the first time ever as we put Halo 3 back in its case. We play invasion and then jump onto forge world. Forward to 2011 me and the boys are high ranks. Dominating any game we enter together. We then establish a large group of players to play custom games with. We played a lot of just Fat Kid lol. But then the game mode infection came out. And me and the boys suited up and played that game mode for 2 years straight. Its 2013. Most of the boys go silent. Few play Halo Reach. Some jump on to Halo 4but it isnt the same. Slowly but surely me and including the boys go silent.[b][u] TL;DR[/u] [/b] Finally finish the fight on PC after 13 years of waiting.the level design can sometimes become repetitive. Especially on the library mission. The remastered visuals look nice but I find that it deviates way too much from the original vision of Bungie. You can switch between the old and new graphics with a press of a button.Id give this game a [b][i] Wort Wort Wort out of 10 with a slight slight tinge of heresy. [/i][/b]Halo ODST takes place during the events of Halo 2 and follows a squad of Orbital Drop Shock Troppers that get deployed to New Mombasa. It uses the same engine as Halo 3 and so the fidelity isnt much a leap from Halo 3 but the art style is drastically different and takes on a noir style with washed out colors. Kinda reminds me a little bit of Deus ex Human Revolution tbh. Even more so because of its semi open world/hub design.this game was the first to release for the MCC on PC and quite frankly the port was not very good. It had audio issuesvisual degrades when increasing resolution and many more problems. However343 have already corrected many of these issues and now it is a great port to PC. Reach takes place before the events of Halo Combat Evolved and is a prequel to the entire series. It puts you into the shoes of Noble Sixa member of Noble Team that are tasked to... well I wont spoil everything here. Just know that youre stepping into some shoes the rest of the squad would rather leave unfilled.the mantle was given to 343 industies by Microsoft to carry on the legacy of Halo. The very first game by 343i came as Halo 4 and would be a direct sequel to the conclusion of the Halo trilogy in Halo 3.the change in art stylelevel design and gameplay loop. I will just call this change ""different"".Firefight and Spartan Ops: [/h1]finding matches has not been a problem.Big Team BattleCapture the flag and such; but there are also interesting and odd game types which are a good change of pace.there is a battlepass system in place where you can unlock various cosmetics such as armor partsgun skins and vehicle skins for each game.the system is completely free and you dont miss out on previous seasons as they are all accessible indefinitely.which is a great decision on their part.then Halo Reach and Halo 3 ODST have a mode called firefight where you have to fend off wave after wave of enemies with changing modifiers or mutations.a game mode exclusive to Halo 4. It is a cooperative campaign(you can solo) where you get to use your customised spartan from multiplayer. Keep in mind that although there is a set narrative herethe quality of production in spartan ops is nowhere near the level as that of the main Halo 4 campaign.firefight and spartan ops are solid addictions to the already superb collection of 6 campaigns. The only thing missing right now is a custom server browser which I believe is in the works.Halo: Combat EvolvedHalo 2 and Halo 3! :DHalo 3Halo Reach and Halo 4.Halo MCC allows you to open the game in anti cheat free modewhere you can install and play community created mods.mod tools for Halo: Combat EvolvedHalo 2 and Halo 3 have been added.you must be thinking to yourself why did you read all of that.why did I write all of this?There are those who said this day would never come. What are they to say now?Its Halo but on your computerI knowiam late ..than never"" right??Ive been dreaming of having an xbox..you know ""finishing the fight..""that dream never come truesince i can make my own moneyHALO 4 coming..I remember when I was young I really wanted to play Halo 3 and Reach so much but I didnt have an Xbox 360... that was over a decade ago now and both these games have launched on PC here on MCC.Reach has been good to me.WARNING! In order to download all of the games in the collection DO NOT use the in game menu to do so. It constantly fails and only downloads maybe one thing you selected. To download everything you wantjust go into the properties in your steam libraryclick on DLCand then select what you want. This is the only frustration free way of doing it!all my friends are so much betterbut that doesnt stop my love for the series. I remember the days of oldOG Xboxsleeping over at my best friends house every weekend to beat Halo 1 CO-OP. Then Halo 2 came outand we would beat Halo 1 then 2 CO-OP over night. Then Xbox 360 came out with Halo 3. So then we played Halo 12 and 3 CO-OP. Sadly I have to move away before ODST came outbut by then the 360 was out of courseand we could play Xbox Live with voice chat. The new coming era of online gaming kept me and my best friend playing halo together for years to comeeven with an entire country now between us. This is the beautiful story that so many of us share with Halo. Friendships and Needlers.and now playing it on a pretty beefy PC in 1440pit looks amazing! Just how your brain tries to think you remembered itwithout any polygons. But of course you can press a button and bring it back and forth to see how it really lookedvs how your mind painted it in modern graphics for you.Got called the ""N word"" on Halo 3 the other day. War never changesI am sincerely sympathetic for any living being who did not grow up with this game.even if youre a campaign only boy like methis is still some amazing value.It was only a dream to imagine Halo coming back to PC and now it has come true. The Master Chief Collection definitely succeeds but is still a tiny bit rough around the edges in some aspects. No major issues in my experience such as crashes or start-up problems. My biggest gripe is that you cannot crouch while moving which feels very off. The framerate appears greathowever100+ FPS here doesnt feel as quite as smooth as 100+ in other games. Havent quite figured out as to why that isor if its just mebut my eyes adjusted anyway. I remember putting in many hours into Halo: Custom Edition (Combat Evolved) years ago so Ive been looking forward to this.I have been a big fan of the Halo series since CE so I may be a bit biased but yea.honestly dont wouldnt even wait for it to go on salenot really regularyou need to play 4 million mp matches just toor slowly go up depending on what level you areeven if its over commsWell... its halo"
1,"Give PC next gen? PC is beyond the specs of PS5 and the new Xbox.. don't see why we don't have the next gen experience??????????2ki don't understandnor does the entire PC community who decides to waste their hard earned money on this game. It is to no surprise that the PC community has the best specs. So that begs the questionwhy isn't NBA2k22 on PC running at the ""nextgen"" version? It makes zero sense. Zero. It is an absolute disgrace and insult to the entire fan base that you guys surprisingly still have on PC.PC players want nextgen. We not only want thatbut we want to be treated like you guys actually care about all of us who play your game. I feel let down. And you all should feel let down too for allowing your PC players to be stepped on like this. Do betterget better.Welp. This is it. Been a die hard fan since 2k13 and im honestly done. So fed up. I honestly can't convey my frustrations. No next gen on pc? Ok i understand that..maybe they had a deal or something with microsoft/sony.......but to play this piece of recycled garbage they call a new game...blasphemous..Im disgusted and if there was a way to get my money back i would. Quit focusing on your stupid fucking cosmetics and in game clothes u dumb fucklers. Focus on the actual gameplay not if u have the new lowtop Travis Scott jordans WHAT THE FUCKDO NOT BUY THIS!this isn't a ""ooh let's boycot 2k till they fix the game"" type of thing. There are genuine reasons why you shouldn't buy this game.this is a carbon copy of it.while the next gen have a completely different badge system. We get the same labelssurebut the way you get them? 100% different.in nextgen it's a whole different game.and 2k21.so even this don't really count).but the same old system.and not 2k21.and you wanna get it or whatevergo ahead. But I 100% recommend you either get 2k21 on a discount if you gonna play that singleplayeror just get the game on consoles.go ahead.Steam players should have the next gen console version of the nba2k22 this is bs.I bought NBA 2K22 75th Anniversary Edition which gave me 105000 VC. I created a MyPlayer and started MyCareer and after doing so I went straight to progression and spent the VC on attributes which then increased my overall from a 60 to an 80. Next I went to neighborhood and was just wondering around and trying to explore and I came across this door which happened to be the elevator. I noticed that it led to different rooms so i decided to join the 2v2/3v3 room but in the midst of me trying to join it gave me an error message or something like that and sent me to the main screen. I didn't make a big deal of it because I know the game is new and still needs more work done to it. SoI enter MyCareer again only to find out that it didn't save automaticallymy MyPlayer was back at a 60 overalland I didn't have my VC.how the fuck is a PC the ""old generation""Current gen a LGive us next gen!dont waste your money on VC!I played it for 10 mins and wanted to kill myself.The game is pretty simular to the last 2 copies of it.  It is definetly better than 2k21 (thank god lol) but stillI can't see this as actual progress. PC not being recognised as next gen is killing the community and I honestly can't be anything more or less than sad. It's just sad. It's difficult but it's coming out of a big 2K fandon't buy this game.THEY NEED TO RESPECT PC GAMING AND MAKE THE GAME NEXT GEN2K is just the worst company they don't care about their game or community.We want nextgen!I didn't realize that the PC version of the game is considered ""current/last gen"" by 2k and thus has multiple features stripedoften for seemingly arbitrary reasons.2k20 version 3money vacuum pay to win scam pc is ""current gen"" apparentlySo you buy a beast of a PC and see new NBA game being released. You hear about it all being next generationmind blowing thing. Basically Cyberpunk 2077 for sportsbased on all the hype around it. You are absolutely wrongmy friend. This game was done ONLY for nextgen consoles. This isn't even a new game for PC. Comparing it to Cyberpunk 2077 like I diddoesn't do it justicebecause I enjoyed Cyberpunk on PC. Yes it had bugsbut it was a beautiful game.let's just say that ALT+F4 will become a close friend of yours before you pass that first college game test. Rest of the games are easy thereafterwhich makes perfect sensebecause you're going to top 16top8semis and final and it doesn't get more difficult therebut rather counterintuitively  becomes somewhat easier.the game is sooooo much 2k21 that your mycareer character is sometimes [i]still called Junior[/i] ffsas it randomly lags in online 3v3 games with annoying stutterings all around.as you 'upgraded' and going back to 2k21 doesnt make much sense eitherimagine paying 60 dollars for a game that looks like its version from last year which looks like his version from last yearcant be me right?Same game as last year but if I don't buy it they shut the servers off of the last version and previous owners are left in the dark. Not to mention their excuse for keeping lastgen on PC boiled down to""We want to focus on console players even though PCs can handle the graphical upgrade better than nextgen consoles.2k still does not have an ANTICHEAT measures"
1,"The game itself is real good Could be goodthat isif it wasnt literally strangulating you on your very step with LIMITS on every breathwhere you feel like in worst f2p if you dont subscribe to premium accountyou will be ultimately drown in crafting meterialswhich overflow your meager storage chest and overencumber you almost instantlybut there's a LIMIT on cash you can get per day shared between all vendors in gamewhich weights tonsbut useless for you You can sell them for lottery scrips for a (small) chance to win something more usefuland guess what? There is a LIMIT on those scrips you can get per dayso the burden drastically increases every dayif you play at least semi-activelybut at least it increases with your levelingso it's acceptable But You can build a good big housewith an underground personal vault and all you can store there is one aforementioned meager chest Noyou can build tens of different-looking storage chestsbut they all share that same meager storage spacenor there is a point for you to sell anything to another player Everything nice comes via barter only on third-party internet resources Should I mention that cash LIMIT overflows real fast?like on total scrips or gold amountbut those can be managedand not a problem to me at least for nowthere are workarounds to do sobut they are unsafeor require to use help from OTHER PLAYERSIt's weirdbut thenbut thenbut thenbut theninteresting enemies and the board game thingybut thenbut thenbut thenbut thenbut thenI really do But it just doesn't workA few days ago I received an email from Bethesda customer service It said that my Fallout 76 account had been suspended for cheating They pasted in a couple of paragraphs from the code of conduct that said no use of third party cheating software was allowedwhich they only respond to about once a dayIt would not accept my password I clicked on the â€œI forgot my passwordâ€ linkwhich did nothing I was not able to reset my password until the next dayFallout 3Fallout: New VegasFallout 4and now Fallout 76I received an email stating the followingit has been determined that the account did in fact violate our Code of Conduct  We regret to inform you that your appeal for an account ban reversal is denied due to the evidence within our system for Cheating / Exploitation enabled via a third-party program   This account is no longer eligible to participate in Fallout 76 due to the offenses on this accountit has been decided that this account will remain  ineligible to participate in Fallout 76 permanently This decision was not made lightlyand it is finalâ€This is a great game But I'm giving it a negative review for one reason:in which you can buy insanely overpriced cosmetics through micro-transactions (in a $40 gameyeah)and Bethesda have ignored this for more than a year only to offer a monthly subscription allowing you to pay $15 dollars a month [i]for unlimited junk space[/i]that it would crash servers Fallout 1st proves that that was bullsh*tso you always can unload your items if you get overencumbered while exploring) The fact that I could not enjoy the game after 60 hours without Fallout 1st is bad Really bad No game should be like thisI became a big fan of Fallout 4 after my grandson talked me into getting the game I delayed on Fallout 76 for the price to drop and to insure PVP wasn't an issue (not a fan) And I have to say there are a lot of positive things with Fallout 76 I also waited for them to do major updates etc I do enjoy the missionlengthy though they be I'm a slow player (almost 70 years old)  Having to move around servers for camp emplacement is a pain but I understand whysonot too bad Building isn't quite as much as in Fallout 4 though you can do a lot as you choose I do wish combat was more along the Farcry 45 typewhere you had the chance to truly sneak into a camp and remove the baddies But overall if you are a Fallout  fan you should enjoy this game Graphics are goodthey corrected a crashing issuecontinue to add content and changes and supports different styles of play I don't pay extra for 'Fallout 1st' (monthly fee) which gives you some nice benefitsand while I could afford itwell I haven't paid a monthly subscription since my wow days Like most games some of the missions are tedious but there are lots of eventsdailies etc to mix up game play So I do recommend it being an overall Fallout fan Happy gaming allbe kindTo start with I'm a huge Fallout fan and have been from the very beginning I've played all the games and loved them (Including questionable endings) But when Fallout 76 came out it was obvious from the beginning that Bethesda had done something very wrong so I avoided it like the plague[h1]TL;DR at the end[/h1]this is my opinion and you might disagree and probably will But opinions are opinionsif you enjoy Fallout 76kudos to youI love it when people are happy with their time spent on X or Yfar from it HeckI would say it's the worse Fallout experience out there Even after almost 3 yearsit's still kind of a mess Gamebreaking bugs?

It's actually really really good! When you start getting the late game guns it's a whole different experience----and that's also an issue Difficulty in this game is everywhereit's either hard just because or too easy oneshot everything'ish And for some peopleincluding methat's just not engaging after the 12453th time Weapons have durabilitycheckammo management is therecheck While annoying as it isit's Fallout after allthere's always something that's on top of the food chain And that's fine! But if that means some weapons are just not reliable at all *cough* bows *cough* why have them in the first place? Also give love to laser guns![/i]I got that slightest chance I lost legendary armor part of my build and a whole set of PAbelieve in thatit's been an issue for a long time now They'll just ignore your ticket and move onbecause from their perspective you're a liar going out for free stuffsome do and doesn't do anythingcan you guess which one I was?this is just a small thing that probably wont affect you but hear me out As a fellow Vault Dweller Cannibalit's so annoying eating your victims and *puuf* falling through the ground It may not happenbut the chance of dying in the middle of nowhere and having to sprint like crazy for your loot is just annoyingI don't care!Â¨ Then why are you playing an online Fallout game? You might as well go to New Vegas and have one hell of a ride therethe world is just hugeeeeee and also empty NPCs can't carry the emptinessthey'll just stand there and repeat the same two linesand when you finally find somebody it usually goes like:be prepared to struggle too Maybe adding a whole PVP dedicated server would fix itbut Bethesda doesn't care about PVPthey did try with Nuclear Winter the Battle Royale mode but we all know how that turned outCAMPs are amazing! It's crazy what other people can do with such a limited builder and the best interactions with someone will happen on your or their CAMP The community is friendly 90% of the timeso don't be afraid to salute a fellow dweller!I still like this gamebut I cannot defend it at allon the countrary I will give it all the hard love it needs just to be better And that's about itmy main issues with F76there's stuff I didn't talk about like seasonsor the terrible writting or quests in general I also didn't mention the perk systemwhich makes the combat way more enjoyable once you get the hang of a buildis it better now? Yes100% Does that make it a good game? NoIt's mediocre at bestif you have the reference of what a Fallout game has to have then you're probably gonna have lots of  issues with it Newcomers to Fallout in general should be fine but believe me when I say there's a better product out there This game is the worse first impression you're gonna get of the franchiselackluster multiplayer experienceboring gun playdumb difficulty scalingperformance issues and many othersit's not worth the full price tagnot even those Deluxe editions And please don't support Fallout Firstit's a joke (all though it's your moneydon't listen to this crazy girl)What if I told you that the endgame in Fallout 76 requires you to build a team of 4 and scatter about the map looking for 24 time sensitive encrypted key fragments After finding themyou sit down together and decrypt a complicated and specific code that allows you to launch a nuclear missile onto the playable map Feeling accomplishedyour team gets together to assault one of the nuclear missile silos in an attempt to do your first launch You spend a majority of your resources finding ways through this highly classified military facility and fighting off hordes of powerful robots When you finally launch the nukeit temporarily alters the playable map to a much crazier state When you travel therea giant boss appears Already drained of most of your resources from clearing the siloyou fight with all you've got and scrape by to barely defeat the mighty enemy in time You and your buddies claim awesome loot and talk about how you can't wait to do it again in a week or so after you've built up more materialsit's the same code for everyone Soloyou clip through the front door of the missile silowhich causes the game to not trigger any enemiesand immediately launch without fighting anything significant The nuke lands and does nothing to the terrain except change the color of some plants The boss spawns and you fire on itbut some random player with a hacked weapon kills it nearly instantly before you do enough damageso you get no rewards 10 minutes later you launch another nuke only to lag out in ground zero because enemies are endlessly spawning under the ground You eventually kill the boss and get basic items that you could loot practically anywhere else in the worldI feel like this would literally be one of the best games of all time But because almost every experience is bastardizedI cannot recommend this game to anyone I have sunken numerous hours into this game because I play video games 24/7 Please do not let my hours fool you into believing that this game is for you I enjoy parts of Fallout 76don't get me wrongbut I wouldn't expect anyone to overlook the issues I have outlinedA bad wastelander stole the weaponsplansoutfits and ammo that I had in my stash due to a vending machine bug or exploit that is years old I contacted the overseer and items will not be restored Good times! That is allDon't get me wrongthe game has improved since launch and is worth picking up on sale It is fun to play up to a point Once your junk starts limiting your stash you spend way too much time organising your inventorylimiting how much fun you can haveBethesda has a solution: the Fallout 1st subscription The fact that they're selling unlimited junkthe feature that would make everyone's time in the game more enjoyableforces me to give the game a bad review unless they give the scrapbox the everyone They should have better incentives rather than an essential featureI really enjoyed this game until I get to the point when my inventory/stash limit intruded between me and funyou're tied with a limited stash in terms of economy ""balance""for a monthly feethey're ready to forget about this principle and provide you with an unlimited junk stashyou're required to heavily manage your inventory instead of having fun It's a ""freemium"" model in a paid gameyou'll be locked with the same activity as when you were at the beginning (excluding completed quests)just a remake of daily challenges & group exp/stat bonus (while there's still no in-game chat)[h1]Season 3 just startedso you might thinkthat Bethesda had enough time to fix their gameright? In meanwhile they managed to implement paywall similar to what you can find in F2P gamesso that mean game is working like it shouldright? WellNOand I am writing this reviewto warn as many people as possibleso they wont pay for this broken software Amount of positive reviews this game got nowis literaly incomprehensible Especialy when we consider technical side of whole experience and how ugly this game is[/h1]because Bethesda produces computer games and notfor examplesoftware for respiratorswhere what I just said is a reality and everyday lifeespecially when we consider it's 2020 right nowbecause in the end our lives are not in dangeronly mental side of our health is somehow exposedbut in this case solution is simple - just don't buy Fallout 76no matter how big discount isno matter how much Todd Howard is waving at yousmilingtelling you that ""it just works"" and you should try it on your ownyou shouldn'tbecause this whole thing is simply not workingand I started playing it when it was launched on Steam I got baited by positive reviews pretending game is now fixedand it's safe to buy itit's not and never willbecause engine used to make this Fallout is simply too broken and too old to handle multiplayer gameand Bethesda is pretending that they're fixing thembut in reality every single fix is bringing back old bugswhere in endgame you will face bug every two minutes! I could make a very long list of bugs and other problems players facebut it would be just too long and it's hard to guess which bugs are active nowbecause like I said previously - Bethesda mastered bugs rotation in this gameand you run trough early game in 60fpsthen in endgame you will have 30fps with regular stutters It is like thisbecause amount of items you carry and store in stash directly affects your framerateand to be honest I've never seen something that much broken in any other game Fallout 76 in a nutshelland in this case first thing coming to my mindis community this game has People are friendly and very helpfulthey will explain everything you want to knowno matter how long it will take They will craft gear for yougive you materialshelp with questsbuild structures you can't build on your own yetfanaticstrolls and sect-like minority To understand what I am talking aboutyou can just browse Steam forums of Fallout 76 for 5 minutes and you'll see it on your own Why I am mentioning them? I am doing this only because Bethesda is doing nothing about problemthey are allowed to keep offending and attacking people who dared (how dare they?!?!) to criticize Bethesda They'll keep striking on you and reporting your postsand you might end up warned/banned for speaking your opinion in mannered way YesBethesda has their own ""freedom of speech"" standardsand it's very close to what you can face in People's Republic of Chinaand then you can use them to get buffs for your character Great idearight? In theoryyesbut you have to use each item for 40-50 seconds to recieve specific buffso if you want to get all of them you waste 5 (!!!) minutes of your timeand one hour later you have to repeat whole process Everytime you want to craft/repair/build you have to manualy change your perks loadoutwhich takes a lot of your timeand when you're done you have to manualy switch to your main build Bethesda promised to implement perk loadouts system months agobut it's not just about that The thing isthat whole perk system lack any logic and common sensebecause perks should be splitted into two categories - active and passiveand crafting ones should not steal slots When you want to buff yourself using items from your inventoryyou have to scroll trough whole menu to find them one by one Every few quests/eventsyou have to do general cleaning of your inventorybecause game keep throwing useless (and heavy) stuff at you as ""reward"" Every single system this game has is unintuitivefrustrating and not rewardingand every simple thing you want to do takes ages to completebecause you discover new places while hikingdo various questsand simply enjoy it But this phase ends pretty fast when you hit midgamewhere grind begins and you realize how many limits this game has In order to reach endgame you have to grindeveryday How much you can store is limitedhow big you camp can be is also limiteddaily questsdaily currency gaineverything is made in a way to make sure you'll play game everyday to reach your daily capand make just a slight or no progress at all Everything from events on map to daily quests is repetitive and boringwhere player feel hounded and forced to play everyday in order to reach daily limitsand if someone play everydaythat mean there's higher chance he will spend real cash to get additional stuff or to buy premium Fallout 76 preys on basic human instinctsthe desire to show offbeing noticedgeneraly speaking - need to be ""cool"" in other people eyes Everything in this Fallout is built like a wall surrounding all these behaviours and feelings They might tell youthat you don't need all that stuffbut believe meyou want it That's how human brain works Atomic shop is a masterpiece when it comes to psychological manipulationfake feeling of items availability being ""limited"" by timeso you have to buy them before they're gonediscounts lasting for limited timegreat deals for premium owners Atomic shopseasonsgame mechanicsboring daily/weekly challengeseverything this game offers in the end has just one common goal - to make sure you're attached enough to play everydayso at some point you might start thinkingthat it wont be a crime if you spend additional money to make your in-game life easier and more colorfuland there's nothing wrong with that But this is paid gamenot some F2P title for android It's also impostant to mentionthat every new feature (like the newest thing available in game - shelters) is hiding 90% of new content and fun behind a paywall Bethesda is literaly moving border to see how far they can goand how much they can earn before this $ fountain dries upjust think twice before you give them to BethesdaYes Have been playing this game for nearly 3 years and like its predessesorsit is the shortest amount of time I have spent on a game [over such a long period] Fallout 4 was nearly 2600 hours and Fallout 3 was 818 hours [over the course of a year] I find these games a challenge at 60 years of agebut immensly rewarding I recommend this game to anyone of any agedon't let that be a barrier I started with original Atari and N64 computers and the industry has come such a long way over the last 40 yearsGive it at least 100 hours of gameplay to really get the true experience Sureits had a few bugsbut overallhas been good value for money I live in New Zealand Kia Ora2018 - ðŸ‘ŽFallout Worlds is an absolute joke Just give us offline words we can mod like any other bethesda game and stop making us pay for something that would take you 30 seconds to add to the game It's a fucking jokeI've played through most of the game's story nowgotten to level 50gotten to the Officer On Deck quest and well I gave up Entirely And it's because of one reason The fucking stashboxbecause if you like hoarding resources in this game (Like you do in Fallout 4 when base building) then sorry buckaroobut your box will become more full than a hentai character during a fucking gang-bang with three Deathclaws As soon as it got full and I had like 20lbs of screws on me that I couldn't depositbecause for some fucked reason the junk weighs more than it does in Fallout 4I immediately realized what the true purpose of Fallout 1st wasthen sell a solution for it YesI know I am basically beating a dead horse at this point but seriouslywhat the actual fuck Bethesda? Do I look like the kind of fucking person who would want to spend 15Â£ a month just so I can get infinite scrap storage? The scrapbox should be fucking FREE I don't care if you need to fucking kill the Scorchbeast Queen 69420 times or some shit to unlock its blueprintI can entirely saywith all my heartfuck this game I'm done with itif you leave a comment disagreeing with me and saying the game is amazing and your only argument for that is insultsI'm just gonna delete it I don't really like getting notifications from those types of people If you are gonna just disagree with me or say something I got wronggo right ahead Just don't be a dick about itaight?great game now with the update but its BS that anyone has to pay 10+ dollars for storage in a fallout game idc its online its fallout unlimited storage is a given even if it was one time 99 cents that would be ok but a freaking subscription is nuts I will not pay for it and no-one should either just straight predatoryI initially started playing this game during the first BETA sessionand have about 2500 hours logged in total  The game has had its ups and downs in the years since launchand it isn't as outright bad as a lot of reviewers and journalists may lead you to believe  It genuinely has its good moments and has improved significantly since launch  The community is generally very friendly and will often go out of their way to help newer players with resources and adviceas a long-time player I can't say I would recommend it to anyone that hasn't already played it  The countless bugs and design flawsthe ever-increasing layers of monetizationand Bethesda's apparent resistance to genuinely listening to the community and glacial pace of responding to major issues make it difficult for me to give this game a positive review  Bethesda doesn't exactly have the greatest track record with this game eitherbut I won't go into detail about issues that were already fixed in the past such as the inventory steal hack and just focus on the problems I currently have with the gamesuch as the infamous ""damage bug"" where if you deal too much damage with certain weaponsall ranged weapons stop dealing damage until you relog  This happens most often with some of my favorite weapons such as the Tesla Rifle and Plasma Flamerand it happens often enough that I may have to relog multiple times per play session just to fix this issue  Leaving a server means I'll often miss out on legendary items and rewards from events and other in-game activitiesand it becomes infuriating very quickly  This issue is what drove me off from playing the game for the majority of 2020and I'm sad to report that this bug is still happening now after I decided to briefly give it another chance at the time of this reviewyou can only earn up to 1400 vendor caps150 scrip200 gold bullionetc per day  These limits feel very restrictive because it's very easy to stock up on far more loot than these limits allow for you to reasonably spendso you'll end up with massive piles of heavy legendary items and loot that may be difficult to offload in your player vendors unless you're extremely active in the trading community  This can discourage you from even playing the game until your limits reset the next dayso even if you're somehow enjoying your time with the game in spite of all the bugs and odd design decisionsyou'll feel forced to log out to keep all your hard-earned loot from going to waste if you don't want to just dump it on the groundor spend 20 minutes doing tedious inventory management to get your stash box below its maximum capacity?

1,"Has a long way to go. Needs more quest contentmore depthsome fixesadded character interactions and dialogue and alot more.it's a modern warband after all. But it could be much more.This is my first review on steam ever. I felt it was kind of my duty to give my opinion on the game that I have personally been waiting for over 6 yearsas Warband happens to be -if not the- one of my all time favourite games (with around 1100 hours of gamplay - yes I knowstill rookie numbers compared to some other of its fansbut stillthat's a considerable amount of my life's time).I have -as of now- played 63 hours of Bannerlord and another 155 hours of the multiplayer beta of which I had the honor of being a part. I now feel confident enough to talk about why I think that you should get the game yourselfespecially if you loved any of its previous titles.the game is aesthetically a HUGE development from the awkward indie 2010 (that -even then- still felt older) graphicswhich we all grew to love. The animations seem more realisticthe items more detailedthe campaign map is incredible and the scenery (from the snowy forests of Sturgia to the desert wastelands of the Aserai homelandand from the rocky Battanian villages to the great cities of the Empire) is beautiful and at times even -dare I say- majestic. Surethe graphics still don't compare to the other big games of its timeand the character models still look a bit oddbut for a game of a small company like Taleworlds that chooses to focus more on the gameplay and the game's mechanicsyou can at least overlook some of their flaws.in a world where the Calradic Empire still existsalthough in crisisand new and old kingdoms arise in its wake. Some of the factions are the ones that evolved into the ones in Warband (Vlandia is the predecessor to the Swadians and the RhodoksSturgia is a mix between the Vaegirs and the Nordsthe Khuzaits are the khanate before the rise of the Khergitsand the Aserai the previous Sultanate to the Sarranids)while we also have the Battanians (a celtic-like mountain kingdom) and the Calradic Empire (an empire very similar to the medieval Greco-Roman -now known as Byzantine- Empire). Each of these factions is very well made in order to feel unique and different to the otherswith its own architectureclothing style and troopsthat are very close to their historical inspirationsgiving you a nice depiction of some fields of what the actual medieval world looked like (and in some cases how it worked).for Single Playeron a first look you'd say ""That's an enhanced version of Warband"" and you'd may be right for the most partbut the game offers many new features and details that differentiate it from its predecessor. Examples of this are the many convenience optionslike the way you can recruit troops from villages and towns which can be more and better if you have good relations with the village's notables or the fact that you can see the full items' stats and compare them to your own. There are many new featureslike the Clan and its mechanics (basically youyour family and your companions)the fact that you can have children and continue to play as them once your older character finally kicks the bucketthe forging system which allows you to make weapons and choose how they will look on your ownthe new Kingdom Mechanicsthat enhance the experience of serving or ruling a realm with multiple armies and kingdom lawsand the fact that you can now kill nobles that you capturewith whatever consequences that may entail. Other features have been renewedfixing annoying issues that existed in Warband or completely changing the way they worked for the betterlikefor examplethe new massive battles with more thought out AI-planningand the siegesthat now have siege weapons and are not just a mass of angry people cramming a small ladder only to get violently killed by the other mass of angry people that awaits them on the walls.there are now 3 main modeswhich are Skirmish 6v6 (which is like battle and conquest together)Captain 6v6 (which allows every player to command a small band of troops) and Siege (which is the good ol' siege we all know and lovepolished with siege weapons and some new mechanics). There is also a Team Deathmatch mode which is more like a playground to prepare you for the real modes above. Nowthe way the combat works is almost the same as in Warband (with some minor changes like a shield bash movea crouch move and chain attacks) and I feel like it is what we should expecteven though I hear complaints about it being ""clunky"" and ""unreliable"". I personally enjoy it as I did in Warband and I'd say it is highly dependent on skill and experience (I believe it's hard to learn and to masterbut once you doit offers you a very fun and challenging experience).there are still many issues and bugs which make you question the fact that this is a game that was in development for 8 years and that it is priced as much as it is. If you buy it nowmind that you will come across a lot of them. That being saidyou should also keep in mind that this is still Early Acccess and many of them are bound to change. Alsoyou have to AT LEAST give credit to the developers for keeping track with the complaints and the feedback of the playershaving already made 10 updates (during the first 10-11 days since the release!) and continuing strong. Honestlythe way they keep hunting for issues and bugs and the way they listen to negative feedback is all I could ask from a game studio (whichagainis not a major one) andif anythingdeserves my support in this journey of making the game that we all have dreamt and still dream of.the game is a worthy successor to Warband. It offers you a pretty similar experience that Warband did (letting you explore a vast world of different cultures and giving you the freedom to make your own storywhether it is of the journeys of a merchantthe adventures of a warlordthe path of terror left behind by a bandit leaderor the rise of a new ruler) which is exactly what we should all have expected and hoped for. And yeteven as a game that offers content and possibilities the size (and even significantly bigger than the size) of Warbandit still feels like it has not even scratched the surface of what it is capable ofleaving space to be filled in ways that we haven't even immagined by the many and various mods that are bound to follow (and have already started making their entrance) by the ever restless and creative modding community of Mount&Blade. Soif you have waited for this game like I have and still wonder if you should buy it in its current state I'd sayyesjoin this journeybecause even if it's not yet all you have dreamt ofgiven time and support it's going to be. If you are new to Mount&Bladeand think that it is a little overpriced for a game that is not fully completed yetyou can always wait until it comes out of EAbut I would personally recommend that you give it a goand in the end you will be glad you did.With 2192 hours in WarbandI think it's safe to say that I've experienced my fair share of the classic Warband experience that Bannerlord is not only trying to emulate but also build upon. With 15 hours in the gameI'm already of the belief that Taleworlds will not only achieve this endbut surpass it.yes. Some of the bugs are obnoxiousyes. There are portions of content missing that are sorely needed. Not only is this truebut the disappointment surrounding it is understandable. After 8 years of waiting10 for somethis series has cultivated a cult following of dedicated and loving fansmyself very much includedwho want nothing more than to dive head first into the game.the content included in the game is entertaining; compared to Warbandcombat actually feels weightyand adventuring around Calradia has a heightened sense of danger and excitement to it. Side activities such as smithing allow for those interested in roleplay to create deeper stories for their charactersand core mechanics such as trading have been developed and enhanced in this new release to feel far more responsive and rewarding.content will be addedand I am firmly of the faith that the game will continue to evolve and take shape over the coming daysweeks and months. Everyone is well within their rights to leave a negative reviewbut I would encourage people not to damage the game's rating unfairlyas the current release is not indicative of the finished product.and I can't wait to see that vision be fulfilled.Had my entire fortune poached by wandering looteresmost of my men were killedthose who weren't died later of starvation and the only one to make it to a town was me.

Until one daywhen I made a sword that broke the town's economy. Everyone wanted my sword. In merely a dayI'd earned enough to purchase largess too grand for even kings. Then my life - so deprived in years gone by - was filled but still empty. Money begets moneyand violence begets violence. Eventuallywhen I had conquered the world I knew nothing but stillness. My clan was large and thus was my lot.  Eventually life was bleakif a man could have anythingwould he want for nothing? Or did it mean he could not desire anythingas well?it was 3 am and I realized I had work in the morning.ten out of tenwould Bannerlord again.A lord refused to nominate me for a castle after I successfully captured it so I switched sidestracked down his wifeand chopped her head off. 10/10Great game.

It is overmy sons killedmy wife murdered and staring at my 300 hours campaignsatisfied that the next time; i'm going to behead that lord and his entire family the first time we meet. Until next time...Short version: If there was a tentative recommendation buttonI'd be using it. It very much depends on the personbecause while most people praise the gamethere is a serious contingent that have reasons not to.I don't blame you. It doesn't bother me as long as the first game is good in its own rightbut I can agree that we shouldn't have to buy a second game to get what was promised.but there are plenty of bugs I've seen. I tried walking the streets of Baltikhand and had a CTD while loading them in. I repeated the process to verify that the crash was a consistent thing. So stay off the streets of that town and just hit the trade and recruitment screens there. I'm having issues with attribute points not being given to me at every third level like they're supposed to be. I'm sure it'll get fixed but as of this review I haven't seen it happen. Also having a hard time leveling up charm skill despite following the instructions given in the tooltip. Not sure if it's a true bugor if the tooltip isn't telling the whole story. I'll have to wait and see.I adore what this game is doing with the series. We have families now. Not just a marriage for an alliancebut an actual clanwith potential for childrenand a brother built right into the story. We're the head of a clannot just a nobody adventurer making it on their own. It's very Crusader Kings II to meand I'm loving everything I get into.and we can spend that influence to put laws up to vote that have actual impacts on the stability and power balances within our Kingdoms. Being a vassal doesn't just have to mean warringwe can use our built in influence to do politics as well.I love it. If you're on the fence and don't want to spend 40 or 50 dollars on it yetwishlist itwatch the patch notesand see how it looks when it goes on sale for real. For the rest of youI understand the hate and don't blame you. I just don't share itand I recommend anyone with an interest at least keep an eye on it.they've done a lot of bugfixing. They've also done a bit of fleshing out and adding in features. I can definitely say I've already gotten my money's worth from itand I've been YouTubing it as well. It still suffers some problems from the old games so far. The combat gets samey and isn't all that balanced. There seems to be a big tendency toward telling things rather than showing them properand this isn't helped by gameplay and story segregation. Though I could honestly see the gameplay and story segregation being intentional. There IS a main quest chain with a story to itand there's room to interpret that quest as pretty much poking holes in a lot of the flavor text. Againnot sure if intentional and if it is it's not really that smart a move on their partbut it's there if you want to read into it.this is definitely for you. If notkeep watching or look into other games.Great game... who need 1 or 2 years of development. tl;dr: mid game turn into a micromanagment hell.one party50-150 soldiers doing missionssmall battles or bigger fights joining armies. Good graphicsbrutal engagments with 200-1000 units at the same time if your computer can handleplaying as a soldier is a blast.the micromanagement never stops and gets worse overtime. You have to physically move your party to towns to fix their issues. When your lords get captured & escapesthey'll go into a random town until you pick em againthen you'll have to reform the party. Same with caravanes for tradingif they get capturedyou'll have to go in his town and recreate the caravan. You have to partially fill towns with soldiersmanuallyfrom your own soldiers. All the little fun things of the beginning soon become a hassleas you can't delegate. Messengers are not a thing.you can't tell a party member to move to a location or guard a territorythey do whatever they want if they're out of your army / partyso you have to do it yourself. Either you're leading your huge army to fight what is basically an enless war mid gameor you take care of your cities while the rest of your faction fight... with various success. Some commanders are pretty goodother will throw waves of recruits at highly trained arbalists in the open backed with cavalry. Protip: don't be a recruit in an imperial army.it's up to youor the IA if it feel like it. Worstif you let the parties you created roam around (parties = group of 70-200 soldiers under a lord) they can be (temporarily) drafted in other armies of your kingdom... and you'll have to physically move to the armytalk to the leader and pay some reputation to get them back. Of courselarge armies are slow. This leads the the next problemswarms.it's an army disbanded in the middle of my territory. The small parties usually start raiding all villages in the vicinity while being too fast to be catched by a big army. Raided villages impact your town / castle loyalty and gold quite heavily. Sureyou could disband your army and hunt them yourself... but that makes you take a step backand all your parties would reform under another army you can't control. And mansome army commanders are reallyreally stupid. Verdun style charge in the open against walls of archerscavalry in a forest vs pikemensyou name it. I can't count the time i had parties wiped in someone else army. But let's say you managed to capture the lords burning your villages.they magically teleport to their hometownrebuild a fast 80 mens army in the blink of an eye and go back to raiding villages. AI ""cheat"" with recruitsthey will always find soldiers in towneven if they're empty for you. Executions you say?no matter how much of an A-hole he/she isthe whole faction will hate you. He raided dozens of villages and killed hundreds of peasants? Still not good enough. You just can't kill a lord without suffering heavy consequences down the lineand you'll need those lords to be friendly later. Worth to mentioncapturing the leader of a faction won't stop a war.followed by 600 days of complete peace in the entire map (due to a bug apparently)and i'm now back at 300 days of war. Not a single day of peacewhen one war stop another start immediatly. They will just neverever stop fighting. Can't catch a breathcan't leave the front of your lose towns.it's really fun for a while but it need a HUGE QoL update.One of the best War games I've played plus I used Voiceattack for voice commands. I felt like a field general lol wife thought I was nuts.Wait 10 more years for Final Release to truly enjoy this Grand Game!for mewas not so much to play it nowbut to learn to mod itand enjoy it later with some fine Full Conversion Mods. It's an investment in the future really.challenginga bit better than in Warband.refinediscover new partsand explore new unique weapon combinations as you make your own gorgeous weapons. Make some of the bestmost beautiful weapons yourselfand use them to chop chop smash smash! Thanks for that BL!roughunbalanced.or work poorly. Like don't try to get your brother marriedit won't work.

The game points to Location A when in fact you can find them in Location Bsomewhere probably.. near Location A. Or not.which I like a lot.. is beyond OP and completely crazy broken.

Or buy the best gear in game and hundreds of horses.. by trading just 1-2 swords.[/spoilermake very littleand most will not make any money at all. As in: zero.which are now your vassalsthey are a mess. Instead of getting auto-offers from AIClans are hard to geteasy to lose and unfairly destroy relations. This makes Kingdom almost impossible.and since money is not an issue atmit's just silly.they do not auto-recruitbut will get themselves captured and will waste valuable troops.but sometimes are simply turning a siege into a field battleaka.. not much sieging gameplay if you simply break walls. Opening gates from the inside is toughbut when it worksit's silly and OP. I also had a few crashes after sieges.there are just a fewand a ton of copy-pasteso not much interest in sieging the same castle again and again.it's extremely easy to get to around lvl 13-15ishand then.. pfff. XP requirements for companions are simply broken. They will not lvl upnot this century at least. You finish the game and they are still 1-2 lvls away from where they started.that simply splits the game in: either you do itplay a quickermuch simpler and more repetitive gamemake a ton of enemiespotentially ruin your characterruin diplomacybe forced to go down the genocide path.. and bypass any reason to siege or make a Kingdom. Or not do itplay the long game of building good relations with the nobilitybut miss all the murdering funsecretly wish you could do itand cry yourself to sleep every night. And end up in a mess with your Kingdom anyway. The problem here is.. you can easily lamify the game by executing all nobles. And instead of a juicyrewardingemotionally messy and mechanically complex end gameyou just chop chop chop chop chop... THE END.focusbetter framingbetter organisationless cluttermore consistency and polish. Upgrades are hard to figure out at firsta bit oddand the grey shield icons over the Skills that can upgrade are simply not visible enoughthey should be Colorful Bright Glowy Animated [with a color that stands out! Personally I prefer the grid structure of the Warband inventory.entirely uselessand poorly designed autosave.. doesn't async save in the background. It freezes the game for a few seconds. You can't turn it off.depending on how you play and what you may try.it's essential!Wish it had a Co-op campaign so you could create a faction/kingdom with a bud. Great game!Update 1: 6/4/20 - Devs have been aggressively patching the game since release. This is more than great news. If they keep up the good work we'll probably have a fully-featured working game much sooner than anticipated:).it's buggyit's mount and bladeit's love.so buggy that you should not only save oftenbut also in multiple saves cause there are manymany game-breaking bugs that force the player to start over if there's no other way to avoid loopholes.but also feels not properly tested too. Several bugs and missing textures are noticable right from the start while the game is still on rails before moving onto the sandbox gameplay. You just can't miss those things with even bare play testing. To prove my pointi wanted to visit a castle to see how it looks like so i visited Sestadeim. Guess what; Sestadeim castle exterior was EXACTLY the Lycaron City. This is just alpha material.ok for a 2020 release. Lighting kinda feels weird and fakebut that's just personal opinion. Generaly i'm very pleased.it's still very far from a steady release. If you're ok with that and you think you have the stamina to re-play the game several times untill it's ready and then somethen get it cause it's freakin awesome. It's mount and blade 2.0. But if you think you'll exhaust all your interest and you'll soon burn out before the game comes into glorythen you maybe should wait for a while and see what happens.taleworlds will continue/start improve their game for the sake of everything.Wish This had Co-opThe game is still technically in early accessso there are a few things missing like end-game Kingdom functionality and some dialogue options for companionsbut overall it's entirely playable in its current state.this game is a true successor that improves upon the previous game in several ways. Those who are fans of the previous game will find much that is familiar to them here. Proxies for different Western powers in the land of Calradiaeach with their own culturesstrengthsand weaknessesand the ability to aid or hinder them. There are some quality of life improvements as wellsuch as the ability to speed up map time by 2x and food not rotting. Towns and castles too feel much more fleshed outthough like in the previous games there is no real need to walk around them and you can avoid doing so the whole game given you never buy a workshop.there are some amazing additionsmost notably smithing which allows you to custom create weapons how you see fitand some others like siege weapons.namely tournaments and trade. Now tournaments provide unique items in addition to the gold you betand trade is much easier to get involved in and serves an important part of the beginning to mid-game. All in allmuch of the game has been smoothed over and polishedretaining much of the older Warband feel while still being an improvement in most areas.the combat. For all the improvements to the base game mentioned abovecombat remains one ofif not the largest draw to the series. I have to saythey did a damn fine job at it too. The combat here is so SATISFYING. Warband was funand it functions much the same herebut like everything else it has been improved upon. Hits feel a lot meatier as you ride by and cleave someone in twain with a polearm from horsebackduels feel much more tense as weapon handling has been refinedand troop controls have been improved with the ability to select different formations as well as delegate troop command to the AI (sergeants). The battlefields look gorgeousalthough with noticeably repeating layoutsand the large scale battles are breathtaking.where troop commands were present in previous games but not quite as fleshed out or as central as they are here. The only thing I miss is the ability to tell troops to advance or retreat 10 pacesas well as the fact that the AI seems to have much more fine control of the troops than I can possibly manage.the game is great so far. As a Warband junkieit feels like much the same gameonly *better in almost every way*. The economy feels more involvedgame mechanics more polishedand the combat more exhilarating.I feel like a lot of people here forget what Warband was like or how different Warband was compared to the original Mount & Blade. Warband offered some added functionalitymultiplayerand something of a narrative but was effectively the same game as the original. Even with the Diplomacy modthe marshal AI was atrociousmarshalling fickle AI lords was even worseand the limited amount of quests were far more than frustrating. You can't pay me enough to herd zig-zagging cattle to armiesto deliver inconsequential messages across the mapor to fight up and down 80 degree inclines ever again.Bannerlord is arguably the best medieval simulator on the marketmaking it more than worth its value at its current price point. The influence system alone is a godsend. No more dedicated marshals and no more soliciting every peer in the realm for votes. Influence controls votespoliciesmarshallingand maintaining army cohesion. I love it.giving your archers a line of sightusing your cavalry to harry and flankand maintaining infantry line disciplineespecially in battles with 800+ men. The maps make combat even better. Bridgescresting hillsnarrow valleysriver crossingsrolling sand dunesand more. Each of these terrain types demand different tactics.dead. Ring a guy with your glaive and he spins around in the direction you struck him. Fantastic.approached the Khergit heir afterwardsand proceeded as planned. We have a kid now and his name is Junjadbut I affectionately refer to him as Junchad. I've only encountered one or two bugs that I couldn't work aroundwhich makes this early-access release more than playable in my eyes.but they too need some work (e.g. laddered siege towers are useless). I suggest cracking walls with four trebuchets (after racking them up in reserve) for the best experience.I find the emergent gameplay qualities to be superb. I've rolled two characters: first with the Battanians and now with the Khuzaits. I've adopted my own roleplay rules (over recruitmentexecutionsand lofty ambitions) each time and the game enables that. I once got shot off my horse and was about to be swarmedonly to command my cavalry to sweep in and save my life as if I were Jon Snow. Too much fun. I've noticed some women die from childbirthmaking lords bachelors again. Feels like a realbreathing world. It'd be nice though if lords and ladies killed each other every once in a whileseeing as they breed like rabbitsbut I'm sure that's to come.TaleWords doesn't make any other games. This is it. With 100+ employeesthe potential is there. I wouldn't hesitate to buy as a former Warband player. As a newcomer with different expectationsmaybe it's worth waiting for the full release. Up to you if you want to have fun now or later.so after my first 144 hours in gameI have decided that the early access has a really strong foundation.combat is excellent (including horse movement and weapon use)the battles are excellent (including formations and orders)Sieges are much more improved from warbandwith the addition of optional siege equipment. The towns feels alivethe factions are interesting and feel different culturally.it feels pretty freeand not too complicatedwith some nice benefits to putting time in to skills you are using in a way you enjoy the game anyway. Trading is funand a good way to make some cashthough the economy needs work as a whole (talked about below).as it just plonks you in the world alonewithout a main story (much like Warband)though the story is fun the first time (desptire the tediousness of constantly getting repetitive quests)is also amazing. Getting a spousehaving childrenwatching them grow upstart families for themselveseventually dying of old age and having your child take over is very immersive.as its really over/underpowered depending on what you are currently making. Though its necessary due to the below.it needs some work mechanicallyfor instanceallowing lords to join youdespite their clan's intentions. This could work either as the Lord forming a new clanor they are put in a ""rogue lord"" category until they are back in the same faction as the leader of their clan.OR your council can just agree to pay a daily tribute to stop the fighting (againwithout agreement from the enemy you are paying tribute too).or escape very easily without your say or ability to stop it. This means that during a siege for exampleyou can defeat a lordcapture themthen have them come back with a new army during the same siege. That is a mess. You should be able to lock people up forever if you so want (or at least only have it so another lord breaks them outor a tiny chance to escapebased on the security of the settlement).the early game is incrediblethe mid-game is funbut the late-game only is really fun if you are a vassal. Having your own kingdom just isn't fleshed out yet.and instead having diplomacy work on merit and situation alone would improve the game tremendously.If you're deciding whether you should wait to buy the gameor go for it now it all comes down to how much perfection you expect from a game in early access.there have been no crashesor major gameplay issues. All issues seem to be visualwith the graphics not looking as good as the videos and promotional picturesbut still overall pretty good. Minor other issuessuch as starting battles in first person and seeing the backs of your eyes/eyebrows are the greatest problems I've encountered. Those are solved by switching from first to thirdthen back to first person so it's not the end of the world by any stretch of the imagination.save your money until a few updates come out and maybe invest it in some chill pills in the meantime. If you're okay with a game that's perfectly playablethough a little rough around the edgesyou won't regret buying the game. Overall Bannerlord is a massive improvement over the originals and I'm very happy with my purchase.[b It's almost harvesting season.[/bthe balance is brokenand many systems are being worked on and implementedbut these issues that every Early Access game under the sun has pales in comparison to the sheer scopedepthscale and fun of the most ambitious Medieval sandbox game to release in the past decade.[/ucrashesand broken balance as an early access"
1,"I would have reviewed this soonerbut that would mean leaving the factoryand the factory must growI started a co-op factory with a close friend After a day of workI stepped backlooked at what we builtand came to some realizationsone of the machines producing copper cable for another machine to assemble into circuit boards is halfway across the god damn refineryand the rest are going so many directions this thing looks like a ball of yarnand every time it gets bigger it somehow becomes MORE labrynthine One of those fucking conveyor belts goes all the way around the entire factory to deliver steel plates to a single assembler thats making bloody gearsand its right next to the refinery itself!and the breaks we do spot are often half an hour old and are a recurring problem Rather than fix itwe simply unjam the machine and ignore it until it breaks again The biggest problem to fixing it comes from our production lines Normal production lines look like a grid Ours looks like you threw a bunch of squares into a bowl of spaghetti noodles and gave the bowl to a five year old for a period of one to five minutes This proccess results in either an empty bowl and a full five year olda floor covered in noodlesor spaghetti all over the walls and ceiling with the squares nowhere to be found Knowing the trend in increasing chaos and complexity the factory exhibitsprobably all

those genresbuy this game I already know you will love itI really like the fact that you have no time whatsoever left to spend on trivial things like my wifethe kidsfood or workAfter 8445 hoursyeah I think I would recommend this game to a friend  It's like crack spaghetti crackSo you can probably tell by the review score that the game is more than capable of meeting players' expectationsbut what do people come here for in the first place?people with engineering degreesthe entire population of Germanyor at least people who are ""into that technical stuff""but that's only partially true Factorio issimply puta fun videogame about building things with an industrial space theme If you liked tycoon games like RollerCoaster TycoonTransport TycoonRailroad TycoonZoo Tycoonor citybuilding ones like SimCityCities Skylines or Caesar 3you probably already know the basic gist You build a sprawling factory to gradually achieve a singlebig taskand it's really fun to watch it in motion The big twist on the formula that Factorio brings is that it borrows crafting elements now common in modern mainstream games to make the building less a matter of using money to make moneyand more about crafting basic resources into usable items It just so happens that these items are buildings that you build your factory out of In essenceyou're building a factory-building factoryhence the common mantra ""the factory must grow""though At the top of the crafting pyramid are the so-called ""science packs""a complex item that exists solely to be consumed to progress the game's tech tree Said tech tree starts you off with simple tools to familiarize yourself with the basics of mining and smeltingand eventually branches out towards truer and truer automationculminating in a factory that literally builds itself using thousands of flying construction drones The mere prospect of that can make a new player's head spinbut in reality the game actually gets easier once everything gets automatedsince you can just sit back and watch things happen The ultimate goal is naturally to climb to the very top of the tech treehowever you don't have to worry about aimlessly building up to that point since there are plenty of interesting intermediate steps worthy of investigation The game sustains a steady drip-feed of new technologies that often change up the formula completelysuch as new forms of power productionitem transportation or even access to completely unique production chains like liquid oil and radioactive uraniumso you're very unlikely to go bored during the 40-60 hour playthroughit can seem as though the game is very complex and hardbut as I said beforethe bigger your factory getsthe more you can afford to chill For this reason the game rarely gets described as ""hard""but it's not exactly a cakewalk either You do get an infinite amount of space to build your factory however you wantbut at the end of the day the resources won't craft themselvesand a bare minimum of planning is required to lay things out at least a bit logically You can build your mines on the opposite end of the factory to the smelters and connect them with a single line of beltbut you can't expect to smelt a lot of items that way (been theredone that) Not that it's necessarily a bad way of doing thingsbut let's just say there's better ways as well This extends to practically all facets of Factoriomaking it a game that's easy to play (and beat)but practically impossible to masterI love it lotsstill returning to it now and then for a playthrough whenever I don't have better things to do that week It's well and truly one of the best games to come out of the past decade and I wish more people built up the courage to give it a shot Did you notice there is a free demo? If you're still on the fencegive it a go You're welcomeFactorio is a game that sneaks up on you You start out so simpleharvesting some coal and ironchopping down a tree or two Then you plonk down a machine that starts mining iron ore for youand you feed the result into a furnace You build more machinesthen some inserters More machinesand it becomes easier to link up a few things with conveyor beltsso organicallythat at no point you felt overwhelmedbut you can't stop now - you just build a tank and you really want to try it out on that alien base that has been growing way too muchthis game has actually changed my lifehow can anyone manage to focus on all that at once""watching others and taking it one step at a timebecause you can beat it"
1,Finally I can sack Ole Gunnar SolskjÃ¦ri spent Â£120 million as Newcastle and i'm still only 8th in the league 10/10 for realismspurs are terrible very realisticFirst of all i would like to thank my great friend Samuel Seal for gifting me this great gamei would like to warn anyone that has a wife and kids that they will end up hating you as your love for Juve Stabia or other lowly obscure teams grows into an obsession fuelled by Just Eat and Deliveroothe data hub is a good addition and the match engine is smoothalthough there are some things that need addressing at some pointlike the ridiculous headers for instanceon floppy disc hahaha (who remembers Champ Manager italia??) and they never get old for mein my first 55 hours playedI didn't play a single matchWas really tossing up buying the game as didn't have any particular saves planned Have 1000+ hours on FM21 (and similar numbers for FM18/20) and thought that the game didn't look different enough from the previews I was shocked when I played the game and noticed so many new features/UI updates The data analysis update makes the analytics easier to understand and provides more precise information on how you your players/team follows your tacticsits even really fun just going through in depth and finding hidden details In terms of gameplayI don't have a great understanding of the enginebut my first reactions are it looks more and more like your team is actually playing football and its not just the same 8 or so different highlight packages that FM can often feel like The Centre Backs is where I've noticed the greatest differencenot just with the new Wide Centre Back role (which is a lot of fun to mess around with) but even with Ball Playing Defenders actually making runs forward like you'd see in a real game and not just mulling round on the ball before launching a long ball into space Finally if you like doing the small stuff like attending press conferences and team talksthe dialogue feels a lot more randomized/unique this year (so far) Overallif you love FM22 provides so much more than just a roster updateand you're bound to notice the subtle changes in details that make all the differenceI buy FM every two years It's better than FM 20I've enjoyed playing the game for the last 2 weeksnot a lot has changed from last years release but i wasn't expecting much changei just enjoy the updated teams and player improvementscompany greed makes me sick in my opinion this isn't aimed at new comers as i truly believe they wont even know about the in game editor at firstnooo this is aimed at us lotthe loyal fan base who return year after year 50p increasefine but an almost 50% increase is filth This isn't about the price as the IGE is still quite cheapbut nothing new has been added to itnothing has changed from the last decadeso why that much of a price jump  imagine next years releaseand the full game costs Â£72would we be happy with that?Play As Liverpoolnewcastle 200mIf I was to compare this game to FM21comparing your players with the rest of the leagueand analysing the oppositionas the quality of youth players will change depending on the nation's standingallowing you to assign scouts to more specific areas of a continentand look like they were done using the airbrush in MS Paintlike to do build-a-nation savesor just want the database updateI would absolutely recommend picking up FM22 If you only use plug-and-play tacticsare a casual playerand/or are tight for cashthen maybe stick with FM21 as it is still a good gameBeen playing now for 56 hours and love it apart from one thing too many press conferences!

The card is materialized from thin air and does not come from his deck.the voice acting is very nicely done.And rememberthe most powerful card is your Credit Card.Now you can send 5 year olds to the Shadow Realm on PCI've played over 4000 duels on the mobile version as I'm writing thisand I'm sure I have at least a few hundred hours invested into this game. I enjoy playing this game a lotand I'll explain why this game is worth my time here.the newerflashiermodern TCG is too fast and lacks strategic depth. Synchro summoning may be passable for somebut XYZPendulumand now Link summoning is... weird. We miss Tribute and Ritual summoningand we enjoy the slower format of the game.and that's why Duel Links is so appealing to people like me. It brings the game closer to what we originally enjoyed from the TCG. Suresome adjustments were made like smaller decks and a smaller playfieldbut the essense of the original game is still captured here.it's natural to be concerned about this game being P2W. I won't lieyou can get a pretty big advantage by paying real money. Let me make a case for playing without spending money though. If you compare Duel Links against HearthstoneDuel Links shine in many areas. As a F2P Hearthstone playeryou log in each daygrind out your quests and [i]maybe[/i] grind out some additional currency by winning games. If you're a new playeryou're likely up against veteran players who have accumulated a large pool of cards making it hard to play against themwhich makes your own accumulation of cards rather unenjoyable.PvE is a massive part of the game. [i]Yes[/i]it's grindybut not in the same unenjoyable manner as Hearthstone. PvE scales as you progress in the game and eases you into more complex gameplay and strategies. It allows players to enjoy playing the game without making PvP the only way to grind out cards.Konami is extremely generous with handing out currency to buy card packs in the game. There's usually a new event every weekand if you put in some timeyou can get quite a bit of currency with a relatively low investment of time. Since playing the game when it first came out a year agoI've only spent around $15 on the gameand I have a few fun decks that I use competitively. I also have a lot of fun making creative decks and messing around in casualunranked games too.you'll find that ranked play is very rewarding. The game has new seasons every monthand each season resets your rewards list. One thing that Duel Links does great is rewarding you for playing competitively. I'll pick on Hearthstone again. In Hearthstoneyou log indo your daily questsand that's pretty much it. You don't really have more incentive in playing any more games for the day. In Duel Linksthere are no daily caps in what you can earn from ranked play. Theoreticallyif you spend your entire day playing ranked and winningyou can amass a lot of rewardswhile still being able to play more to earn more. That is something I appreciate. Some daysI just feel like playing a ranked game or two to take a break from PvEand some days I go full HAM and spend hours playing ranked. I feel well rewarded in both cases.it really is just a port of the mobile version. Howeverthere are some real benefits and convenience in playing it on PC. These include:which facilitates building decks.you'll appreciate the fact that Konami managed to get all the old voice actors and actresses to voice their old roles. Konami's keeping an eye on the power creep in the game. I'm sure it will grow in the futurebut with the amount of effort that Konami is demonstrating now in curating which cards are added to the gameI have confidence that Konami can keep this game from spiralling into the nonsense that plagues the modern TCG.people from MTG and Hearthstone to try something newpeople who just want a nostalgia trip back to their childhoodand people who have never heard of Yu-Gi-Oh too It really is a fun time building and playing decksand that's the dream of any collectible card game enthusiast.You might have to use the most powerful cardyour credit card.Rememberthe most powerful card is your Credit Cardmy wife left me>Pick Kaiba because Blue-Eyes White dragongo up against a generic girl Duelist NPCDo you like Yu-Gi-Oh Cards and anime: Yu-Gi-OhYu-Gi-Oh GXYu-Gi-Oh 5D'sYu-Gi-Oh ZEXAL?

Howevernew players are at a disadvantage from starting late. I have been playing this game since release (Over 4000 hours) and I had a lot of funbut the meta is very important. If you want to get KOG (King of Gamesthe highest rank) normally you need to have a Tier 2 or Tier 1 deck. Konami just wants to make moneyso whenever they release a new pack in Duel Links the Meta changes drastically and you would need to spend over 30k gems or drop some cash to get enough copies of a card to use in your deck. It is very hard to get enough gems to buy all the new packs as they keep constantly releasing more packs. Once they add a new pack they nerf older cards so you are forced to get new packs. You do not have to play the meta but if you don't follow the meta then you would have a hard and frustrating time trying to rank up.a lot of stagesand a lot of characters you can focus on leveling up.thus expensive to continue staying KOGThis is my favorite game to roleplay as Seto Kaiba bullying school children.The best card is the credit cardIT'S TIME TO A-A-A-A-ACTIVATE YOUR CREDIT CARD"
1,"Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooteras it is soso much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that itâ€™s developers hold sacred and are proud ofand one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But itâ€™s even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platformupon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come.Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim.

New comers to the Arma series (as I was may initially be overwhelmed by the gameâ€™s complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often briefbrutaland more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-mapsno enemy UI icons/indicatorsno hit markersno health bars. If you get shot a couple of timesyou will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new playersit provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awarenesscoverteamworksuppressive fireand generally moving purposefully and as if your ass depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehiclesarmorhelicoptersand planeseach with their own realistic mechanics to learn and masterand you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience.Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate actseach containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3â€™s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewardingand challenging. (I have yet to complete it as Iâ€™m stuck on one mission that I simply canâ€™t seem to complete.all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.oh god the multiplayer. WastelandKing of the HillInvade and AnnexBattle RoyaleBreaking Pointso many Co-Op opportunitiesthe amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha. Iâ€™m sure there are so many others that I havenâ€™t even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to comeand they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.[h1]Immersive & trying // Recommended for those that cherish depth & complexity[/h1]save for a few issues here and there (i.e. empty buildingshas largely aged well & looks fantasticcontent-packed single player campaign; player choices do affect potential endingsas there are severalwhich helps SIGNIFICANTLY to combat the monotony of walking/running very long distances between objectivesto underwater missions& everything in-betweena little practice goes a long way & serves to open up a slew of options on the battlefield& vehicle sound effects tend to sound strangely mutedsome of the dialogue is a bit awfulbut for the pruposes of a video gameit can put players to sleep in some missions& the tutorial felt inadequate overall; mechanics are amazing on paperbut take an inordinate amount of time to masterThis is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gamingthis is a game for people who appreciate the finer things. Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BFexperiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release.I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s.no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrainkeeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower.and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed.I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the towerall the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measureif one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way backas I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall backhope growing that I might get out of this alive.from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect missionnot a shot fired and all under my command back alive.Having accumulated over 13400 hours in-game with [i]Arma 3[/i]I would certainly recommend it to others.it's well worth a look; especially if you appreciate a high dose of military realism!this game ruined my life.......10/10Its starts with you buying it on a sale because you want another shooterfind out that its not that kind of a shooter and stop playing it for 3 months minimum. Decide to give it another shot but play by its rules and you find that you actually enjoy its complexity. Then somebody comes over and saysyou wanna try this but Vietnam and also be in a unit with other dipshits that enjoy this game and you say yes because Vietnam sounds awesome (Spoiler: Its not and you want to play with a more organized group.you have spent 4 years playing with the same group of peoplewhile having 20 FPS on lowest settings and the game is keeping 1 of your week days hostage as you have scheduled events every week. You also subscribe to the Steam forums and check reddit to find more victims to sacrifice to BI so as to have their next patch not fuck up all the 58+ mods you are using 1 hour before your operations...simulation or the answer to the question: How can I commit a war crimes but not be punished for it.

I love how difficult this game isand I love all of the different features the game provides. It is NOT easy to hit a target with an assault rifle from 300 yards in real lifeand this game seems to match that same difficulty. Fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real life...Arma 3 makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gearor you will have a hard time hitting your target. Enemies are not stupid and they have great vision. I was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 3-5 second rushes when moving. The AI is more advanced than the average taliban are in real life. haha :p Given my love for the military and for videogamesthis one is definitely one of my favorites of all time :DWhere do I start with Arma 3...have I played enough of this game? Nonot in the slightest. My total playtime (see above is pathetic in comparison to those around me. I see upwards of 200030004000 hours just looking at the reviews currently. At the time of writing this reviewI sit on a measly 61 hours of gameplayso I am in no way an expert of this game.rapid paced combat. Battlefield slows it down a bitbut maintains a good balance of action and spacing between engagements.which adds massive suspense and makes every firefight veryvery meaningful. When combat initiatesthere is definately adrenaline pumping actionbut it's not fast. Combat is very slowalmost methodical (just like real life but veryvery... awesome. Some things that you'll see in an Arma firefight that you will not see anywhere else:often hundreds of meters awayespecially if you're roaming the hills or open wilderness. Enemies may only be a fleck in your scopeon another hill entirelyseveral football fields away from you.you'll be forced to take cover and locate the enemy the old fashioned way: watching and listening.you probably wont have time to react. One or two shots will kill you without much warning.Anti-TankHeavy Gunners all have a part to play in their teams success.squadees must be willing to take orders and communicate with their superioirs. Directions will not be called out like ""LEFT! RIGHT!"" but rather with compass bearings such as ""There's at least 3 of them at... 248""stand up super tallsit downlean on your sidebend your body left and right etc.. Manipulating these stances and using them to show as little of you as possible may be a key factor on whether you live or diebut you might also give your position away or get shot as you peak out of cover. Forget to look left? Arma teaches that wherever you don't lookthere will be something that kills you.your squad may advance only for one of them to be shot by a (very much alive enemy solidereverybody continues their daily routines and hopefully somebody with anti tank weaponry deals with the 15 ton chunk of metal. Armored vehicles are terrifyingly powerful with weapons foot soldiers can only dream of. A whole squad of 20 people will immediately hit the deck if one of them shpws uphoping that their AT guys can do the job because...or ""HALO jump""which teleports you to an exaxct location but 6000 feet up in the skyforcing you to have to use your parachute to land safely. HALO jumping back into combat is suicide. Big shiny glorified baloons make reallyreally good target practice. That also means...you're hooped unless someone takes the risk and picks the launcher off his dead body. That isunless the tank/armored car blows him up before he gets there. Then 20 people are stranded with very little to dowhich means...entirely. It took us upwards of an hourbut  we checked every single buildingroom by roomuntilIn the center plazathere he stood; the last man we had to kill. All the other building were checkedand I saw a head poking out behind this obstacle in the dead center of the city""Central Gardenstraight north"" I notice he pokes his head around the corner. My assault rifle was depleted.missfiremissrinse andrepeat. I empty my whole clip and the man is not dead. So I reloadand just start Terminator walking my way towards this guy. Firing every round I have. The guy doesn't poke his head out anymore. One clip exhaustedthen another. And another. This guy will not die. I least I'm supressing him.shoots me once. Dead.talking about how wicked that mission was. We get a new onesomething about planting a bomb somewhere.at least. We just kept talkinggetting closer to the LZmocking the pilot for driving too low to the ground. We land and immediatelythe chopper comes under fire.My first game on A3 brought me the most horrific experience I've ever had in any gameever.a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint acrosstelling my men to hold back. I cross a few more timestrying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing.my Autorifleman runsmy Medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across.he played it up to 11 here.drenched in his own blood.RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGEH-HELP ME! C'MON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!""would recommend getting.I had a lot of fun. But its time to step away from old faithful and move on until the big number 4 comes out.had lots of funraged often and broke a great many monitors and miscellaneous peripherals. 8/10I'm not into arma anymorebut as you can probably tell from the amount of hours I've spent paying this game; I've had an incredible time.and neither too silly. It was very balancedvery fun. Very replayable.so let's talk about other things:obviously - as the game is all about fighting lol.and other things such as weapons becoming less effective as the bullet travels mid-air..you also have very aweosme-looking postures which you can adopt; from laying proneto sitting on your bumto crouchingleaning side-to-sideand all dat weird jazz.you can only take 1-5 shots before you die pending on which weapon is used against you and what kind of protective gear you have equipped. This means that you have to be VERY careful in-gameotherwise you might just get shot in the head and die. PersonallyI enjoy such hardcore mechanics.you're likely to take a hell of a lot of damageand this is where armour becomes a huge importance; without armouryou are as vulnerable as a mouse surrounded by a horde of cats. I shouldn't even need to stress how much you need armour! You can go lightor heavy - your choice. The amount you wear does affect movement speed thoughso do be careful of that. It also affects how badass you look; I generally like to go light so I look like a badass mofo who is totally capable of destroying anyone who crosses my path lol. Not only thatbut your appearance can also affect how easily an enemy can spot you. So if you have a huge bag on your backand lightly coloured clothes- you can be sure people will spot you with ease.I know. But I am most certainly not done! We have to talk about the tanksand the awesome vehicles that can totally blow ur balls off!there are about 20 different ground vehiclesall unique in both appearance and purpose. You have a few anti-vehicle tanksa few anti-people tanksand a few artillery and anti-air tanks. PersonallyI love the artillery....they're like mini nukes lol.long-story-short -- arma has tons of vehiclesall awesome in both appearance and nature. Very useful for committing mass-genocide on dem pesky capitalist NATO forces....mmmmsatisfactoryso you're not restricted to just playing one gamemode and getting bored after an hour. I believe I've already listed one already; roleplay. Others include but are not limited to(due to custom game modes etc; TDMKOHKTFPLAYER VS AI(forgot the official classificationsorry5v5 COMPETITIVE MATCHES (like that csgo competitive game modecustom zombie modesand survival modes. There are also singleplayer game modes which you can hostsuch as Zeus or custom Addons which allow for various different gameplay experiences; which brings me to my next topic...to Star Warsto enhanced combat system and mechanic modsxcom modsand various others which add more vehiclesfactionsarmour/clothingmore aietc...so you can rest assured that you'll be able to configure almost anything you want.so lag shouldn't really be a problem; especially if you tune down the graphics via the settings menus a bit.as I've briefly mentioned previously(with the game modes. This game is almost solely multiplayer-basedbut singleplayer is a thing and can be funso don't feel restricted. This game being focused mainly on multiplayer is obviously good for playing with friends. You can have much fun playing with friends online in this gamemuch fun indeed. Lag can be a problem thoughso make sure you have a decent internet connection and don't be disappointed if you can't play with a friend based half way across the world from you : but personally I feel the devs have really improved connectibility over the passed years in terms of multiplayer. Id say it's currently at its peak.so I advise such.I'm starting to like it I think. Will definitely play it a little more.First time playing ARMAim new to the game"" in chatA rapid cacophony of impacts broke the monotony of drivingaccompanied by the chatter and crack of automatic fire hitting the vehicle. The person next to me that I had been talking to was deadslumped over and covered in blood by the time I realised we were in the middle of an ambush.as it's wheels had been taken out by a 40MM grenadeandbecause I had been shot in the legcrawled my way into a ditch at the side of the roadwhere I passed out and died.after all this timeI can finally review this game.which is rather extreme. You will initially be very confused by things and somethe AI and the ballistics in particularare very complex and not well explained in-game.the game opens up and it's absurd freedom starts tp show- you can do ANYTHING in this gamedespite it being presented as a military tactical game.people working jobsdriving around and having a police force and jobsto the Survival and post-apocalypse gamemodes revolving around the pursuit of food and waterweapons and transport to stay alive.which bring a Battlefield style gameplay mode into Armaand you have the original BATTLEGROUNDSwhich was so popular it is now available as a standalone game.making the already impressive realism to ever greater levelswith things like new weaponsuniforms and vehicles covering every nation in the worldto advanced medical modes that take into account blood losssurgeons and battlefield trauma / medical care to fantastic and impressive details.and range from small groups to friends to massive clans with over 300 active members- Arma can support over 160+ players in a single multiplayer gamein addition to hundreds of AI soldiersso the scale of some of these groups in without comparison to anything else except EVE.from how the ballistics and each individual round is modelled in the gameand affected by velocitydropzeroingpenetration against various materials from woodbricksteel and body armourto rounds being able to bounce and deflect due to high-angle ricochets on hard surfaces like concrete or vehicles.and the game covers everything from underwater combat and submarinesland battles with infantry and tanks with modular damage to systems and partsmaking it possible tofor exampleknock out a tanks tracks and turret without destroying itleaving it totally helplessall the way to next-generation jet fighters and advanced radar detectionthermal and IR technology.to commanding a tank crew in a pitched battle in the Iraqi desert during the Gulf Warto evacuating wounded soldiers from thick Vietnamese jungles in 1970before using an American aircraft carrier to stage for a dogfight above Russia in the modern dayall in the course of a few hours.who add a massive range of things to the gamefrom new vehiclessoundsmapscampaigns and new missionssystems and anything you can possibly think of- Someone has either made it or is working on it- from ALIEN and Star Warsrole playing free roam and Police carsto every weapon and piece of equipment used by the BritishAmericanFrenchGerman and Russian armies over the past decades.and never even touched the multiplayer aspects until after that.and Steam Workshop support for mods and missions is fantastic.and revolves around NATO forces on the islands of Altis and Stratis (based on real islands off the coast of Greece and their fighting with the native AAF armed forces and the more advanced CSATbased on an Iran/ ME alliance.and you are thrown into a situation where you are NOT the winnersbeing constantly on the back-foot and fighting with lesser equipment and as guerrillas and insurgents fighting against a military with superior armaments to youwhich is a nice change from the normal state of affairs in gameswhere you play the exact opposite.your style of play and if you do the optional free-roaming mission.pinflank and use a decent level of tacticsso it's often best to take some time to plan your mission in advance- What cover is in the area? What is the sight-lines and visibility and is a stealth approach possible? Where are the enemy patrol routes and is there any chance of enemy reinforcements? What type of enemy soldiers and equipment do you suspect they have- night visionmachinegunsmarksmensupport assets like vehicles or static weapons can affect your approach to your objective.which has some great presentation and polishbased on Tanoawhich is a fictional island off the coast of Fijiand is a utterly STUNNING looking mapwell worth the price of the Expansion.off the coast of Fiji and Australiaand follows a smallwell equipped British special forces groupCTRGand their fighting against the Syndikate drug Cartel in the jungles. As special forces you are often deployed at nightand have access to advanced equipment like thermals and night visionputting you at a technological advantage over the Cartelbut the Cartel have greater numbers so a stand-up battle is often a fatal problem- it's often possible to avoid patrols and soldiers. Apex also adds a wide range of weapons including the AK-47MAK-12AKS-74UHK416 and HK417M249 SAWMP5K PDW.particularly in Multiplayerthe performance of the server and the mission is paramount- MOST of the highly popular and heavily scripted gamemodes will not get 60 FPSregardless of settingsbut with a good server and mission you can achieve 60+ FPS. The game is biased towards CPU clock speedrather than the GPU like most other gamesso a higher clock CPU sees much better performance than a GPU upgrade.and the DLC's always come with free platform updatesadding new features like bipodssound overhaulsnew weapon and clothing features like thermal concealmentadvanced helicopter flight models for more simulator-like flyingand many others it would take too long to list.put simplythe most widely varied and impressive game I have ever playedand the absurd number of hours I have in the game  is a testament to it's great communityauthentic gameplay and varied experiences.3 bazillion reviews. No one will read this.Breakdown of my 3000 hours played since beta-releaseand people gave this game a really bad name for the first year it was out. I say to heck-with them allbuggy betas make for fun times with good people.grossly over-played and exaggerated. Howeverit was still good and there were plenty of mods on Armaholic we could download to try out. Ended up being a learning experience for everyone.and workshop is starting to show its head. This was the time that I spent having the most fun in this game. Learned how to play during this time period and began working on content creation  and mission making.developing my own mislim group. I have spent the majority of this time mission-making and hosting servers. This is the peak of what I would say is my 'overall' experience playing this game. After learning everything I can and passing it on to new playersI feel exhausted but very satisfied.and I would recommend it to anybody. You don't have to milsimand you don't have to play it like a military game. The mod community and public server community have brought plenty of roleplayrpgtdmcoopand koth that anyone can jump into right away. Aside from thisthere are even more private communities with the most amazing and unique experiences that you could have while playing this game. If you are looking for a game that will challenge your leadership and charismathis is the game for you. If you are looking for a laid-back experience to socialize in a virtual world with your friendsthis is the game for you. If you want to feel like you are down in the dirt fighting alongside people you just met whom you now consider your closest friends under stressthis is the game for you. Arma 3 has brought MilSim gaming to another level of coolI have owned this game for a number of weeks now and I have been completely hooked. Great game for the more serious war gamernot for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway.similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longerI personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward.the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to.and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game.After some 1400 hours on the gameI can say with FULL VALIDITY this game has ruined my life.teamworkand every form of warfarethis game is for you.Right before i get started - I was a massive fan of the Arma series and have been for 10+ yearsit is the reason i bought my first gaming PC.it remembered all my modsdownloaded them then i fired the game up.before you know it times up and you cant be bothered. It was like that. I sat in the in game menu for one minute (screen shot to prove it before deciding not to play. I exited the gamesteam and shut down my PC.battleye do. Please contact battleye if you need support with a ban.'steams explanation of a DEV BAN which states a developer informs valve of an account that is suspicious and valve ban them. I have sent images of my conversation with BE and proof that in the two weeks before my ban i had one minute of game time which was spent in the menu.OH & 3 but it looks like this is the end of the road for me. I will miss the random chats in gamethe communities i was part of and the battles of the field.if you guys blow this up they might just let me back :"
1,"An example to all those stuck in Early AccessI'm impressed by the developers work ethics hereIn my opinionthis is the best roguelite deckbuilder ever made and also in contention for the best roguelite ever The design of the game is close to perfect -- every cardrelicand enemy is in for a reason and serves a purposeand there's almost no additions to the game that serve to just up the item count without offering interesting playstyle consequences It's very easy to understandand yet that betrays its considerable depth and endless replayability It's very good!My boi NL convinced me this game was the best roguelike crossed deckbuilder game he'd ever played  He was rightI love card games of all types I grew up playing traditional card games like Crazy EightsSolitaire and Uno I later got into BridgeRummy and Poker until Magic the Gathering (MtG) consumed my life for yearsThunderstoneRace for the Galaxy and many more I had a ton of fun playing thesebut again it is hard to get a group together on a consistent basis so I turned to the PC Several of these games have pretty good PC versionsbut they are still restricted by the fact that they are based on physical games There are often clunky mechanics that really slow things down That's fine when playing with friends at homebut over the Internet or alone against an AI it tends to get old pretty fastbut most of them are based on card collecting and those can rival even Magic the Gathering in cost if you want to stay up to date with the best cardsA game it took me weeks of hearing people talk about before I finally gave it a chance This little weird looking card game has somehow managed to tap into so many things I love about card games and video games that when people ask me about it I struggle to even say anything about it because there is so much I want to sayyou pick them up and see if you have a good hand That rush of excitement at the possibilities of what your hand has for you never gets oldits why I got so heavily into Magic the Gatheringsince apposed to games like Bridge or Rummy you get to draw new cards constantly This is also true for deck builders and even more so with Slay the Spire than many others since you play your hand fast and don't have to worry about building your deck while you're playing it This brings me to my second pointso you know what your deck is missing before you pick your new card I really love building my deck as I play with itits how I used to tinker with my MtG decks back in the day and the reason why the physical deck building games appealed so much to me Slay the Spire has the incremental building of a deck builderbut without the constant ""stop and think"" style of play which slow those games down This makes the pacing of the game much more interesting You have an action phasefollowed by a thinking phase Rather than jumbling them both into each othermore so than any other deck builder I've played While games like Dominion and Thunderstone have a lot of different card combinations for you to play I simply find myself enjoying what I can do in Slay the Spire more It also plays very fastit flows a bit like Heartstone in that senseunless you have very complicated deck combinations which requires some forethought or specific play orderswhich usually is either attackblock or apply some buff/debuff This means what you do on your turn is informed by that If the monster attacksyou blockif it blocks or buffs itself you attack Having this kind of AI interaction in a physical game could be possiblebut would require a lot of dice rolling or boring set up between rounds As you play the game more you start to learn how the different monsters work and develop strategies for each of themmaking each game a little easier than the previous Its not just your deck that's getting betterits your ability to play it as wellwhich is one of the reasons why MtG can take forever to playbut with the game being digital all this is taken care of in the background The digital version of Magic the Gathering handles these things for you as wellbut since its rooted in a physical game it is a lot slower and more cumbersome than Slay the SpireCivilization being my favorite game of the genre That genre has the ability to captivate me in a way that makes me just play on and onone more turn at a timeeven though I know I should have stopped hours ago Slay the Spire does the same thing for me Each game of Slay the Spire consists of 3 floors with multiple encounters with a boss at the end of each floorif you die or win you get some experience points towards new unlocks and you can start again on a new run It plays similarly to a Rogue Like in that waya genre that I've always been fascinated bybut never got very deep intobut Slay the Spire got its hooks into me very hard It took me quite the force of will to say ""No"" to another game so I could take the time to write this review I can't wait until its over so I can try out the latest patch Which reminds meRim WorldSubnauticaPrison ArchitectOxygen Not Included and others that actually listen to their communityprovide regular updates and already have a game that is worth playing as it is Slay the Spire in my opinion joins the rank of these great games without question The technical aspects of the game is top notchit plays smoothlythere's a ton of content and it has received multiple significant updates over the few weeks I've played it With a clearly defined Roadmap that promise more content in a game I feel already has enough content to justify its price 5 times over I have no doubt that the game will be finished and even if development stopped today I would be more than satisfied with my purchaserestricted cardsspecial relics or modifiersnew cardsmore monstersnew charactersetc I feel like this game has managed to do one of those things that you don't really see all that often It has taken the best from many different genrescombined it in a new way and created something greater than the sum of its partsA while back I tried Darkest Dungeonand I was constantly googling items and strategiestrying to figure out what does whatand I was always stressed that I was going to do the wrong thingI have hardly googled anything to find out what it doesit just immediately makes sense And rather than being scared to try things outI can't wait to see what every card does The game makes you feel like you're actually good at iteven if you're not that good at itI never found it (in my ten hours) to be really unfair Sometimes you get a garbage handbut maybe your next hand will work And I even died multiple times without wishing pain on the creators of the gameand that is the best compliment I can giveI don't have a lot of time for gaming anymore and with around 1000 games in my library I've never even playedI'm trying to cut back on buying new ones So when a friend told me I [b]had[/b] to play this oneI was skeptical I do love card games and strategy - but I also have a lot of burnout from poor Early Access experiences and since my maternity leave is over and now I have to ughmake money AND look after a babyabsolutely no spare time for gaming So I surprised myself when I realized that three days after launching thisI'd managed to clock up 15 hoursthe unfinished laundry and my mums messages asking if I'm okay because she hasn't heard from me for a few days may be related in some waybut you can't prove anything! I was so tired last night I beat the final boss with the Ironclad for the first timesent a screenshot to the friend who bullied me into playing the game (essential step)turned my PC offwalked to bed and fell asleepto dream of deck buildinghis playstyle choices have been vastly different He prefers Silentthe poison characterwhereas I prefer Ironcladthe strength deck He'd never used the style of deck I used to get my first win (barricademassive armor stackingdual wield into body slam) and I played with quite a few different deck types before settling on my winning synergy Even though there are not a massive array of cardsthere is a significant amount of choice and strategy in your playcoupled with constant adjustments needing to be made as you pick up relics and rewards000 reviews (no I mean literallythat's not a meme) and overwhelmingly positiveyou don't need someone slow to this bandwagon to describe the mechanics of the game What I will say is this is a fun roguelike deck-building card game that is simple to grasphard to master and incredibly addictive I'd love to say it can be played in short bursts when you have 30 minutes here and therebut only if you've levelled your willpower to max and can walk away from the PCeven in Early Accesswith hopefully even more content to comeplease follow  [url=http://storesteampoweredcom/curator/28971565/]My Curator Page[/url] ðŸ’–pretty good game except for the jaw wurm i cannot for the life of me understand how the devs put out patch after patch without nerfing this ridiculous enemy you might as well put the final boss of the game on the first floor runs are won and lost based entirely on enemy rng butr otehr thanf thatquite goodlove the graphicsNo one will ever read this but I recommend this gameIt's a good game with high replayability I play it to escape the big sadJust wish it was also mobile so I could play at work and probably get firedplease make mobile versionRemember when you where young and you could play a single player game for hours/days/weeks without getting bored? With growing age it seemed no single player game could give me this feeling anymore Until I got Slay the Spire This game is a masterpiece I got hooked instantly and could not let go anymore It is worth every penny Buy it!I've bought the game three times on various platformsMy account says 19 hours played-- I have over 500 hours on this game on iOScool moves you can do""levels"" that you need to go throughyou knowvideo gamey stuff It even has potions StillI decided to look at it as something a bit more than just a video gameand I was likeyeah this is stupid difficultdo people actually win against this?and yeah people win against it Not only thatbut they win against it with handicaps It starts off with one handicap Then you get another And another It's like you already have the odds against youbut you stack them against you even more And moreup to 20 different disadvantages to start off with Yet people still win consistently at the game How is that?I started to understand In this gameyou're given a deck of cards You can't control what cards you will findnor what elites or bosses you will encounter Never the lessthrough your own decision makingyou can turn squalid conditions to your advantage and come out on top despite the oddsI decided to view this as more than just a game It's a simulation that demonstrates the power of making decisions that have thought behind them Decisions that weigh pros and consthat consider consequences I learned that a bad situationeven if it is bad and will certainly end baddoes not have to be [i]as bad as it gets[/i] By carefully considering optionsstudying the situationone can mitigate whatever negative aspects exist in any given situation If they are also luckyor particularly giftedthey may even reverse it into a good situationand as a good demonstration of how powerful this concept is I was able to go from a situation I really was convinced was hopelessto being able to regularly and casually beat that same boss that I thought was impossible a year backwith at least 10-12 different handicaps on top of that All because I changed how I think and how I made decisionsyou still have an exceptional game to playThe hours on record speak for themselves[h1] TL;DR Sum-up [/h1]and build their character and deck with random drops Slay the Spire has players strugglingscreamingragingthen asking for morebecause thatâ€™s how fun Slay the Spire iswhich palliate for its lack of artistic polish and uneven pacingits formula is meant for challenge seekersto which I recommend it even at its current price Newcomers to either card battle games or rogelike/lites might want to wait for a discountlove your decklose your deckrinse and repeat[/td]then draw a card[/td]your daily dose of frustrationyour git gud experience of this year[/td]facing long odds[/td]soundtech: [/b][/td]bonfire screens need much more work[/td]musicacting[/b][/td]5/10 - Appropriatelacks character and immersion[/td]gameplay: [/b][/td]new experience every playthroughbut somehow unevenly paced [/td]worth the price?[/b][/td]great potentialworth the price if youâ€™re into Rogue gameplaygrab on sales if youâ€™re new to the genre[/td]the badthe meh[/h1]very rewarding power tripwhere each floor becomes the setting for a confrontationa strategic choice (gain Xlose Y)a bonus or a mercantile transaction Combats are fought by carefully picking cards which will trigger various offensivedefensive and strategic effects Along the wayplayers will build their character thanks to random cardgoldand bonus dropsin hope of finally reaching the top andeventuallyrestart from the bottom and/or compete in a daily run event Three different playable characters are availableeach with their own set of cards and unique gameplaywhere players will have to improvise and make sweetsweet lemonade of of runs that sometimes feel like the ultimate lemon storm; card and bonuses drops obtained after clearing a floor are randomand if a build will certainly evolve throughout a given runhow it will evolve is down to luck and very strategic choicesthen struggled for the next 8 hours) That saidcard games are random by natureand this formula is meant to appeal to players who enjoy facing strong and uncertain odds To somewhat balance this built-in unfairnessthoughthe developers have implemented a forced flush mechanicwhere unplayed cards automatically go to a flush pile after ending a turn This system helps knowing what card will come next and allows nice little tricks such as digging in the flush pile for that one card that might very well change the issue of the battlesome other aspects could benefit from a lot more polish The art is sometimes painful to watch (bonfire screens in particular need a lot more work) and I personally found the music and sound effect lacking impact Too standard and repetitive to be immersiveno dynamic soundtrackvery few sound effects for the variety of cards providedand generally forgettable themes; I do play on mute That saidthe game still being in early accessthere is still hope for improvement and in any casethe art doesnâ€™t matter that much once a combat has startedthe only real downside of the game is its animations With no variety whatsoeverthey are also slow enough (even on their fastest setting) to account for a good 30% of a turnâ€™s time depending on how fast players take their decisions With nothing to justify this length and no skip optionthey increase the duration of single runs and decrease the fun/time ratio Added to the general boredom of the first 2 or 3 fightsand a title that could be much more nervous currently suffers for an unequal pace that can become uncomfortablewhich palliate for its lack of artistic polish and uneven pacing Its freshappealing formula is meant for challenge seekersto which I recommend it even at its current price Newcomers to either card battle games or rogelike/lites might want to wait for a discountI fell asleep in the middle of trying to finish just one more run and woke up with the controller still in my hand the next day This hasn't happened to me since I was a little kid so I felt the game deserved an early reviewMultiple characters with their own cards and playstylesa real solid difficulty curve that rewards strategy and punishes carelessness Though it is in early access and more content is always appreciatedthe core gameplay loop is complete and very entertaining A quick browse shows the developers update the game on a weekly basis and seem fairly responsive to community concerns and ideas Definitely recommend investing into the game before it leaves early access and it's price increasesif you are like me you will need to fiddle with your Pro controller in the game setting and get used to wrong Xbox positioned icons being displayed for your face buttons The developers seem aware of the issues and hassles and are looking into itIt's like cocaineEverytime you think that you're going to make this awesome buildyou die and then suddenly it's already 4 amNothing's perfectgather cards as you climb up and fight battles/go through events/rest at campfires/shop at shopsand then hopefully the deck grows into something cohesive enough to challenge the bosses of the Spire Mechanicallyit's quite simple - deal enough damage to reduce the enemy's health to zerouse Defend cards to protect against incoming attacksand your deck reshuffles when you go through the whole thingthe game uses this mechanical simplicity as a rock-solid foundation to build complexity and depth Cards like ""Draw a card Discard a card"" can become the absolute foundation of a deckwhile a card like ""Deal 32 damage"" can be an absolute dead draw depending on your other card picks Relicspassive bonuses to your characteradd another layer to consider You have a relic that lets you keep drawing cards when you empty your hand - should you focus on 0-cost cards and eliminate your higher cost oneswhen removing cards from your deck is a rare and expensive service?and while it may not appeal to everyoneit's at least refreshing and fun It's a funny game without leaning too hard into humorit's a cute game without leaning into weeb cutenessoverall everything is at the least well-madeif you enjoy roguelikesABSOLUTELY PICK THIS UP"

That just sounds ridiculous and it isrewardingand enjoyable There's a lot more than just ""farming"" too There's the aspect of building a farmlaying out where buildings will goorganizing tractorstrucksand tools There's the whole financial strategy part too; do i buy this tractorlease itor continue to use the old basic piece of junk for another harvest or twoand should i plant corn and turn it into silageor plant soybeans for profitmaybe plant oat and bale the straw afterwards? It's just crazy how much honestly goes on in a simple simulator And with modsthis game can even become a farm manager game as you send workers out to plowcultivateharvesttransport cropetcgetting stressed and frustratedbut then come home and relax as I just let the tractor drive lines up and down a field plantingor use a harvester to collect cropsand it's just so damn easy to get lost inbut this is honestly one of the best games I've put my time into I mean568 hrs at this point in time It's worth every pennyI got this game cause i want to feel like Jeremy ClarksonAfter playing for just a couple hours I already couldn't even imagine going back to FS17 80 hours laterfarming still feels better than it ever did before Good job Giants :Dno Herculean strength to flip tractors with a piece of wood and able to rotate items in-hand Looking forward to conventional balers at this pointsteering feels much more realistic (using keyboard)you can feel you're driving a several ton piece of machinerysuspension and ground response better than everinstead they have wear and tear that you have to fix for a small fee (similar to what Seasons mod did in FS17)resulting in massive decrease in passive running cost for the farm (idle vehicles don't cost you)land/field expansion feels more natural with having to buy the land Buy a forestcut down the trees and turn it into farmland!although placing stuff on anything but a very flat ground can cause issues Upcoming terraforming feature will fix thatpotentially Also choice of buildings in base game is limitedbut I'm sure modding community fill flood the game with dozens of new items soongreatly expanding on the ""fertilize 3 times"" approach from FS17more stuff to do between sowing and harvesting phaseshorsessugarcane (for those without FS17 platinum) All with their own mechanics/machinery More variety of stuff to doeven if cotton is pretty bad profit compared to other cropsmuch less clunky although somewhat buggy at the moment (weeds will overtake NPC fields permanently)as eggs will spawn in boxes without having to collect them manually Placeable animal pens require higher initial investment in livestocksimilar to buying fields for arable farmsfull 3D preview of machinery and its configuration (""Does this tractor look silly with narrow tires and painted pink? Did that trailer have a hitch on the back or not? I'll just look and see!"")game feels to be running smoother than FS17 too Big improvements in lighting and atmospheric visualsyou can easily see the difference in the overall image and feel of the game Beautiful sunsets and night lights :)engine sounds stand out much more than in FS17much cleanermore readable and compactseem to miss less parts of a field on angled edges thoughit seems 'aiming' the cuts is less intuitivepieces of wood can still get glitched after cutting (weird collision box and mass) and still missing any sound when a massive tree falls down Need that satisfying 'creeeeeak-THUD'none are too serious or game-breaking (as far as I've encoutered)It ain't much but it's honest workStep 1: Buy gamerealy fun game when you have no friendsI've pissed 356 hours of my life away on FS 17so naturally I bought this game 4 hours before release andthats great I simply don't understand the people leaving negative reviews because the core gameplay is the same What the hell did you expect? zombies? a battle royale mode? Theres only so much you can realisticly do in a game primarly about farming Anywaya sound hiccup when using the chainsawand a visual glitch with rain coming through the cab of certain vehicles Ive also heard about multiplayer connectivity issues but as a single player only person I can't comment  These issues exist as of 11/20/18pedalsect as of 11/20/18so its absence is probably a calculated decisionif you're coming from a heavily modded version of fs17 you'll probably be a bit disapointedthe graphics look a bit crisper and cleaner In particularvehicle interiours look a lot less 'plastic-y' Hard to descibe but compare fs17 and 19 and its noticableand so far works just as advertisedwhile smallhave alot more detail and are generally more fun to explore than those in base fs17 the devs clearly took insperation from the modding communitytheres a sense of weight behind them now There is however the physics issue mentioned above with pickups as of 11/20/18the biggest new featureyet butstill good~ DIFFICULTY ~Background:  450 hours in FS151250 hours in FS17give it a few months to work out the bugsweeds)frankly I don't carechanging the API so drastically and not given documentation out early means that we have to wait for the good mods (Follow MeCoursePlayGPS)but that is par for the course with smaller dev shops  They had to get money coming in and hit a November release date for the holidaysAhFarming Simulator It all started that one nightbrowsing the Steam store for games on saleand I stumbled upon FS1920% off And I chuckled a bitthinking 'hahthat would have been funny Sitting herepretending to be farming!'wanting to see how people actually played the gameand I watched a guy filling a silage clamp for 45 minutestalking about his dayto purchasing the game - I don't know But here we areover 300 in-game hours later and not feeling a natural stopping point I've purchased a complete setup - steering wheelpedalstwo joysticks and to top it off - a newly revived YouTube channel where I post my gameplay I'm waist deep in this gameand I regret not trying it sooner It's an addicting gamewith a lot of different ways of playing itand that's something you will too if you start playing Make sure you have loving and understanding people around you if you plan on purchasing this game - because you'll find a sudden need to tell people around you about farmingI wish my Wife's Father could have seen this Simulation  Graham was  Dairy Farmer in Wiltshire and i'm sure that he would have enjoyed giving me 'Tips' with my Game Play The only thing missing from this superb Sim is the smell of sun warmed Cow Dung As Graham walked out to meet his Staff he would often be heard to saymy friends make fun of me for playing this game but I recommend this gamegood game i have modded this game and i am now a humble canadian cannabis farmerPress R and you can pet the dogsWellover 3000 hours played  Trust me  It's a good gameFrom casually puttering around a couple of small fields and using low cost low power equipment and driving your meager harvest to market to giant harvesting machines with collectors so large you cant drive them on the roads must tow them semi trucks and large capacity trailers to haul the larger machines bountiful harvest to market farther and faster maybe you want to grow cotton or tend a flock of sheep ride some horses or fill a tanker with milk   youll need to feed these animals and thats where the game starts to shine as you start to explore more and more crops and farming types as you earn more money you can buy more fields more buildings to house your growing fleet of machinery  and then you discover modding and we go from mom and pop roadside stand crops to consumer product manufacturing with custom buildings that take your raw crops turn them into ingrediants then you then take to another place to manufacture soda other drinks coffee theres many more what about cutting down trees for profit? theres a whole sub genre of mods and maps made specifically for logging then we have mining and using what mines produce to make other things to make other things to make other things to build more buildings to make other thingswant to use all the functions that some materials offer but the game lacks using? mods exist to expand all facets of the farming industry and beyondas all games eventually do those hiccups get ironed out and then the modders start going to town dozen new mods a day it seems are released to the in game mod hub alone  thats what gives this game its legssmall old timer farms and tractors like your grandparents used?or to take wood products to to make more wood productsor about this game i highly suggest giving this one a go before i discovered farming simulator in the 2015 version purchased in 2017 and before that point i was a driving sim kind of person with a heavy lean to online shootersand a side thing for massive mmorpgs and single player giant explorable world rpgs but farmsim has always been an interesting and fun experience"

In this game I could do all the things I was once able to do but in my twilight years can no longer do. There should be more games like this for us seniors. The graphics were exellent. I very much dislike and dismiss the cartoon type graphics in most other games. The visual aspects of the game were superbrealistic and sometimes even breathtaking. The attention given to detail needs to be congratulated. The storyline was only just satisfactory but this was complemented by all the interesting charecters involved. Please continue to amaze us gamers with your excellent work.The best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and the second part of The Witcher. You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgradestill makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever createdit finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1something that makes you forget that's just the video gameit gives you the feeling you are in therein some villagecity or that you are fighting with someone / somethingwhich turns every single battle into an unforgettable memoryand believe methere is A LOT of themis actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGsfinally a game dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at allit's decentthough it's nothing to be praised reallyyou won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodgeuse signsand on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his or her misery.although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issueseconomy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be)small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions). Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them.one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).There is a reason why The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has an average rating of around 98%. The storytellingthe graphicsthe atmospherethe voice actorsthe overall scope of the gamethe soundtrack and almost everything else is absolutely stunning and TOP NOTCH. I've been playing the same savegame for almost 100 hours now and I still haven't finished the main storyline and sidequests of the main game. Where else do you get so much game content for your money?the game has some small weaknesses and bugsbut considering what you get in the Game of the Year Edition for a price of only 1499 â‚¬ (during the Holiday Sales for example) is simply amazing.but make sure to install the ""The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project"" mod (can be found on Nexus Mods) as well. It makes the game look even better while not asking for too much more performance from your PC.nor do I like writing reviews on Steambut this game is a solid 98/10You know how when you complete a good TV show or book series you always feel empty cause you got attached to the characters and you know you will never enjoy their company again?The only bad thing about this game is the emptiness you feel after finishing it.28 years of gamingthis is the greatest game I have ever played and likely will ever play.  Bought it on release day in 2015 and came here todau just to write this because someone asked me at work today if this game was any good.and I can never experience it fresh again. It may have ruined all future games I will ever play.A game where side quests are more entertaining then other games main storiesSince playing this I have a legit fear that there won't be any game like this anymore.So we got a game in 2015the complaint of which for many people was overwhelming contenta game that wanted to push boundaries in terms of narrative and choice/consequence based decision making in a living and breathing open worldwith characters that are memorable and relatable. A game whose developers knew what gamers wanted. WItcher 3 has launched CDPR into the league of great developers like Looking GlassRockstarValveold-Bioware etc.....it's not even funny.My personal Game of the Decade-Silver for monsters. ðŸ—¡ï¸I bought this game for 15â‚¬ on a sale.should have bought it for full price.Just f*cking buy it already.not greatit's on sale for $20.I quit cocaine to play Witcher.so I did and became obsessed and didnâ€™t even want to leave my room to score drugs and stop my cold turkey withdrawals because I was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ playing Gwent and winning.

1,"Rebirth is an amazing game! It improved on flash Isaac in almost every single way you can imagine and has served as a platform for a lot of new content to be added to the game People have strong opinions about the way the game has developed since its releasebut there's no denying that Rebirth itself was a slam dunk and a grand slam One of the best roguelites ever madeand a huge inspiration for other developers in the genre ever sinceThis game's greatest strength is its replayability and sustaining value It may be one of the highest hour-to-dollar ratios in single-player gamingyou will love the way this game continues to challengeand challengeand challenge furtheryou will be continuously pleased every time you find a cool new rooma game-changing itemcrazy synergies between those itemsand the games plaethora of well hidden secretsthis game will not only please you with the gargantuan number of achievements on displaybut also in how the game integrates them with the core gameplayrewarding you with in-game unlocks for almost every single achievementwhereverand enjoy a short but enjoyable gaming sessionthis game is perfect If you are in this categorybuy it on the Switch if you have onethat becomes very disheartened by dying or losingis squeamish around gross imageryor who doesn't want to have to look things up onlinethen you might find this game doesn't suit your tastes One feature common amoung content rich games like thisDon't Starve or Minecraft is that they are often very hard to penetrate due to their emphasis on experimentation and unexplained featuresrequiring wiki usageand other McMillen games like Super Meat Boy often deter those that justifiably claim ""This game is too hard"" or ""This game is gross!"" While very fun and rewarding to the kinds of gamers listed aboveand highly recommendeddo beware that if you are in this categoryI do not recommend this gamewhat no father figure does to mfMy first attempts at The Binding of Isaac resulted in me repeated dying in the first room I entered Almost 2000 hours later in game I can now sometimes survive as the lost Despite the frustration of dying A LOTthe challenge of getting further and further in game was what kept me returning day after day Two years later it is still my most commonly played gameDiptera Sonata & Ascension (Chest Fight)hard at times) game with a lot of charm It's given me quite literally thousands of hours of enjoymentBinding of Isaac: Rebirth is a remake of Binding of Isaac with new graphicsnew mechanicsnew monstersnew items and every aspect of the game has been enhanced New content has been added everywhere possiblethe game feels infinitely smootheris so much nicer to playand has many more hours of content to keep you satisfied for longer If you enjoyed the original Binding of IsaacBinding of Isaac: Rebirth is going to be infinitely better and I can promise instant satisfaction This review will consist of comparisons between the original and Rebirthwhatâ€™s goodwhatâ€™s badpossible changes and just an overall look at various aspects of the game including everything that comes to mind It is often a bit ramblybecause I talk extensively about every detail I like and every component that irks me For a full recommendation of the game and a continuation of the reviewvisit the last paragraphwhere you find various items which can be beneficialharmful or simply useless to your overall goal of surviving You shoot the enemies with your tears to kill them while running away from them and their tears to avoid taking damage Once you diethat run is over The game is perma-deathso you have to start again from scratch The game is also absolutely [b]disgusting[/b] There isnâ€™t too much bloodbut knowing that these monsters have lived in your dusty old basementbeen transformed into ugly mutilated creatures and that this is what becomes of you as you take pills and pick up items is gross Once you get past the horrid enemiesthe game is pretty simple and is extremely fun to all who like the challenge of a game like thisall of which have different unique aspects Some characters are easier to play than otherswhich in the eyes of many peoplemakes those characters more fun I wish the characters were more balancedbut itâ€™s very rarely possible to have 10 different characters you can play as that all play with equal difficulty There are bound to be some easiermore fun and more interesting charactersand thatâ€™s what makes them unique Something thatâ€™s missing from the classes howeveris all the characters being unique Some of the playstyles of the characters feel too similarand some of the things that made characters unique in the original Binding of Isaac have disappeared in Rebirthan interesting aspect of Samson that made him a challenge in the original game Ratherhe starts with 3 red heartsprobably to accompany the change in the item of Bloody Lust making it a damage output increase relative to the amount of damage taken for the entire floor This is an interesting changebut it makes Samson more of a tanky charactersimilar to Magdalenerather than the weaker character with more potential I believe a better change would have been to give Samson a spacebar item and keep his stats the same as they are in the originaland the effect of Bloody Lust relative to the amount of kills you get while still maintaining itâ€™s effect over the floorthe item that made Cain a fun character to play in the originalhas been significantly nerfedmaking Cain a character that lacks a truly unique aspect While Lucky Foot is still a luck upa single luck increase does not have much of an effect as most items that use luck to work require a lot of it to work extremely well If the Lucky Foot could still make the Fortune Machine work all the timeor at least most of the timeand increase the luck stat by multiple points rather than just oneCain would be a much more interesting character to play and much more uniquewith a bunch of items now using the luck stat to perform more efficientlyall methods of gambling in the game being affected by luck and it now being shown on the pause screen when you press escape Theyâ€™ve also shown all the statsincluding shot speed and luck as previously mentionedon the pause screenwhich were not there in the original gamewhich wasnâ€™t too bad in the original but in this game there is no â€˜tellâ€™ (something that means heâ€™s going to do a certain attack) for when he is going to shoot itand before you can move out of the waythere is a laser and youâ€™ve been hit The same thing applies to the Lumps in the womb and the Mom eyes in the red champion Mom fightwhich shoot instantly upon popping up and you have no time to react to the high speed shot There are a lot of enemies that do similar thingsand still a lot of rooms remain where itâ€™s almost impossible to leave without taking damageand a lot of similar aspects like that It makes the game more uniformbecause now there are a lot more interesting spiders which were missing from the original game and a lot of new versions of both flies and spiders which add a lot to the challenge of learning new elements of the gameclose the gameand start again from where you left off at a later point You canâ€™t start another run while in the middle of a previous one without overriding the previous runâ€™s databut itâ€™s still an extremely useful featuresince in the previous game we had to leave the game running to continue a round of BoIbut they can now be a single normal roomas all the rooms were in the original BoIthey can be double rooms extended either horizontally or verticallyand they can even be quadruple rooms that extend in both directions The animation for travelling through such rooms can apparently cause motion sicknessand it can be turned off by changing something in one of the files (Iâ€™m not quite sure what) PersonallyI quite like the animationand it makes moving around large rooms extremely funthis game is easily worth the $15 if you liked the original Binding of Isaacand at the time of the making of this review there was no DLC released (if there ever will be any)so that might be added in the future This is an action packed perma-death roguelike with infinite replayability and hundreds of hours of gameplay to unlock all the achievements and secrets

unrealThis game makes me want to kill myselfthis happened to my buddy EricToday I FINALLY got 100% achievementsso I think it makes sense to finally write this review  I've sunk well over 1000hrs into this game spread over several yearsand I can confidently say that none of those hours were boring  There were definitely more than a few playthroughs where I wanted to tear my hair out in frustrationbut the fun and excitement of making it to the end with the perfect item combinations makes it very rewarding as well  If anythingthis game definitely has high replay valuesoundtrackand of course the awesome gameplay  I think I am most impressed by the way some really disgusting and disturbing things were made to look really cutethis is one of those rare titles that far exceeds its hype

But the harsh combat isn't the only thing that makes this game hard It's the queststhe worldthere is NO handholding You got to figure out what to doyou got to figure out which quest to solve and focus on And boy are there many quests to focus on!some seem like just a typical sidequest kind of job that ends up being the key ingredient in solving the big mystery! I love thatI love that the first act has you stuck on an islanda jailand your job is to break out And how would one do this? There isn't just one wayor twoor three There are more than that Way more And it's up to you to figure out the wayhumandwarfelflizardand undead Each brings with their own talents and experience in the game You might have trouble with certain quests because they hate your raceyou might need to find another way into a town because they don't like dwarves It's extremely immersiveand playing it as a coop makes it even soI played this on Tacticalwhich is hardand on some boss fights me and my coop partner would sit here for two hours Reloading Repositioning Changing skills Reloading over and over untill we finally managed to beat said boss It was one of the most amazing experiences I've had in gaming all year Just that little bit of having to figure out how something workscheer him up and he'll help you That nasty fire elemental? Guess what! She needs your help!and people dislike you because of itbut somehow they managed to make the entire game voice actedwithout starting another kickstarter and without pushing the game back a few months It was a surprise untill launch and I give them major props for doing this)i know Fort Joy better than my own FlatI thought I would put down some of my thoughts on the game after over 150 hours of playtimeyou immediately realize that it's taking a lot of cues from very old-school RPGs You pick one of several classes for your character (BattlemageClericEnchanterFighterKnightRangerRogueShadowbladeWayfarerWitch and Wizard)pick a few skills to go with itand customize the look of them You're then thrown into the worldtrodding along a beach where you find many interesting things about the gameuntil I made my mind and went for my final settings""Why am I picking up these shells?"" and couldn't really explain whyaside from that's just what I do in games with loot Soon afteryou come across your first fightand this is where it differs greatly from most other RPGs out therewith each member of the fighton both sideshaving their turns in a set order (the order can be affected by turn-skipping status effectssuch as being frozen or stunned) Each characterwhether yours or AI-controlledhas a set number of action points they can use for their turn You can move to a better positionwhack a nearby enemycast a spelletc These all take up your action pointsbut you are able to end your turn early and save those action points for the character's next turnand it's a tough one It feels incredibly old-school in it's level of difficulty and really rewards players who go around gaining XP through exploration and side-questsas well as those who are extremely skilled in thinking out how exactly to approach a fightso you conduct electricity a bit better There could be poison on the ground that could effect where you need to run All of these can be affect by the player as well Wanting the enemy to stay at a range? Throw down an ice spell so they have a chance to slip and fall on their backs if they try to move closer to you Enemies are coming into melee range? Perhaps throw a firebomb in their path to start them burning and cause damage to them before they even get close It's a fascinating system that I've never seen before in the gameand it makes every encounter so deep that you find yourself scanning the environmentyour inventoryyour spells and your party set up just to see what is possible for that fightthere's little to no hand-holding or help Your quest log is literally a journaldescribing your heroes' journey so far in their own mindsessentially It makes you explore and thinkrather than blindly follow a marker to find your next objective This resulted in me getting lost repeatedlyfor a great deal of timein the very first city of the game The number of side quests I picked up was staggeringand the lack of direction just made me try to think outside of the box to try and find any way to progress with my murder investigation There are even some incredibly fun encounters you can run across in your time with the gamewhich has a wonderful sense of humour about iti have found Tactician mode fun and challenginghas a ton of contentand is a blast on your own or with a friend  I highly recommend this game!DnD for when you don't have friendsYou will love this game ifif you don't sit there scrolling over the map looking for hidden chestsladdersledgesetcyou're doing it wrong*turn based combat that rewards forward thinking and planningusingselling or collecting lootor really focusing on the bugslets get realor have line of sight on a target they clearly should80% chance to hit is more like 30%; anything under 90% is troublethe real fun comes from exploring the world and finding everything else there is to do I honestly can't believe how good this game is for an EA release and I can't wait for the full release come September Could not recommend highly enoughI know)more synergy between spells This is already greatbut why stop at great!the more I realise I'm just asking for more of the game Give me more of the game mateThis may just be the best game I have ever played I hadn't played the first Divinity Original Sin gamebut I purchased this because I enjoy rpgsturn based gamesand games that can be played local coopbut never did I expect what came next - my girlfriend liked it too We played this game every day for weeks and weeksloving the explorationexpansive storyand difficult but rewarding combat Finally we beat the gameafter maybe 200hrsin what was a campaign where we thoroughly explored every corner of the game So then we bought Divinity Original Sin 1beat thatthen started a lone wolf campaign on 2beat thatand still we were finding stuff we missed through the first playthrough I seriously cannot recommend this game enough Alsothe aforementioned girlfriend is now my wifeand I am not saying that is because of Divinitybut it certainly didn't hurtI was tired of games that only tests your reaction skill I was tired of games that say it's 60 dollarsonly to have randomized loot boxes or micro-transaction implemented later in time I was tired of games that were advertised to be wide as an ocean but ended up being shallow like a puddlewe cannot wait to identify it to see who can make use of the item Quests are a joy to do and often leads you to find more quests that's filled with important decision making Every choice you make has an impact on the world and I have been sent to jail multiple times for making the wrong decision For $4499 you are not buying a game but an experience An experience to truly go on an epic adventure Fights are never easy but once you learn the satisfaction of besting the enemy combatant that you failed to take down multiple timesyou are left leaving for more glory (Currently playing on Tactician Mode)depthand quality give this game a try I have been playing this game for over 102 hours and I have a feeling that this is only the beginningAnd that's itafter 278 hours of playthe adventure is overwhere you discover everythinga bit like a childto tell a storyto make the player laugh tooand to make him a little melancholic or horrified or even sickened sometimeslike Sonic and megadrive gamesPokÃ©monFFTacticsZelda and gameboy / gamecube gamesWarcraft3 (TT)or Mass Effect and other PC games did in my childhood and adolescence (I surely forget so much excellent games)I say:an adventure to live!like I went through Kanto (PokÃ©mon)or Ivalice in FF Tactics as a kid!discovered and lived in these worlds!it's the same thingand not alone this time: I was with a very good friend!and Maladieand Garethand Jahan and Han the survivor kid and Sir Lora and so many others Impossible to forgetI know they exist ![/i]provoking reactions (or death) in certain charactersslapping a few Magisters around when necessarywe STRONGLY decided to stea Borrow a lot of spells and equipments from the merchantswhile the other one was distracting by chattingwe had the moneybut you never knowmaybe one day we will need it !it's fun And exhilarating heheheto play with friends Really !

Great gameThis game is a masterpiece Easily one of the best games I ever played in my lifeyou notice your characters actually develop and become way stronger with each level and each new gear equipmentthey can either help you or turn against you For example your friend could tell the guards that you stole something and they will put you in jail! or you can make your friend distract traders and you pickpocket themIf you like turn-based RPG's with lots of customization and a good story to put along with themdo yourself a favor and buy this game This game will leave you wanting more every time you put it down Choices matter Characters are interesting Combat is fluid This is one of the betterif not bestTurn-Based RPG's out therefor what you're buyingan extremely generous price They knew the fan-base and what people wanted and how bad they wanted it They still did not take advantage of us Larian Studios has earned my undying support"
1,"I have played the game for nearly 800 hoursand man I am bad at it But that doesn't keep me from playingbecause it's awesome I have read a lot of complaints about campersso let me assure youI am one of those campers Hunt: Showdown allows for many a play stylelike rushing in with a shotgunduelling with pistolsor sniping from far away There are at least a dozen weapons which allow a sniper playstyleso don't complain about it I have played computer games for nearly 40 years nowI'm 55and I cannot (and would not want to) compete with the Fortnight Kiddies (like my sons)I will continue snipingand I will desperately try to push my KD past 060 - a task of herculean dimensionsThis issimply putmy favourite gamechallenging PvPvE game You play as a bounty hunter tasked with killing a high value target in an area infested with some sort of dark magic The only problem isyou're not the only hunter out thereyou kill the targetyou banish the target then you have to escape the map with tokens proving it's you who killed itwhich means there will be 10 more people who are intent on stopping you leaving with that bounty And almost everything you do can be heard by everyone else on the mapmeaning you have to move as quickly as you canwhilst going as quietly as necessarywith the right balance of risk and reward Most things you do in a match earn you an amount of cash to take to the next lobbywhere you can then either save for a rainy dayor buy higher tier equipment for your next loadout Butanything you die with is lost to the bayou - hence the risk If your hunter survivesthey get experience and you can use that to buy some traits that make them marginally better for the next run outwhere success leads to a higher probability of success on the next runand so it seems inevitable that the good get better equipment to be even more effective - so how can a new player break in?so favours closer quarters fighting The starting shotgun has the longest one-hit-kill range of all the shotguns Ultimatelyplaying to your loadout's strengths and being better than your opponent has a FAR higher contribution to your success than the exact equipment everyone loaded in withit's learning the game There are (currently) three VERY full mapseach of which is absolutely crammed with minutiae It's about knowing how to move around compounds without triggering sound traps quickly It's about knowing which directions you're actually vulnerable from It's about knowing which sort of gun can shoot through that wooden wall you know they're crouched behind It's about knowing that when the shot sounds like THATthat means it's this specific gun and how far away they are The burden of knowledge you have to accumulate to become proficient is very highas a potential buyerhave to considerthere is nothing like this gameand listen to and implement suggestions from the community very proactively They are continually improving the game and adding loads of content I have bought a lot of the (cosmetic) DLCpurely to support the teamas I have gotten way more out of the game than the price I paid to get inI keep coming back to Hunt As long as there are other hunters to go up againstI think I might never stopThis is an OLD REVIEW that has been updated to the full release version of Hunt: Showdown Many things have changedand the review is horribly outdatedso I have done my best to include all of the new updates in the reviewdepsite the lack of NPCs or voice actingeven on low settingsshoot goodand make you feel powerful with each shot Also includes bullet speedand one-shot headshots up to reasonable distances depending on ammo typecomplete with weaponsperksabilitiesand consumables to unlock and equipand a near-endless variety to pair and test out togetherto legends wearing black dusters covered in skullstrinketsand scarsmaking you adapt to their fighting styles and how to counter them effectively Some enemies rush you mindlesslybut others will sit back and try to take you out at a distance The AI is simplebut effective at their jobto crows taking off when people are too close The way the barn creaks when you take a step The distant gunshots and being able estimate how far they are by the sound Everything revolves around soundand the sound is beautifulsurebut you have a reduced ammo pool and ammo replenishment compared to earlier weaponslonger reload timeslonger pauses in between shotsand a higher price point You want to be able to keep an enemy suppressed for days? There's a weapon for that you want to stay calmand pick them off with a singlewell-placed headshot? There's a weapon for that You want a single-action revolver with a stock and a short range scope? There's a weapon for that for some reasoneither One game you might not hear a peep the entire roundbut the nextgunshots are ringing out from every single direction You never truly know what's going to happen when you drop into the bayouhaving an objective It's what separates this game from PUBG and Escape from Tarkov Having that tangibleever-present quest in-gamethat requires multiple steps to complete most timesmakes the game into more than a PvP experience It's not something that you can be sneaky about most of the time You have to reveal to EVERYONE where you are to complete your objectiveand whether or not you like the amount of content so far 2 different levels with multiple areas to exploredifferent times of day3 unique bossesand a metric ton of challenges and weapons to unlock through gameplayit can be a real pain if you join with a random partner over and over There is also the choice of playing with group of 3 rather than 2but can be opted out of if you would just like to play in a duo This depends on whether or not you have someone to play the game withand I would highly recommend picking it up if you have a confirmed partner to play withbut the variety isn'twith only 3 bosses to go after This depends on whether you really care about the boss fightsor whether it's the PvP and world that interests youyou need a beast of a rig to run this thing properly It doesn't mean that you won't be able to playbut you'll be confined to playing on lower settings Not a huge loss overallbut some people are all about dem gwaffics and framerates The game seems to be getting more and more optimised with each updateso it'll hopefully only get better from herebecause it's a tough one to cover in a few sentenceswhich is understandablesince the map is massive The in-game loading of objects and enemiesisn't Having a hotspot be completely void of lifethen spawn in 3 tough AI enemies 30 feet away both ruins the immersion and your planning from time to timeother people can still join with a partnerputting you at an obvious disadvantagemaking solo play quite difficult You do get a bonus for doing thisbut it normally won't apply to yousince you'll end up dead Not impossible to dobut takes a lot more skill with a meagre offering to balance it outwhether it be textures getting brokenrewards not loading properlyor server disconnects Every update seems to play around with something unintentionalwhich is probably thanks to the spaghetti code that's held together with masking tape and wrapping paper Expect a few weird occurrences to pop up from time to timethere is a lot of trial-and-error you will be doingand you will be stomped into the mud Over and over I would definitely suggest watching tutorials or videos on youtube on how to actually playbecause there are quite a few concepts that aren't explained anywhere in-game When should you shoot AI? How does poison work exactly? Why did someone throw a lantern at my ""dead"" friend? This isn't Call of Duty You won't know everythingand it will be the death of you Shrug it offgrit your teethand jump back in for revengea large amount have found the mentality of ""This game has been ruined by those filthy [i]casual[/i] gamers"" due to new updates from the devs It hasn't really been ""casualized""but has been made different from what it once was Balancing is a fickle thingand some people would still rather have the game be reverted back to the 06 updateor even the 01 alphasteam forumsor elsewhereare going to be coated in people complaining about how base mechanics and weapons are overpoweredwhile others claim that they're underpowered Burning a downed hunter (which slowly removes him from the match unless his teammate revives him in time) is vilified by a lot of people in this game They cite it as an unfair and stupid tacticlabelling the people who do this ""insta-burners"" Then you have the crowd who oppose this ideasaying ""Is there any reason to not give yourself an obvious advantage over your opponent?""tense momentswhere you run and gun your way through the woods to extraction But you'll also have times where the gameplay slows to a crawlbecause 2 teams refuse to move The team inside the house knows thatwith their shotgunsthey'll be at a disadvantage if they leave their cover to take on the rifle users outsideand the team outside realises the opposite Thereforeboth teams sit on their hands for ~30 minutes without doing anything This gameplay scenario is looked down upon from every anglebut it's because people want the other group to make a mistake Both teams are technically making the right decision you decide on how you want to playnot the communitydespite its flawsthe game is surprisingly stableand surprisingly funfor those who can run it I would suggest picking it upbut I would also suggest picking it up with a friendor be prepared to get destroyed your first few gamesAlright so this was my second experience in the game and I can say it was one of the most epicintense and emotional rollerocasters I have ever experienced in a game I will split this in two partsBOSS RUN and EXTRACTIONhave small gunfight with players who eventually disappearand tensions are already building upthe last gunfire echoes from the boss chambers and everything goes silentgo to beneath the boss room and hide in a corner for some timeso they don't camp his body anymore and I run to him to get him upwe can fight the boss or haul ass -

you just live to die another dayThis game has always looked interestingbut i'd read about the hardcore playerbase destroying everyone else and kind of put it on hold to play other stuff Recently i finally made the plungeand it's been fantastic The beginner experience has not been nearly as bad as i expectedand we have killed teams and extracted with bounties plenty of times so farand it's always exhilaratinggloomy and monstrouswith amazing 3D design and 2D art for things like perks The gameplay is relatively slow and methodicaland you gotta weigh the value of your actions like shooting and running before you perform themwhile still keeping pace This is pronounced more by the long reload timesand the amazing audio design Everything you do makes noise to varying degreeswhich makes you a player magnet if you decide to run and gun or fuck up and make noise by accident Sound in this game is your best friend and your worst enemyand learning how to use it to your advantage is super cool and will improve your chances the mostso this is just me trying to peddle it to you Big recommendationSuper great atmospherea stealth MP that worksthe best sound-based stealth mechanics maybe everyou won't be disappointedSeriouslythis game has ruined me It is in my opiniondespite its issuesone of the best multiplayer shooters of all time The gameplay loopthe tensionthe tactical optionsthe gunplaythe graphicsthe stressthe thematicsthe teamworkthe freedom of playstylethe attention to detailthe skill ceiling and THE SOUND DESIGN all just blend together to make the most unique and wonderfull gaming experiences I've had in my life The developers really have their ear to the ground and do their absolute best to balance and serve the community to the best of their abilities This feels like a love childand it is nurtured I recommend this game to anyone who is even remotely interestedand I promise it will deliver if you are up for getting beamed in the face during your ever so expanding learning experience The playerbase is growing with every month and it fills me with joyas this game really deserves all the love it gets Don't get me wrongits a HARD fucking game But it is truly worth it I just passed my 1300 hours of playtime and I don't see myself stopping anytime soongo for the head and have fun SOLID 9/10Pros - You get to Yee-hawthe most underrated game ever steadily increasing to the population it deserved right from the startGenre - FPS Western Horror Battle Royale with Strong PvE elements50% have been quite the oppositeand this is where the game falls down Someone shooting you as you soon as you spawncamping at the top of stairs with a shotgunor at the extraction point killing you 1 second away from safety Make this game more frustrating than funthis ticks so many boxesso I am giving it a thumbs upI think the only way to make this game great would be to add a co-op PvE mode with optional bots So casual players like myself can choose to have fun and not frustrationJust killed my first enemy Hunter Great experienceFor all my Aussies out there - be aware that this game only presently supports servers in the US and Europe Kinda sucks balls we didn't get the warningbut it looks like it will be quality once (if) they plan to support us Be awareif laggy playing with Germans \After ""testing"" the game for about 100 hours i want to write a reviewfirst of all i went into this game with quite a hypeso my expectations were pretty high and i have to say it lives almost completly up to my hypelets start with the prosi'd say thats 20% truehunt tries to be its own game with other goals than battle royal gamesthe focus is highly on pvp but you can avoid that and go for the pve experience if you really want towhich sadly results in less xp but i think thats a fair tradethe graphic and detailsspecially for a 30â‚¬/$ game are id say almost insane ( but it has a con to it which i will mention later)i didnt expect a witcher 3 map in terms of size but the map in hunt is still big enough for the type of game and for you to feel like you'll need hours from point A to Bbut the details in this mapholythis map is so detailed that i've never seen a map where theres so much love and detail in every cornersure there are some areas where you can go under a roots but thats rareeven so detailed that its almost kind of disgusting if you take a closer look at themflesh falling of everywhererotting skin hanging from their body revealing boneshives growing out of the ribcage busting it openmaggots that eat the skin and so onthere aren't to much enemy-type at the moment and most of them only have small detail changes ( hives wear different dresses ) but im sure if time goes on they will have a good variety like they have with the basic zimbies (grunts)the hunters are pretty detailed toobesides different skin colors they have different clotheswhich all look super detailed even on medium setting (<- this coming up as a con later )they are all highly detailed in terms of lookfunctions and soundthey are a bit of a con toothe optimization in this game at the moment ( there was a perfomance patch so it is a bit better now ) isnt that greatif you dont have a highend beast of a pc you wont get to play this game on highest settings with stable 60 or even just 30 fpsmost people will have 30-60 on low to middle settings with the average pchas its flawsmost and foremost the difference between tier 1 and tier 3 huntersi dont mean that its op that tier 3's have better camouflage because thats finethe difference in loadoutperks* and  starting hp is what makes it hard for tier 1 and 2 hunters to keep up if you're not a highly experienced playerweaponsfor example  the autonagant (rarely used due to its price) is a close to midrange monster and you wont have any chance fighting someone who has this weapon and knows what he doesthat means that there are hunters who use this weapon (1 in 30 gamespretty rare) and wipe the whole server and the price (999$) doesnt really make up for it because its quite easy to make that money if there noone leftmost perks are  unlocked at low levels and most of them are almost essential for your hunterbut stuff like the fanning perk ( lets you fire a singleaction revolver in a way higher rate of firegoogle fanning for more infos )in a game this slowpacedthere should be a downside to moving while aimingbut as it is right nowyour weapon sways just a little and its quite easy to get hitsthey walk from point A to B and only leave their route if they're alertedim no programmer but i think its possible to implement a point C and then switch up the way they walk maybe? just a thoughtim talking about the specter ( pumpaction shotgun )the dolch (autoloading pistol) and the mosin nagant ( bolt action rifle ) they all lose one bullet uppon realoadingthe perk ""pump-jockey"" is a fix for the specter but to be honestif you have the perk equiped your hunter will take the unused round and put it back in because without the perk it gets tossed awayi kinda think the perk is a bit unnecessaryfor the other 2 gunswell theres no perk you'll always lose one round uppon realoadingim mean technically you could pick them up and put them back in but yeajust a minor thing thats bothering menot gamebreaking or anythingthe game is in a pretty solid placeits a hardcore not really forgiving game that takes some inspiration from the battle royal games and makes them harderits a really fresh wind in the shooter genre with only cod bf like games or battle royalall in all i can recommend this gameTarkovbut I don't wanna kill myself as much: Cowboy editionZombies? Scary Birds? Scary Water? Scary Dogs? Scary Horses? Scary Players? Extra scary Good gameI went into this game completely expecting to not be to of my liking and refund itbut I am overwhelmed on how fun this game iswhere I just charge in guns blazing for kills and if I die its fineI respawn I also do not enjoy BRs because you spend a lot of time scavaneging to get killed by a sniper in some corner Hunt not only has that high risk and rewardbut the death is perma ie you lose your hunters and gear when you diethe first few games was brutal and if its your first time in this genreit will be for you too I was playing this game like I play CODsee a guy and then charge hoping to land a kill You CANNOT play this game that way and it was stupid of me to play that way After the first few games I realizedthe game's main foxcus is not the shootingits your tactical gameplay I was not happy that the gunfights were so shortbut then I realizedit's supposed to be that way coz the game is not about the shootoutits about how you tactically reach to that shgootout Gun fights are not supposed to drag outthe stealthily creeping up to your enemy and landing the pefect shot is what is supposed to drag out The perfect game play is you and your team mates spending a lot of time to get the perfect position and kill your enemy with one shot That's the fun part Once you realize thatyou will see how fun the game isso you gotta be careful to not step on branchesglasses or scare off the birds coz the enemy will not only know of your existence but will also know where you are coz the directional audio is very accurate Every stepmovementbullet matters and you have to treat it that wayfor ex there are double pistolsshotgunsmelee etc that you can use for a more action packed gameplaybut even that you have to plan out wellHunt Showdown is not a fair gameand thatÂ´s Okand Counter Strike with their limited maps and short rounds are designed for teams of equally powerful members fighting each otherthan both players have fucked upHunt provides the freedom to change the odds Weapons are not balanced against each other But that is okbecause how you can play can shift the balance in your favorshoot them while they're climbing laddersreviving or healingshooting something else or reloading"

1,"As a retired truck driver of 40 years I never though I would end up playing a game about truck driving but I find it a pleasing experiance when I can travel the European roads which I traveled daily The experiance is so realistic I would recomend this game to all who would like a glimps of the life of a European trucker without all the grind and hardship which goes along with the job Congratulations SCS you have a realistic product even taking into account the suicidal AIThis game is meditationthe thought-cleansing effect of driving a thousand kilometres along the highway cannot be understated Occasionally poor AI choices behind the wheel may spike your blood pressure but overwhelmingly ETS2 is a relaxing thing to stick on after a rough day And if that's not enough you can just drive into oncoming traffic in your indestructible death machineYou knowit honestly feels like a joke at first Thereâ€™s thousands of games out there â€“ some offer compelling storylinesothers offer non-stop thrillsand pretty much all of them let us escape the dull monotony and grind of daily life And then thereâ€™s Euro Truck Simulator 2 Whichunsurprisinglyis a simulation game where you drive trucks around a crude rendition of Europe Okaaaayyou only need to look at the basic gameplay loop thatâ€™s taking place here; you pick a job from a list of options in your area You go and hitch up your cargo Then you slowly trundle towards your destinationtaking into account every road law and speed limitand spending the great majority of your time on vast highways and never-ending strips of asphalt After dragging yourself to your destination for 20 to 30 real-time minutesyou drop off the cargo â€“ and do the whole thing againthenthat this isnâ€™t for everyone; thereâ€™s a good chance a few of you have fell asleep merely reading the last paragraph If you do actually get to the point where you boot up the game for the first timeit even does a lot to try and immediately frighten you off Youâ€™re instantly met with a plethora of menus that are incredibly overwhelmingallowing you to do everything from create a profile to adjusting your X-axis sensitivity for Wellsomething The tutorial then doesnâ€™t help mattersbasically stemming down to telling you â€œJust drive the truckâ€and then buggering off and leaving you to work out how exactly you do that in the first placethat go way beyond the primal satisfaction that comes with driving a hulking great big rig For onethereâ€™s an incredibly calming sense of slow progression constantly burning away in the backgroundwith the sat-nav in the corner of your screen always slowly ticking down the miles left towards your destination Itâ€™s surprisingly satisfying to watch the numbers keep droppingand finally whittling a distance that seemed impossible to begin with down to nothingthere's the option to turn on your own music while drivingor even tune in to actual radio stations across Europe Set one of these up and hit the perfect momentwhere the right song comes on as you watch the sun slowly rise and peep through the treesand it all just feelsâ€¦ Right Hecktake my word for it when I say that having AC/DCâ€™s â€œHighway to Hellâ€ blasting out your speakers as youâ€™re racing down the road at max speed is something thatâ€™s hard to beat If youâ€™re daringyou can even pop a video or TV show up in another window and zone out But just like real lifethe chances of you suddenly finding yourself wrapped round the nearest streetlight rapidly increase if you do this Stillitâ€™s fun to try In the gamethat isand managing the two becomes a delicate balancing act of effective time managementwhere you are constantly checking out your route and seeing how far you can push yourself before you literally fall asleep at the wheel While it takes way too long if youâ€™re not wishing to put yourself in a position of extreme bank debt (so much so it actually gets a little frustrating)you can even make enough money to hire other truckers to your cause Suddenly youâ€™re busy plotting out an empiretrucks roaming across all of Europeand your hard work being rewarded with a skyrocketing bank account You can even make the core game more complicatedif youâ€™re that way inclined An automatic gearbox might be the obvious choicebut thereâ€™s nothing stopping you from having to switch through all the gears manuallyor even hooking a wheel up and going totally crazy The choiceas they sayis yoursthereâ€™s a lot you can bolt on to the base experience Whether it be branding the sides of trucks with famous logosor subtly changing the map and the way your truck handlesthereâ€™s a lot you can tinker about with if things are starting to feel a little dry Special shout out to the mod that lets you personalise the inside of your truck â€“ because thereâ€™s something irresistible about decking out your cabin with a giant BB-8 and a bunch of other nerdy bits and bobs that fill up every empty space While not offered in the game or mods themselves (and I can't say I tried this myself)thereâ€™s also means out there to take things onlinehitting the road with truckers all over the world Chances are youâ€™ll end up in a traffic jam trying to get a ferry to somewherebut heywhatever floats your boatwhatever you choose to do and however seriously you take whatâ€™s on offerEuro Truck Simulator 2 is perhaps the definite chilled out experience; with everything always just coming back down to you and the open road Itâ€™s the perfect game to unwind after a stressful daywhere the challenge or intensity of most other games simply doesn't appealand that's what makes it something so much more than something to laugh atWish I wrote this review years ago But being the hardcore gamer I amI decided to play the game instead XD""Why should I buy a truck gameIt's neither exciting nor does it have any story"" but as it was on saleI decided to buy the game and see for myselfgot used to the physicsmade myself some nice money and built a trucking empire Then I found out there were modsI used to spend hours playing and listening to the internet radios in the gameI made so many friends to this day I'm greatful that I played this gamePlease leave a commentlike it so people know that this game is worth buying all the dlcs for! (YesI bought every DLC they had)Upon a winter's night quite coldâ€œwhat a stupid gameâ€I'll cross that line!faith was rockeddocked and dropped my chargeâ€ said my girlfriendI knew I couldn't stopPoland and LuxembourgMuch like my sentiments of Farming Simulator 2013I fell in love with Euro Truck Simulator 2 and I have no idea why Mundane job simulators are overwhelmingly garbagebut a select few (including ETS2) are surprisingly compellingand are starting your own shipping company You have to drive according to the lawtake rest breaksbuy fuelpay for upkeep There is nothing on paper that should be exceptional about this gameyet for what it isEuro Truck Simulator 2 is disturbingly enjoyable I recommend everyone to give it a tryIt helps me cope with my depressionTop-notch truck driving simulator  With support for TrackIRwheels and pedalsthis game has become a gem of the simulation genreit's hard to see why this game will be so addicting  I suspect much of that feeling comes from the progression from a lowly truck driver not even owning a truck to a multi-country Logistics company owning a hundred trucks and employing as many driversobeying the road rules rather than smashing things up like a madman  That saidif you disable the speed-limiter in options (90kph) you can get a bit crazygetting as high as 150kph+ on some routesa bit of a thrill considering the cargo you have in tow!

You pick on what to do!and noyou hit a vehicle you'll just hit each other and no physical damage would be done between the collision If anythingyou'll just get a fine Speaking of finesthere are laws you have to follow Such as speedingRed Lights and Green Lights and so on The weather system is alright to my standards as you can change the settings of how often you want it to make it rain as you're on the road Gas and time is a big factor too It's important to keep track when you need to complete your delivery and keep your Fuel up at times! Sleep is also needed!but will get rid of that 'Simulation' Feel[/i]such as custom trucksmap modsGraphic Mods and more!you would have to try to find these mods somewhere off a ETS2 Mod Pagedefinitely I have the G29 Steering Wheel/Pedal/H Shifter includedit's so much better and very more immersivecombining it with the Wheel is awesomeI would very recommend pairing it up if you have VR or want to invest into it if your PC meets the requirementsbut half of them to me aren't worth getting Most of them are for Paintjobs for your trucks [i]Even though the Steam Workshop Supplies Free Paintjobs Without even Paying[/i]and only explored 6732% of the map!

maybe it's just driving on the other side of the road; or maybe I was expecting The Stig to cross my pathand even though as a fan of racing games I at first had doubts about this gameI gotta say if you have a wheel you really should try this game Everything about the game is pure pleasurebut the driving is not just enjoyable but challenging as well Things like parking your trailer; traveling swiftly but balancing your trailer's loads around all kinds of bendsinclines and declines; driving at night; dealing with other drivers (watch out for the evil empire of busses!) and trying to overtake slow pokes who follow the speed limit; traveling as fast as you can and watching for speeding cameras and changing speed limits make this one of the best driving games I've ever played Oh yeahdon't blow those red lights--all the tickets you could get for various things can really ad up on one tripI'm trying to make my trips even faster So I'm balancing my loads at top speedstaking the ever changing curves of the road as gracefully as possibleputting the pedal to the metal but watching for speed cameras and changing speed limits (watch out for those road hazard areas and be careful in town)and trying to overtake just like in a racing game--but it's more challenging with opposing traffic on busy highways!which has a great interface and features but is very low resource)and I am looking forward to American Truck SimulatorThere's nothing better than sitting in traffic for 2 hours when commuting home during rush hourthen sitting in virtual traffic for another 2 hoursIt's very hard to hype this game up You get into a truck with some cargo to deliver and hit the road accross a scaled down version of Europe Over time you gain experience for thingslike longer distancesmore valuable cargoetc You can eventually buy your own truck(s)hire other drivers and expand your trucking empire and stuffit's about driving heavysluggish trucks I am having difficulties putting into words [i]why[/i] any of this is fun Perhaps fun isn't the right word at allsatisfyingand sometimes tenseit rained for a whileor got really dark Or both The moment where you missed your exit somewhere in belgium The moment where you discovered you could listen to actual internet radio from within your truckfrom a station that matches the country you're gently passing throughbut if you're anything like meyou'll keep coming back to itrunning a delivery once in a whilebecause it's relaxingand the moments are tantalizingthere's a multiplayer mod It's all of this except once in a while you will pass another guy going in the opposite direction You'll both cheerfully honk your horns in greetingthen continue on your respective ways I guess that's also another momentbut my deepest secret about it is that I am [i]really looking forward to playing ETS2 when the consumer version lands[/i] Seriously That's how much I enjoy this gameI hate my Job ATM  So I come home and I'm my own Boss  I own my Truck and TrailerI even employ some crazy looking geezer who barely makes a profitbut I respect him and treat him better than I'm treated IRLbut this game is amazingI love it  Highly recommend you to at least try itI like the game as it isalthough one thing irritates meand that is the fact that you cannot buy used/older trucks So it would be nice to see a second-hand shop where you could buy older and used trucks from like early 2000's or maybe even older onesThis would affect the price and condition so it could make driving less ""easy""and by doing so it would add more content to the game Thus you wouldn't have to buy a brand new truck every time if you want it to be your ownI like to get an audio bookput it in the right folderand listen to it while I'm trucking Makes the experience a whole lot more satisfying I'd advise everyone to at least try the sameThis is the best Driving Simulator that i have come across The details are greatthe drivingironing out the little bugs that come upWe recently had our first child and I was looking for a relaxing game to play during my (limited) downtime Well I found it Cruising around Europesoaking in the scenery while listening to some random french jazz radio station playing in my truck literally puts a smile on my face It's also very effective as an excuse for more playing time ""I'm just 25 km from finishing my tomato delivery to Venice"" is a lot harder to argue with than ""I just need to kill these last few guys"""
1,"I meanwhat's there to say It's Dark Soulsbut not as godawfully hard as the internet likes to proclaim it as if you diejust get back up try again Use your head Be smarter than them You've got

sunthe tutorial is a boss fightIt's like all those anime with overpowered protagonistsA week ago I was diagnosed with a terminal illnes and the doctors have given me a year at best I'm so glad I was able to play again this masterpiece before I go I don't know how many people will see this; but I recomend to you to buy this game if you do see it Gameplayboss fightsongslorepvp everything is masterfully crafted Thank you Hidetaka Miyazaki and FromSoftware for yours game I wish I can play Elden Ring before I goI summoned a mad phantom with the intention of dueling himbut instead he sat down and offered to toast with me We continued on throughout Undead Settlement together despite my wariness of him and he helped me take out all the mobs in the surrounding area After a whileI became accustomed to fighting alongside my newfound friend and started turning my back to him knowing full well that he would protect me to his lastdying breathand nothing could stand in our way He may not have been a Warrior of Sunlightbut Solaire's legacy thrived on within him Jolly co-operation resumed until we neared the Curse-Rotted Greatwood  And it was then that I decided to take yet another chance and summon a second Mound-Maker to see if we could rally him to our sideand his interest in my backside became a significant concern My anxiety was proven justified when the phantom took a swing at me with his greatsword and missedbefore charging forward with fury the likes of which none in Lothric had seen He made it his personal duty to end the traitorous life of the one who would dare attempt to strike at meand before long the violent fool was fleeing from our jolly wrath He rushed up a ladder and leaped across rooftops before finally dropping a harmful distance to the groundgiving us an opening to attack My companion launched himself from the rafters and his flowing cape waved majestically in the air as he readied his sword and plunged towards the infidel who would dare spit on the tenets of co-operation and sunlightthe weapon grinding through bone and flesh and rendering him a lifeless husk I dropped down following thisand we waved and spun our capes at one another in excitement and victorious gleeGreat game aheadTough but fair Rewards slow and methodical gameplay And the boss battles are fantasticElden Ring waiting lobbythis game wouldn't exist without Kentaro Miura Rest in peace senseiI was in a very dark place in my lifefull of depression and anxiety Then i downloaded and started playing Dark Souls 3  My life totally changed and I'm in a much darker place nowAfter putting these many hoursI must say that this is one of the bestif not THE best RPG Periodyes It has a steep learning curvealso yes But this game is a rare gem among the simplifiedstraight-forwardlinear games that are currently in trend Rare indeed for a game that actually rewards you for patience and restraint and encourages players to slow down and observe the surroundings and the enemiesthe same can be said about Dark Souls 1 and 2 But Dark Souls 3 is really much more refined than those in a good way Relatively faster paced combat not only feels more fresh but I think is a necessary step forward in making the gameplay more interesting Alsothe enemies are much more aggressive to compensate for this faster paced combatwhich I personally believe to be the best in the Souls series But it is still well above Dark Souls 2which I personally didn't like all that wellbut for brevity I must say: Everyone must try this at least oncehardest thing so far was holding back the tears after realizing you bought the game one day before a 75% saleFinally beat the first bossseams like a pretty cool game so farThis game is so addictive that it makes you buy itself on another platformsGive us Demon Souls Remastered and Bloodborne PCBest dating simulator everThere isnt any game that will make me feel as connected to my character as much as the Soulsborne Series has But specificallyDark souls 1-3ive easily played this 3-4x more than the playtime suggests (I also own it on PS4)it might not be the best game the bosses not as hard as some but i made a character and that character i have never had a better representation of my self in any game and ill explain whyI remember putting the game on my PC and dealing with the buggy Microsoft Windows Platform but i kept goingI made my character look like me like i always do after the back tingling sensation the opening cut scene gave me The witches of izalith with thier chaotic flameGwyn smiting the dragonsNito moving with his wrathful stanceWith his Dark Soul Sharing it with others HumanityBuggy controls or not i had funNot just playing the game but reading desciptions of items trying to scrounge up what the lore ment and filling in the gaps that i missed I wanted more and morethe story was great even if it wasnt offered up straight to you and you had to look for itand i think thats probably why it was greatGrowing up he had a lot of time alone and he spent it readingHe loved it but his favorite books were those about the knight who goes on daring quests to save a princess or slay a dragon and find treasureHowever these books were in english and so he didnt understand them completelya lot of the information was missing and he filled in the blanks with his day dreams of how HE wanted the story to go imagining the hardships the knight must have gone through to get to where he wasand he couldnt have done it in a better way than what he did with dark soulsHe made a community of people who feverishly try to fill in the blanks of the story even so complex that it makes your head spinMaking it a continuation of my characters story -its my favorite ending and if i have the option its the one i always take so to me the story of drangleic was someone else managed to get through and continue the age of fire while i went off and disappeared for an undisclosed amount of time with a dope hat and a ton of souls[/spoiler]the controls were more optimized so the game itself didnt seem as hard and the opening cutscene was greati got goosebumps when the old firekeeper said ""And like a moth to the flame your wings will burn in anguishTime and Time again"" and that was very true to the game we kept going for more even though you would get that angry sensation to just put it down and not pick it up but you always doa perfect continuation of the story from the firstprobably due to Miyazaki having more influence on this game and not being distracted with a different project (Bloodborne if i recall) and it continued the story for me perfectlyfrom beginning to end Dark Souls 3 has made me feel like a bad assI always ALWAYS start Deprived (recommend it to everyone even if you're just starting) because i enjoy the feeling of starting from scratch and tearing my way through challenges to distract me from my challenges in lifei enjoy the struggle and Dark souls 3 Gave me a good fight but like every challenge its there to be completed and with the release of The Ringed City and Dark Souls 3 : The Fire Fades  Edition the series will sadly be put to rest and to me it will go down in my history as the game that pulled me through depression because even though its hard when i felt like i couldnt accomplish anything in my life the Dark Souls franchise showed me that if i kept trying eventually i could pull throughI just finished collecting everything from The Ringed CityI killed Dark Eater Midir After a struggle and i gave the Blood of the Dark Soul to the Painting Girl She is naming the Painted world after me in this burning chapel of forlorn souls the final road in my journey through Dark souls I have slain Demons and Dragons and Men I Conquered Gods and Giants And ive arisen from the ashes to Usurp the flame a final time And now it all burns away The age of Fire might fade But the age of men begins in a cold dark and gentle place[/spoiler]For the DLC For the adventures and the times i spent jolly co-operating For helping me pull through For the Fantasy of Struggle Thank youi also editted it a bit so the Spoilers wouldnt be visible unless you hovered over them im sorry to the people who read them before i decided to use my brain and format it properly[/spoiler]Step 1: Buy Dark Souls III never having played a Dark Souls game beforeSome people saythat Midir is the hardest bossbut the naked guy who invaded and killed me 20 times in a row thinks otherwiseIt finally clicked Now I get why the Dark Souls series has such an activeenthusiasticand [i]borderline[/i] [b]obsessed[/b] community Although I was hesitant to start [b]Dark Souls 3[/b]I can now say that it is one of the greatest gaming experiences I have hadyou often get disoriented as you progress (especially during the first playthrough) At a certain pointyou come across unlockable door(s) or elevator(s) that connects to a previous area and acts as a shortcut The sudden realization that you went around in one big circle or that youâ€™re directly above/below a previous area always left me baffled I really wonder how much time was put into the level designIâ€™ve barely skimmed the surface when it comes to combat but it is enough for me to recognize how incredible it is There are so many weaponsmovesetsspellsinfusionsand more Plus the combinations you can put together are only limited by your imagination (for the most part) There is a reason why several people spend hours putting together the perfect PVP character(s)there are itemsNPCsand interesting rooms hidden everywhere Itâ€™s gotten so bad that I feel paranoid when I reach a pointless dead end and find nothing - â€œthere HAS to be something hereâ€ Finding a secret felt like finding candy on a scavenger hunt and was thrilling from beginning to end Keep a look out for fake wallssuspicious ledgespotential jumpsand chests [i]Beware of mimics though[/i]and to include a safe hub (Firelink Shrine)where most of the important NPCs/vendors can be found This made Dark Souls 3 more user-friendly (especially for beginners) than Dark Souls 1 Although this made Dark Souls 3 more linnearI found the clarity of knowing more or less what to do and where to go (also being able to teleport back in case you went the â€œwrongâ€ way) more enjoyable than the uncertainty I felt when playing the first Dark Soulsinter-player interactions play a large role in the Dark Souls series You can leave notes (to either help or trick others)you can summon other players for a co-op experienceand you can invade other peopleâ€™s worlds for PVP I think this is another reason why the Dark Souls community holds strong - despite being portrayed as a single player gameyou are rarely alone I found that the online features (co-op and PVP) worked very well most of the time Naturallythere are some instances of lag or disconnectionbut it is very easy to set up again Initially I hated being invadedbut Iâ€™ve learned to love it for two reasons:victories are so damn sweetI knowbut it adds near-infinite extra hours of excitement and replayability to Dark Souls 3I still find that Dark Souls 3 is not very beginner friendly More specificallyI had to look up some basic guides before starting the game to understand which stats do whatand what sort of build I should go for A lot of informationfor example stat soft-capsis not particularly clear to begin with I find that this steep learning curvein addition to Dark Soulsâ€™ notoriety for being difficultpushes a lot of beginners away On the other handthe Dark Souls series has come a long way3 being the most user-friendly and clear game in my experience After playing itI realized that I could have easily learned how to build my character through a little trial and error Grantedmy character would not be perfectbut like many veterans say: â€œno point in Vigor is wastedâ€ Dark Souls is the kind of game that expects you to pour countless hours in to before you â€œgit gudâ€such that a veteran with awful equipment will almost always beat a beginner with God-tier equipment It should be emphasized that [b]YOU ARE EXPECTED TO MAKE MISTAKES[/b]; the complexity of Dark Souls 3 is exactly what makes it so spectacularbut it has quickly become one of the greatest gaming experiences Iâ€™ve ever had If you are on the fenceI urge you to give Dark Souls 3 a try Be patientlearn from your mistakesand donâ€™t give up - only then will you prosper and praise the sunI honestly believe that the death/learn-from-your-mistakes system is the number one selling point of the whole series"
1,"[h1]Whether you want to be a vigilantea pig killeror you just want to drive your motor around and using walking civilians as a rampNight City has it all...[/h1]2021 after the 1.31 patch[/i]did it? But for the biggest partits all fixed now.but in most cases they are just visual.you know? You somewhat hate some of your relatives but you still love them in another wayright? Well thats CP2077 for me.in the future when we will have implants real lifethe entire world will be buggy and glitchy. This game is just immersive![/i]and i would sayi am very happy i didnt give up on it.as far as bugs goits pretty stable and i didnt really encounter anything that was major.people are different so this is purely my opinionbut i dont like how the car driving feels in this gameit feels too.. stiff and unnaturalit might be just me because i am used to old-school car drivinglets say GTA 3/NFS (anything before NFS 5 - Porsche).its what i use most of the times.the waypointing system is somewhat badthe routes you get arent the most efficient onesand often your objective isnt appearing on the floor it really isso you end up searching for something and then realize it might be in some hidden basement or something.or maybe i am just getting oldbut i feel like theres no point in over-complicating things.but its fine by methe game compensates with other stuff.and this probably was my biggest oof about the game was that the assault rifles are pretty awful.but the assault rifles are just bad and inefficient. Even shotguns are decent.theyre the pillar of this gamethe ultimate moneyshot.you will feel so small.Its quite an interesting feeling that i could never get from any game beforefor me this thing made the game so much more immersive.amazing world details and suchbut the size of it alltoo.alleysnot to mention if you go climbing like a goat on all the buildings.if youre into walking simulatorsthis alone could be worth your eddies (i.e. money).it avoids some of the most boring clichesalthoughits not anything mindblowing.depending on how you make your decisionsi think its pretty rare to actually feel like your decisions really affect people in games. To feel like youre actually influence someone real.cmonthis dude is a decent fellai shouldnt be a dick to himand welli usually dont overthink that kind of stuff in a gamelol.the internet is full of tutorials and contentthey arent very finicky to installhoweverupdates usually tend to mess with them.but also random events happening around as you walksuch as groups of gang members commiting dumb stuff. Obviously you can go past thembut would you? After this game will suck you inyou wont be able to stop sinking hours in it.my advice would be to not rush into the story (I kinda did and i am not very happy about it)and enjoy some of these side stuff firstbesides leveling up and getting cool stuff which will aid you in the main missions laterits also the best way to get to know the game.some subtlesome not so subtleespecially if youre from Eastern Europe.non-lethal and stealthyor you can go in guns blazingand not leave one single cell in an enemys body alive. Of coursea combination between all of these options is also a possibilitybut i like to keep it simple.i can and do appreciate a game with good stealth. CP2077 doesnt have a good nor bad stealthits just.. averagei guess?i mean purely by how it feels for me to play it in stealth. You do get to be very creative in stealthyou have interesting ways to mess with the enemies and distract thembut the satisfaction just isnt there for me)its a game that will suck you inyou will have fun for hoursthe world is purely amazingyoull feel like Woah all the time.i was angry about the delaysbefore i got the chance to play it at the releasemy PC died. Now after 1 year i finally get to play it (I know its better that i didnt play it at launchbut its about the principle).and for the price i paid (one night out in the city [spoiler]I might have an alcohol problem though[/spoiler])i had and still have a lot of funeven if i already saw 2 endingsi am not letting my grip of iti dont even remember when i was so caught in a game that i played it without a break until the sun was rising.and theres still plenty of juice in this baby.but theyre people and they make mistakesand they werent lazy. I would say things went wrong because of the team leading/resource managementbut thats another subject and quite irrelevant.and they fixed a majority of issuesand they still are working on the game.but it is what it isi cant say i am not disappointed because its not how i expected the game to be after how it was marketed pre-releasebut i also like to believe i have some common sense and ability to make the best out of situations.for Vigilantismfor Vanityfor [spoiler]Virility[/spoiler]. It stands for anything your heart VVants.[/b][/i]Everyone complained about the bugs and glitches but the real problems are that the games systems are terribly outdated. People were promised a next-gen experience. Ive played games from a decade ago that have better open worlds then this.theyll just stop and sit there for eternity.or sit and enjoy a virtual drink (unless its a talking-scene tied to a quest).NomadCorpo) have little to no affect beyond the first 20 minutes of the game and simple dialogue changes.shapeor form.liveriesor body-pieces.shooting-rangeboxingand car racing. There are only two shooting-range questsonly 6 boxing matchesand only 4 races. Thats it as far as mini-games go.I cant recommend this game to anyone.[h1]DOWNLOAD THE NVIDIA GAME READY DRIVERS FOR THE LOVE OF GOD[/h1]update your nvidia drivers.while I have not finished it I feel I have experienced enough of the core mechanics to formulate an accurate opinion at least on the gameplay.considering that Witcher 3 was amazing (and I still have yet to get through it entirely) it does translate. Narratively this game excelsthe dialogue is well written and acted and the characters are hard to not fall in love with. Walking around the world is exhilarating although unengagingit is lacking interactivity. That being said the gameplay itself is a lot of fun. The guns pack a huge punchvery satisfying to use. The melee with katanas specifically is fun but brokenI did a body and reflex melee build and was able to behead TONS of foes before they even had time to react. The game is unfortunately plagued with bugsless severe bugs especially after the recent hotfix but there are a myriad of small immersion raping bugs that pop up here and there Bethesda style.the graphics are important but less so. The decision-making of Witcher is here and thats really what I like the most HOWEVER this game was clearly not ready and considering recent events with the dev I will be hard pressed to trust them again. This is an incredibly bad launch.if youre the type that is a fan of Deus ExDishonoredor Fallout: New Vegas you will love this game warts and all just for the godlike quest design those and this game offer. Plenty of skill check dialogue to be found. Suffice to say that I have had a good amount of ""That actually worked?!?"" moments so far which is a really hard feeling to nail down with games like thisyou usually only get that out of CRPGs like Age of Decadence or Divinityetc. At the same time I do not judge anyone that refunds this game or waits for a more stable version to come out because CD PROJEKT RED really dropped the ball and should not have released the game in this state.this game is mostly what I expected it to be and it is a shame that people expected this game to be the second coming of Jesus. I was banking on the decision making and quest design and this game delivers on those fronts. Everything else thoughit does fail here and there butin my opinionnot enough to make the game genuinely bad. If I had to give it a score out of ten it would be a solid 8/10. Hopefully CD PROJEKT RED can iron out all of these problems in a timely manner and elevate its standing.it depends on what youre driving but in my opinion it should just be the same for whatever youre driving but Im just talking out of my ass at this point.Although its buggy and feels poorly optimizedI still sunk 40 hours into the game just doing side missions without even trying. The game has its issues surebut the game itself certainly is something special worth at the bare minimum open mindedness that CDPR will address the issues in a timely manneras they did for The Witcher 3 on release as well. Remember Roach the roof horse?So I am over 60 years old and fairly new to gaming in general. Jumping from World of Warships (fairly new at that also) to this gives you an idea. Before this it had been many years since playing ANY games. SoI am floored by this game. To me its amazing. Now I set the combat at an easy level and I bumble around in here and am in no hurry. I explore around sometimes doing nothing but looking around. I have gone through a fair amount of the story line - again - its all amazing to me. In short I love it. I now am branching to more gamesas I find I enjoy playing more then one game at a time. I love the characters of this gamethe visuals of itand have no complaints. Occasionally I run across a very minor glitch of getting stuck or somethingbut this does not bother me. I do not expect perfection. But I want to emphasize this is very rare. Well done to the developers of this game.if you have an RTX card turn on DLSS. helps out performance a lot :)I love this game but games needs to be optimized and fix glitches[h1] Great game but it needs polishing.[/h1]for everyone who are still willing to buy it I will definitely advise to wait a bit. Trust meI am not the one who scares everyone awayon the contrarythe [u]game is great[/u] and worth buying it! [u]BUT[/u] everyone who knows the situation will agree that [u]it needs polishing.[/u] Its sadthat thanks to some peopledevelopers had to publish this game earlier. I wouldnt be offended if they took more timelike VALVE did with Half-life Alyx.[h1]Just remember:[/h1]*Spoiler free*ive done a 100% corpo playthrough on very hard as well as a melee run on normal sprinting thru to obtain the secret ending.multiple friends and I have had majorly different outcomes playing the same class in the same style/build as well as found tertiary outcomes in subsequent playthroughs. Cant stress how good this aspect is enough.the side content is easily double if not triple that. Between cyberpsychos/gigs/police/side kick story quests/flavor text quests it can actually be quite overwhelming when you begin the game. For the full experience I highly recommend completing all of the sidekick story quests as they give the opportunity to experience the most endings as well as inject the most girth into the primary story. Easily the highlight of the game. This is obvious when comparing my two playthroughsin the 100% one I had a complete feeling of understanding. the directions things were going were carried by these side questsall of the motivations and history are there. In my rushed playthroughit simply felt like a series of conversations with johnny silverhand and taking turns swapping bodies. completely different experiences. I just felt like I was rushing around doing errands for johnny by pushing only the main story.despite the ""crowd AI not being amazing. Yesdespite there not being ""1k+ routines."" YesI played RDR2 and GTAV and yada yada yada. Night City is alive and you can hear it breathing. This is amplified 10x when you acquire the double jump or rocket jump legs. The verticality they promised was delivered in spades. EVERYTHING is climbable. Give it a shot. Look around.its the same song and dance. Massive amounts of useless scaled loot where everywhere you look you see slight 1% dps upgrades to already existing items. Add onto that you have a weight/stash system and it just becomes a chore by the end game. If you are a packrat like meinvest into the body perk for 60 extra carrying capacity for peace of mind. The exception to this con are the ""iconic weapons that are unlocked after completing certain criteria. Unique and usefulI found ""skippy"" to be the best weapon in the entire game. Look out for him and the other icons :)rushed. Sad. One of my most anticipated features.melee is in a rough spot. Dont take this to mean that melee is more difficultit simply means that the AI is so bad that they clump up and spin in circles or glitch through walls to 1 shot you with a shotgun and you will end up getting gangbanged every time. Cop AI is....missing. If you commit a crime and get 4 stars just let them kill you or drive away far enoughthey will simply give up. There are no correction routines for driving AI. Simply park your car on the road to create an infinite traffic jam.No crash reactions. No crash animations. You can hit a wall at 200 mph and be fine. They make no attempts to course correct or avoid collisionsame with the crowd AI. If you double jump in public people will just...huddle near you..scared for their life? AgainAI feels missing.based on the ""gender"" you chose at the beginning of the game. So if you went in with ideas of who you wanted to fuckyou may be very dissapointed (if you care at all.)this is one of the most enjoyable RPGs ive played in my life. The amount of variables you have to play with in the beautiful world of night city is actually crazy. When I read reviewers saying that they hated johnny silverhand because he was an asshole or that they didnt really understand the story and that it all felt rushedI feel bad. Or I read on reddit that the game was too buggy to enjoy and there were too many dropped/cut features to be a ""good game""I feel bad. We played different games. I got an 80-100 hour open world RPG set in a cyberpunk universe with characters that had personalitya story that had me wondering about the possibilities so much that I immediately started a second playthrough. A city that was handcrafted top to bottom with views so nice I was constantly snapshotting and posting them on discord. A soundtrack that had me wanting to sit in cars to finish tracks. I got a game that I am disappointed having finished.Choom.*NO SPOILERS*I have been holding off reviewing it for a while.nor the deceitful behavior from CDPR throughout the development and release. Just the game itselfthe gameplay and  the mechanics.I was never part of any hype train and only paid attention to what CDPR specifically said the game would be.why that â€œheaderâ€? [/b]the point still persist.but they still got it wrong.and not like this?â€â€œIt would have been better ifâ€¦â€â€œIt would have made a lot more sense if.â€whatâ€™s good about this game?

Stunning.the look of the citythe open world in generalthe loremost of the storythe battle/gun systemthe great side quests that often more than rivals a lot of what the main story have to offerthe perk system and the ability to equip Cyberware.and mostly subjective of course.the game has been cut to pieces/heavily watered down from the original vision/marketing.day and night cyclesthe metroweather impacting the gameimportant life path selection (it doesnâ€™t matter at all)crowd community systemthird person cutscenesthe AI etc. etc.but instead it is groundbreakingly bad.no interactionsno heartno factions you can play into for depthno nothing.they were supposed to feel alive and part of the game.no real wanted system. You see them from time to time on street cornersalmost T-posing.they just always annoy you if you aim your gun in public or hit a pedestrian etc. and they then almost always WILL become aggro to you. If you did the deed on the top of a mountaina cop probably saw it somehow.they ignore you beforeduring and after the fact.they only just recently patched that cops would spawn right behind you no matter where you were at the time (in the weeds or on top of a building).feels very unreal as Iâ€™ve been saying. There is a lot to dobut it has absolutely NO effect on anything at all. It doesnâ€™t impact youthe game or the AI.â€œCrimesâ€ etc. are just random no effect happenings - plus loot.against the virtual world in which you are imprisoned. And with that I mean that it feels like you are in a virtual world - in game.by any means. Just really disappointing.is that itâ€™s finite. Itâ€™s closed off.

And then making them even better for this gen?and that CDPR wants to take Cyberpunk Online at some point.I actually enjoyed playing. I mean I have 100+ hours in it! Right?itâ€™s complicated...improved on etc. so the gameplay would be better. I wanted to save the main story for that. SoI spent my time hunting lootgrinding etc.the main story can still endcredits and allwithout it ""forcing"" you to stop playing or only being able to go back to before the end.but you will feel hollow and regretful later.gameplay mechanics etc. will probably not see any action before a good while (if ever).im a clown for pre ordering thisEveryone is focusing on the code bugs and graphical glitchesand there are so many of those for every platform.  But even if we strip away all those technical issuesthis game is just plain incomplete.but actually loses you your knife after a single throwwhich totally destroys any point to having such a perk/strategy.  In the endit makes every battle feel pretty much the samedespite intense attempt to build a character that goes counter to it.but is that what perks should be doing in a game?  Fix the chore itselfinstead of making it a reward to not have to do it.  Interestinglythere are paradoxes to getting rid of this tediumsince scrapping certain junk actually removes economic opportunities for the player too (some junk is worth way more than the scrap it creates).theyre just pretty environment geometry.  Most of the game is like thisdespite such a beautiful citythere really isnt much to do in the city besides travel through it and shoot things.  No sportsno bar gamesnothing.which is both unrealistic and cheap.  But even thenon Very Hardyou can easily escape any wanted level by sprinting down the road in a straight line.  The cops cant keep up and they wont put any backup in front of you.  Alsojumping in any body of water will confuse the police enough to lose all levels.  For a game that came out seven years after GTA V and thirteen years after GTA SAthis is comically unacceptable.  I hate when people blame QA for game issuesbut the AI honestly makes me wonder if CDPR even tried playing this game naturallyor perhaps if their warnings about the gameplay were ignored altogether.but thats about the only compliment I can give this game and it just further exposes the fact that the city is pretty void of things to do.  And when looking at all the tall buildings seemingly connected by a network of high rise tunnels and bridgesit only serves as a tease since the game has no real vertical element.  No flyingno climbingno parachuting or repelling.its just not good.  It has a lot of sizzlebut no steak.  I love the setting of this gameand I love The Witcherand I loved the way this company operated in general.  I had expected this game to revolutionize the open world RPGbut instead we got a mess so badI cant even understand how it got released with a straight face (even putting code bugs aside).   It doesnt justify the $60 purchase price for meand it doesnt hold a candle to many open world games that came out ten to fifteen years ago.  This may not be the worst game in historybut its easily the most disappointing game Ive ever played.  I hope CDPR gets its act togetherbecause this game is not good.I have been thinking of writing a review for this game for a long time. I love Cyberpunk 2077I still play it and will continue to play it as new content comes outbut as of writing this review (June 17th2021v.1.22) I cannot recommend it as a whole experience with clear conscience. I will update the review once something changes.but they did not address the issues I mention.I love the gameand I do love it for a lot of thingsbut the most important one is [i]potential[/i]. The game has potential to be greatone of the greatest games in the genrebut its not fulfilling it at the moment. For nowI see it as a skeleton of a game that it can bebut the core elements that are there are very strong. These elements are the main story and side storylinesworld building and auxiliary storytellingcharacterssettingthe aesthetic and visual designgameplaymusic (both in-radio and ambient soundtrack)the list could go on.sure enough they arent goodbut 1. I believe the game has much bigger problemsand 2. I believe those will get ironed out with timewith each new update.and that term encompasses a large area of the gameso Im going to point some of them out and what I think would be a better alternative.the character creator is quite expansivebut customization extends to more things than just Vs physical appearance. We are talking gunscars and bikesapartmentshaircuts and tattooscyberwareetc.they have no purposeno routinesjust occupying screen space. They spawn and despawn as you turn aroundturn around and start walking in opposite direction when theres something in their wayreact unrealistically to traffic or gunfire. Traffic NPC AI is even worsethey wont go around any obstacleno matter how slightsometimes just plain stop in the middle of the road for no reasonswerve around lanesnot react properly to traffic lightsit goes on.but there should be people you can talk to that arent part of a quest in some way.and these corporations produce things. Mostly arms. And if you look around the cityyou can see they have their branded stores. I think that it would be great for immersion if these stores were functional and stocked with weaponry manufactured by that corporation (for example corp A produces power rifles and body armorcorp B has flamethrowerslight machine gunsand grenade launcherscorp C specializes in bladeshas all the katanaskukrisknivesaxesetc.) and you need to visit a specific manufacturers store to pick up a specific weapon type. You should be able to customize your gun when purchasinglike changing the skin and getting attachments. And on the counter side of the corpo stores would be street markets where you can buy pre-owned ironmaybe it already has a scope on itor some paint and stickers. Its probably not as a good as a brand new toybut at least its not sold at a 3000% markup.alongside the price and street cred requirement. It was implied that different implants have different humanity coststhe greater the modificationthe greater the cost (for examplea low-key Kiroshi eyeball implant would have a significantly lower humanity cost than a Maelstrom-like visor replacing half of your facebut would also not offer as much utility). We dont know how having high and low humanity cost would affect the gamebut I pictured it to be a nuanced and interesting system.its that they barely change your appearance. The only mods that change your look are arms and hands mods. We should be given a lot more options of heavy body modifications.you just open the shopping windowbuy the implant and youre good to go. There should be an animation every time you get an implant installedsimilar to the first scene at Viks.the corporate stores dont make that much sense here like they do with the guns. Since ripperdocs are running their independent clinicsthey can stock with whatever they want (or whatever they can get). There should be top-of-the-line clinics with bestbrand-new implantsand scroungier chop-shops where maybe its a bit more mix-and-match (like a cyber arm put together from different parts) but itll get the job done.there was a lot of teasing going on. One of the teasers were snaps of Night City fashion and the 4 main dressing styles prevalent in the citywhich indicated that your choice of clothes is important in the city of dreams. Meanwhileclothing selection is pretty limitedand clothes serve simply as armor. I would have much rather have armor stat be boosted only by either wearing actual body armor or by installing implants like subdermal armor and shock absorbersand have clothing be purely cosmetic.barsrestaurants and food standsracesfistfightsBDs...side questsgigsand hustles. Action 100% of the time. There need to be activities to do in down time. You should be able to go to a bargrab a seat and have a drinkgo to a club and dance the night awayvisit a restaurant and have a nice meal at a table or go to food stand to grab a bite on the go. Its the little things that add up to a greater whole. When playing for the first timeI remember reading all the websites on the Netand being impressed with how complex the city isand wondering which of the coveted clubs Ill visit first when I get the chance.mostly inconsequentialdialogue options throughout the game)as well as the life path intro part should be longer to really get a feel for what life was like for V before becoming a mercenary (at least a few missions). Alsothere should be more gigs with Jackie before we do the Heistto bond with the character more.once the thread is over you can barely interact with your S/Omaybe youll get some texts from thembut thats about it. There should be something more you can do with them after youve done their quests.because it doesnt feel like theres anything to discover - the city is reminiscent of its citizenslooks goodbut is empty on the inside.as of right nowevery event in the game world is pre-scripted.my review of Cyberpunk 2077. Like I saidI was thinking about it for a while so theres a good chance Im forgetting something else I wanted to mention.I said all I had to say so you can judge for yourselfbut if I were youId wait for the first drop of new content before deciding.I bought this game on sale for $70 AUDand I had bought in to any hype or watched any trailers. I watched a couple reviewsand bought this at a sale price to see what the fuss was about.but I wont be playing it again. Please let me explain why I still recommend this.corpo infested city that is alive with things to do. The montage of you and Jackie plays out in hot spots around Night Citydancingdrinkinghaving a sick time. You fly in an AVyou take on the biggest Corporation in night city with the hopes of becoming legends.get drunk and stumble aroundfuck around with the Privatisedcorrupt NCPD (more on that later)watch brain dancesgo to clubs and danceits just a map that exists for you to drive through.they dont respond to anything (Patch 1.22-1.23). The traffic is still useless and have no mind of their own. I parked my car on the road and it just caused a massive line up of cars just sitting there waiting.when I can just steal a car to do that for me? Or just fast travel?advertised as corruptnasty power abusing thugs do NOTHING. And if you do run into themthey will spawn IN FRONT OF YOU and blast you to pieces. Theres no bribingno arrestsno dirty cops asking you to do jobs for them. They dont even drive around. Its a SERIOUSLY missed opportunity considering the amount of NPCD side gigs you can do.get a warranta cop tries to arrest you. You could either pay your way out or do a job for him. This could be linked to any of the NPCD gigs in the city. But theyre not. The cops do not play a massive part in the world and its seriously best if you ignore them completely. Because they always ignore you. When they dont ignore youits a broken mess that is pointless and adds nothing to the gameplay.and youre right. But this game sets the expectation that Night City is your playgroundand its a city that is alive and can be lived in. Its not. Its just a map to do shit in.but for others the beauty of the cyberpunk city may be enough to keep them interested. HoweverI really doubt it.firearmshackingand stealth. I found myself using stealth and quick hacks a lotand relying heavily of Tech weapons to do serious damage to people.breaking peoples necksdumping the bodieshacking security cameras and turrets to work in your favour were some of the best times in combat.the AI were either super smart or super dumb dumband once I found a Power Rifle all encounters were so damn easy it was a cakewalk from then on out. I played on the hard difficulty for reference.and the combat for me was overall acceptable.but you dont see your character enough anyway so dont worry too much about it.namely the clothingall look fuckin absurd. By the end of the game you will be wearing so much mismatched nonsense for the sake of armour and clothing mods.REALLY stupid.all of it is for saving your life. No one wants to help you unless you can do something for them. Kill some other gang membersteal some shitkill some other dude. Find out that the person you did all this for cant help youor they just die anyway. Your character becomes desperate and by the end of the main story youre either making a deal with a corpo devilor going out in a blaze of glory.and Ill explain below.he seems pretty reasonableand you go to investigate a break in of their home.antennas and cables leading to the roofand then you spot a van outside the building.you end up a huge firefight. Once you waste themyou hack the van and find out that these group of hackers are literally changing Peralezs mind.his personalitythey are changing him completely so when he gets elected mayor his decisions will favour these hackers intentions. A crazydystopian nightmare of mind altering control.Elizabeth was aware of it. She had no choice but to go on with itto not tell him what was going on.to either explain to him to situation or give him no clues.you are contacted by the hackers. They blacken your visionand warn you to stay out of it.the rebellious anti corpo blaze of glory bad ass warns you to stay out of this one. Its too risky. I wanted to find these guys. These hackers who are controlling a politicians brainsome crazy cyberpunk shit that made my skin crawl.you receive a few text messagesand thats it. Mission over. You never hear from them again.so damn close to being a fantastic missionbut they all just scrape the surface of something with the potential to be MUCH bigger.but it never happens.Im disappointed that this was ALL it had to offer.the lack of world developmentThe main missions that end SUPER quicklyor the side missions that burn out right before they get really good.glittered in a cyberpunk aesthetic.Best Early Access game ever... cant wait for the final build!EDIT: Completed the game after 65 hoursnot nearly as packed as Witcher 3 but every minute just as enjoyable. The main quest gave me the point of no return pretty quicklyso I avoided that and completed just about everything else on offer firstaside from boxingcollectablesout of the way gigsand police shootoutswhich felt like filler. Most of the main content is very well done and found only a few instances of medium-strength bugs that lessened the experience. Some of it is nearly brilliant.so I cant tell if some of the anger over this game came from broken promisesbut this is exactly the game I hoped it would be and it exceeded my expectations. Played on a modest system at lower settings to keep a decent framerate and the graphics are incredibleworld is amazingcity is layered and complexand detail shows in every dark corner. It doesnt have the interactivity of a GTA title; you cant take your fake girlfriend bowling or get a haircutbut I never cared for that stuff anyway. The mission designsettingand writing matter to meand Cyberpunk delivers through nearly the whole running time.and that it gets fixed up quickly for anyone unable to give this a try. I can easily see that the game isnt for everyone but you if you ever liked a Deus Ex then give this a shot.which are medium. Even with these low settings the graphic quality is really good and keeps framerate ranges in 50-60with a few drops in some outdoors sections. This is very playable. No crashes or game-breaking glitches for me so farthough there have been oddities that required a game restart.and hits exactly what I was hoping for. The shooting is well above averagecar handling not so good (hopefully these get some changes)RPG systems seem plenty deep enoughand the conversation trees are mostly great. Dont feel like Im far enough in yet to judge "
1,"I held off on reviewing until I got much further into the game since most other reviewers only have a few hours. I had 150+ hours in beta but the game has changed a lot since.truly a massive game. Can expect 100+ hours of content on a single playthrough.moreso than any other cRPG. You can spend hours here because of how many options you haveso if character creation / build crafting is your thing then youll get your moneys worth.while an Aeon will rewrite historyetc.so similar to DnD 3.5. Turn-based and real-time are both options depending on preference and you can fine-tune difficulty settings as needed.so the writers had a great foundation to build off of. The writing (thankfully) never feels long-winded like many fantasy RPGs tend to do and I genuinely enjoyed talking to NPCs and getting to know the companions. I also appreciate that you can mouse over keywords in dialogue if you want background info on a topic.some felt a little forced (over-acting).so if you jump in and this applies to you then make sure you go through character creation and see if you can load into the intro cutscenes. There is currently 1 gamebreaking bug in Act 3 (so half way through the game) related to the Crusade mechanic that Owlcat is aware of.  Otherwise the game is stable with minor bugs that should be fixed quicklybut you may run into a quirk here and there particularly with the turn-based combat.that works too.Kingmaker was the darkhorse of the recent cRPG crop. It came out of relatively nowhere and impressed with its scope and soul. Rough around the edgesbut an absolute diamond of a game. Having played thatit would be a massive understatement to say I was excited to see what Owlcat would do next. In factI was totally hyped. I followed the development of their next Pathfinder gamethis time based on the Wrath of the Righteous adventure modulewith undiminished interest throughout. Now it is here. Time to see if it meets my extraordinarily high expectations.the setup. For a century the demons of the Worldwound have plagued the kingdom of Mendev and all Golarion. A mighty portal that allows the denizens of the Abyss free access to the Material Plane remains open there. The mortal races have tried repeatedly to push the demons out of their world and shut down their gateway. Four great crusades they have fought and four times they have failed. Nowled by the Demon Lord Deskarithe abyssal hordes are stirring againlaying waste to the great citadel of Kanabres. This time though something has changed. A new champion has appearedgifted with great power the hero takes charge of the crumbling crusader forces and leads a counterattack. The fifth crusade is about to begin. The powers that be are beginning to move again and Areelu Vorleshthe infamous architect of the Worldwoundis watching from the shadows.the combat generally engagingthe experience endearingly familiar. Baldurs Gate veterans will feel right at home from the get go. Instead of showering the game with more contrived praise though I will be focusing on what did change and there are several alterations. Some fairly significant. The problem is many of them left me with mixed feelings. I will discuss in more detail some of thosenamely: the expanded classes/races and the inclusion of mythic levelsthe effect this has on difficultythe army management mode which replaces the old kingdom management mode and finally the shift in tone of the story and characterizations.however beautifuldid not appear to be as clearly designed as it could have been. The many abilities offering similar skills made it needlessly obtuse. Feats that act as other featsspells you can waste spell picks on when you would get them thanks to some class feature anyway and of course bugs. Because complexity always leads to bugs. Wrath expands on the number of classes and races. In principle thats a good thing. But it does little to actually streamline this already fairly overwhelmed system. It doesnt quite push it over the edgebut gets it that much closer to the brink.they form an additional leveling system and provide extraordinary powers. A very interesting ideathat burdens with more complexity a system at its limit. The result is rather messy. In particular features like additional bloodlines or domains are very poorly handled. An overhaul of this system is quite necessary. Mythic levels also have a story component. They offer players a series of paths they can followto narratively transform into a mythical being. Such as an angela demon or a lich. In principlea welcome feature. But not all mythic paths are built equal. The evil ones in particular dont seem very fleshed out. Furthermorethere are advanced mythic paths which you can only switch to near the end of the game. Those simply dont have enough screentime to matter.but the power bloat in Wrath is exasperated further by mythic levels. Owlcat again follows the flawed approach of inflating enemy stats to increase difficulty. Enemies with unreasonably high armor classes and saves are pretty much the norm. But that doesnt really make the game properly harderit simply restricts the player and promotes more specific exploits. Add the mythic abilities that some bosses in particular get and combat can quickly get very frustrating. Combat is a big part of the game and having to repeatedly reload in hopes of getting better rolls is hardly ideal. Thankfully the game does offer a highly modular difficulty systemI just wish the defaults were better balanced.Wrath combines classic party based adventuring with a more strategic aspect. In Kingmaker that was kingdom managementhere it is Crusade management. This mode combines a greatly simplified version of the old kingdom management with a new army management system. The army part is a simplified take on the Heroes of Might and Magic formula. You guide your armies on the overmap and fight enemy armies in a small grid-based battlefield. It is no accident I used the word simplified twice. Kingdom management in Kingmaker was already not very fleshed outbut it worked and was interesting. Rather than expanding it so it could realise its potentialOwlcat cut the number of buildings and synergies and diminished the importance of towns. Army management simply fails to make up for that loss. This modethough not badultimately feels unfocused and spread thin.here we have irredeemably evil companions. Here you cant always force a happy ending. The world is bleaker. Howeverthere is an important problem with that. The game kinda sucks at being evil. Im going to ignore the laughably bad omnicidal reactions the game sometimes offers. Just *ugh*. Even in more nuanced situations thoughthe game underdelivers. The plot feels like it was written expecting you to play the good guy. A lot of things simply work better when you are on the side of the angels. A lot of evil options seem like afterthoughts in comparison. No matter whatyou are the hero that will drive out the demons anyway. That betrays a lack of coherent direction. Thankfullyevil companions have more depth. Showcasing the writers can do evil well when they want to. One of the brightest examples perhaps is Camellias romanceit really shines on an evil route.there is lots of unforced errors. The addition of map rotation for instance. Great featureuntil you realize that in a certain city later onits used to determines what the map will look like. Cue in confusion and bewilderment. Alsothe various puzzles present. Nice additionsI love a good puzzle. They are interesting and difficult. Thats good. They are also obtuse and intrusive. Thats bad. Im all for solving a clearly defined hard puzzleguesswork is less fun. Puzzles that block my progress? Even less. Then we have bugs. Kingmaker had launched in a sorry state and I really hoped Owlcat would have learnt their lesson. They didnt. Granted the game is consistently being patched and I have no doubt it will end up in good shape. So why not go early access for a few months instead?Wrath had lots of ideas to tweak the recipe and great potentialbut Owlcat somehow managed to consistently be their own worst enemysabotaging their effort to improve on their previous game. The end result is a step back from Kingmaker. Of course a step back from one of the great cRPGs of our timeeven two or three steps backis still in the realm of pretty damn good. Despite the shortcomingsI enjoyed this game. After it is properly patched I intend to replay it again. Do I recommend it? To cRPG fansyes. Lets keep in mind there arent many people out there doing what Owlcat does.This game is easily one of the best games I have played this year. It is a huge step up from Kingmaker and shows that Owlcat is really trying to broaden its horizons in terms of mechanics. And my recommendation is that you dont touch this game for at least 6 monthsa year at most.but for the love of God dont play it for a while. Owlcat has dropped the ball with its QA department yet again and combine that with some bad decisions during the beta has led to some unfortunate issues with the 4th and 5th act of the game. Mystic paths are clearly not working as intended since testers didnt have access to these final actswriting and balance take a drastic nosedive from start to finish by act and bugs can range from slightly annoying to game breaking. I dont think the game needs more time to be developedlike a Cyberpunkmore that the game clearly needed proper beta testing for the final actsto give proper criticism for what clearly has flaws. Bugs arent even my biggest complaintitâ€™s the clear balance issues that exist in the game right now in the later sections. If you arent minmaxing your party to an insane degreeyou will be forced to turn down the difficulty as fights progressively get more and more untenable. It is insane that anyone thought it was a good idea to have mob enemies with 80+ AC on a core difficultyand thats not even getting into the base stat inflation of enemiesand ludicrous amounts of attacks per turn that most enemies will have by the end of the game. When the last two bossesthat have been hyped up for most of the gamearent nearly as hard as one of the mob trash in the last actyou have clearly made a mistake somewhere along the way.those previously mentioned innovative mechanics are somewhat broken as of this moment and will actively hinder your experience if you try them. The crusade mechanics dont work properly a decent part of the timewith some event cards and decrees being stuck on my list since act 3stat bonuses are sometimes incorrectsometimes straight up game breaking. Itâ€™s not just buggybut a slog from a game-play perspective. If you arent extremely lucky and manage to hire a mage general out the gateyou will be in for a rough timeas troops will have to fight enemies for hundreds of turns due to a weird balance as of this moment. You could just enable auto-crusade if you really want to skip itbut somehow in doing so you will skip some of the more interesting paths in the gamethat are still very buggy mind youas the game relies on certain events to happen within the crusade for mythic path events to fire. Even the rewards you get from these crusadesancient relics that have either been protected by the godsor corrupted beyond redemption that might help you out in your battlesare brokensince sometimes the game just kind of forgets to give them to you or to give you the option to actually use them.but not enough to necessarily hinder your experience that muchand whatâ€™s there up to act 5 is very goodthe story is interesting and the worlds reactivity to your decisions is astounding. And then act 5 happens. Act 5 somehow manages to destroy a decent part of the build up to the games climaxand act 5 is where most of the bugs I encountered managed to show up on mass. The NPCs stop feeling as reactive as before aswithout spoiling itcritical events occur in a brief periodyet it seems like nobody really cares? Characters stop feeling like characters and become objects in the world spaceand its honestly so disappointing to see a great build up to such a massive let down. I can only hope that they might see the complaints that have arisen with the final act and do some big story patch that adds in dialogue to examine more closely what happens in act 5 and give these characters they have been introducing a better send off in its closingbut I wont hold my breath.there is clearly a fantastic CRPGbeyond all these issues. The story is interesting and takes some pretty big changes from the tabletop module that I think are for the best and depending on your mythic path the story could go in a vastly different direction from another. The companions are way more interestingat least to mecompared to Kingmakerwith a lot more reactivity to the events around themchiming in more frequently and putting their personality in the fore front. Theres a lot of side details as well that impressed mereactivity to race selection that Im certain wasnt in Kingmakeralong with dialogue specifically for those following certain deitiesmaking your choice of faith matter far more than just being a minor stat improvementmaking your selections in the character creator count significantly. The voice acting is also very impressivethroughout the entire gameit is very clear that the VAs are giving it their bestfrom Anevia to Deskari everyone sounds greatand it really helps to flesh out the NPCsand it is a crying shame that it really doesnt lead to much in act 5 destroys a part of that personality to NPCs.and having finished the game I would say it was worth itbut being a good game at a fundamental level doesnt excuse a vast amount of bugs that litter the gamebalance issues that plague the late gameand what feels like an unfinished 5th act. There will come a day when many of the bugs have been patched out and we have Wrath of the Righteous Enhanced Edition Plusbut the core issues with act 5 will always be thereand I would keep that in mind should you decide to play the game. I can only hope that Owlcat sees the community feedback and takes the necessary changesbut if the response to the beta is any indicationwhat we have here is what we get.I think this is my favorite cRPG. ThereI said it.yesmost of them technical. I reported no less than two dozen bugs through the ingame (Alt + B) report system. I also think its fair to say that the incredible ambition of this project went a bit beyond Owlcats capabilities as a studio. HoweverI appreciate what theyve done. I respect the audacity to go a bit beyondinstead of being completely safe and thus doing nothing new. They got enough of it rightmore than enough reallyfor this to have been an incredible experience.i was very doubtfull about the next Pathfinder crpgthe issue was rather the added in city-building mechanic and the heavy dependancy on time gated events (or time limits).enviroments and even item 3D models have been done with quite some attention to detailed and the lighting-engine does wonders to breath live in a top-down world. what is especialy remarkable are all the little animations; your characters got their unqiue idle-animations (a monk npc doing some katasa palading prayingetc.) to enviromental animations like water (in one of the first dungeons)to random clutter beeing animated.but most important dialogue isso are spellcastconfirmations and shouts (during combat)aswell as very well done ingame cut-scene (which reminds me even more of the good ol Infinite Engine times). was voice acting is there is top-level. ive yet to find an actor that makes my ears bleed...which is already great.spell effectsetc.) are on point.but got improved. pretty much every detail during gameplay can be referencedso that even newcomers to Pathinder can get an overview of statisticslore and most important enemy resistances/immunities.while still beeing visualy appealing. there are stats over statsfeats and skillsclassessub classes (even some realy out-there ones) and sub races and and andtheres a metric ton of optional side contentheck even optional ""mini-bosses)more potential party-members that you will be able to recrute in your 6 slot partybut from the very beginning the plot is presentgoals are clearly communicatedwhich might be partly due to how the plot is structured.Icewind Dale and co. where once the pinnacle of crpgsBeen stuck in character creation for 2 hours - so many choices that I chose to go to bed instead...Be warnedthe game couldve been in development for another 6 months just for bugfixing. Some are gamebreaking and some are blocking progress.loremusic and general atmosphere are amazing.Having finished the gamethe short version is: amazingly complexepic RPG when it comes to character building. This could be one of the best games of this type out therebut it has problems. Some of these will be related to it being made by a still small company in a comparatively short periodothers with the desire to remain true to the pnpwhich imo doesnt always translate that well.but the azata path is perfect for misfits as its all about inclusivenessfreedom and cuteness really. As silly as this soundsI was so fond of my character by the end of the gameits hard for me to envisage trying another playthrough. The complexity the mythic paths offer and the number of class choices there are along with how this changes the story are really mind-blowing. I also really liked to liked most of the companions. The two I wasnt too keen on have the pros that in one case you only need to take her along three times and the other one sticks around even if you end up not helping her. Alsounless you build a character that can pass a lot of skill checks themselvesyou will likely end up with a stable partyas switching out characters can leave you crippled as regards skill checks otherwise. All in allthis is a massively ambitious game which imo has been pretty well implementedesp considering the restraints mentioned above and the scope of the audience that needs to be catered to.buggy gamesI highly recommend waiting to play.boringbadly implemented and dreadfully explained. Dealing with it as well as questing and the crusade management aspect involves hella micromanagementtedious loading screens and  - as I discovered too lateday skipping. In my caseId slogged through the map with a sub-par army so I could quest in peaceonly to find myself amassing vast amounts of now useless troops (that were much better than the ones Id used) and both the morale and the conquest banner flipping to yellow. In other wordsif you want to max all your crusade statsyou will probably want to leave some forts to be conquered and spend some time in between questing and fighting armies in crusade modejust hanging around in your headquarters skipping days to move stuff along. Also dont be afraid to wait until you can recruit a lot of decent units unless you want to reload some battles a lot of times.sometimes aggroing the next fight. To spice it up even morethe game starts lagging horrendously at this point.for instance. Theres a super useful item you get early on that the game deactivates constantlymeaning you have to check literally every time you do anything - restpass a loading screenwhatever (I could go onbut it would be boring). Turn-based mode is also inherently buggy atm. Thats not to say the games unplayable  - if I managed it most reasonably capable gamers should and the difficulty sliders (use them!) mean you can tune it to your preference. I really didnt feel very special at the end of the game due to the way the difficulty increases faster than your power does at this point in the game.in particular lawful evilis just uptight kill / imprison everyone who doesnt do as toldwhereas good is some kind of super naive forgive everyone no matter what atrocities they have committed and even if they dont even pretend they regret anything (an attitude thats also held by one of the companions). I expect its least irritating if you play some kind of neutralas then you wont feel like you ought to be picking the ""good"" or ""evil"" options even when you think they are ridiculous. Having said thatI kept my chaotic good alignment pretty much dead centre in spite of frequently not picking the good or chaotic options - its just better to pick the option with no alignment descriptor most of the time if you dont want to end up changing it. Howeverthere are scrolls of atonement allowing you to get your alignment backor you can respec your character which allows you to pick alignment again and resets it BUT its bugged atm.slow movement on the mapmechanics that are there to basically force you to spend more time moving around the map slowly and ploughing through loading screens. Missing 9 times out of 10 even with a level 20 myth 9 party on nerfed normalrng-based checks that can be circumvented by reload-spamming. During restingcompanions talk which is the only probut this imo is much better in Dragon Agewhere your party talks while you walk around and even build up relationships with one another (so without forcing you to sit there staring at an ugly resting interface).but in short: flawed masterpiece which will get a lot better with bug fixing and other improvementsbut itll stay micromanagement and loading screen intenseas well as laggy and probably difficulty-spikish and hence a slog in parts. Oh and the puzzles are terrible. Ohand finallygetting the ideal playthrough (and/or the secret ending) will require either a lot of playthroughs and and epic memory/note taking effort or extensive meta-gaming.This game made me feel like Im back in my childhoodplaying Baldurs Gate 2which made a big impression on me and developed my love of RPGs as well as D&D (pen and paper included). I was under the erroneous impression Pathfinder was but a different variation of D&Deven iffor all intents and purposesto meit still remains as such.amazing experience (so farabout 14 hours in and I feel like Im barely scratching the surface)which gives plenty of tutorials for the newer player to explain some of the basics and tipsyet still offers a lot to someone knowledgeable about the mechanics and tactics. Having said thisI do have to berate the game for giving me the impression my exploiter wizard (a class I had never heard of before) required INT and CHAnot the usual INT and DEX. As it turns outhaving little DEX does affect your ability for all kinds of touch attacksmaking your character rather... ahem... useless in most cases. Who wouldve thought? :)the mechanics are all therethere are PLENTY of classes and even more spellsabilitiesitems and enemies. Combat is fun and feels satisfyingespecially when your tactics go right and exploit the enemys weakness or reduce their advantages. The actual animations might not be *quite* as polished assayDivinity: Original Sin 2 or Baldurs Gate 3but thats a minor complaint.the characters themselves a lot of funbringing intrigue and a wish to learn more about them. There is voice actingwhich is pretty darn good most of the timealthough not all of the text (of which there is a lot) is voiced. Prepare to read.sometimes they will define your character or decide what companion you might gain or lose. So farIve felt like my choices actually mattered and werent simply superficialwhich is saying a lot these days.but theyre at the very beginning)but they seem to be bringing some seriously epic changes to your character [spoiler](fancy turning into a demon? A dragon? A lich?)[/spoiler].especially epic onesand this game delivers on a scale I havent heard of in a while. Veryvery enjoyable.here is a video:edit edit edit: one last update. Beat the game. The last two acts felt SUPER rushed writing and timing wisethe enemy/boss difficulty is all sorts of wacky (way too easy and way too hardinconsistent) andetc. etc. Overall Im not too dissatisfied because I love the genre - the number of people extolling their love for the genreand thus willingness to suffer bugsshould tell you a lot.everI guess? They sleep standing upflying around? Why does that not work? Its a mind-affecting ability that makes them lie down of their own volition. Are they physically unable to be proneeverno matter what?? Theres a crossbow that pushes enemies back. Sounds neat? Well it triggers AOOs.. on YOUR units when the enemy is pushed away from them. That sure makes sensehuh? (Also you lose your full attack if the enemy is pushed back on the first shoteven if there are other enemies in range.) Also the knockback is supposed to be 15ft but its unlimited until they hit an obstacle. This is the FIRST heavy crossbow in the game thats magicuntested and broke. Owlcat must have an ungodly long list of ridiculously straightforward bugs to fix becausefranklymany of these are so obviously shortsighted oversights and niche situations.. but its these precise situations that youre supposed to seek out in this sort of game with so many options. When it doesnt work at all how its supposed to it becomes frustrating and sillywhich I felt far too often during my playthrough.NPCs allegedly trained to fight demons.. and they do nothing but spam frost cantrips.. against demons with 10 cold resist. They will literally never deal damage. Their crusader training consisted of ""spam spells that will never hurt the demons!"" I guess. No wonder theyre having a hard time dealing with the worldwound. How utterly stupid. And its this sort of thing that rears up over and over again and every time it reminds you that its a hot mess and totally wrecks immersion.though? Is just how much is broken.Over and over. Feats that dont workitems that are brokeneffects that do the wrong damage amountsenemies that ignore effects you manage to land on themetc. etc. First act stuffearly gamebroken 100%. Untested. Weakening Wound to lower DR? Doesnt workat allperiod. No effect. Cool. Love wasting feats.Im sad to say. Act 6climatic moments.. and its just a hot mess. NPCs you have grown to know through the game valiantly rush in to join your cause! .. and die in one hit. Or better yetstand behind your party and spam AE Greater Shouts that stun and damage your entire partymaking the fights WAY HARDER for absolutely no reason. I would prefer they not be there at allits just horrid design that they have no concern for friendly fire whatsoever. A bunch of quests are broken and cant be completed. One in particular involved literal hours of puzzlingonly for the last partthe ""get a reward""to be broke. Neat. The ""Trickster"" is just a drunken jackoff that is more Youtube pranks and ""LOLRANDOM"" than anything clever or ""tricky"" at allIm super disappointed in how it was writtenbut thats at least a matter of personal taste. Ive continued to find item after item that simply doesnt work whatsoever. I wish I could love everything this game is but it needs so much bug fixing still to be a remotely smooth experience. Characters you retrain get basically totally broken -my mercenary hasnt had toggleable abilities that work for several acts.Act 4and sadly my feelings stand. Overallbroad strokes - I love it. But do I recommend it as is? Not quiteunless youre WAY into the genre. So many bugs. Tons of magic items that just do not work at all. Frequent issues with getting physically/permanently stuck (especially in act 4 - neat idea/mechanicwonky implementation.) The aforementioned NPC companion is just gone foreverso I just lost out on that from a bug. With some patches this will probably be a stellar example of the genre - but thats an ""IF""not a ""do you recommend it right nowas is.""so ""no"" it is. ThanksSteam!I love the game because of what it should be and what its based on. As it ishoweverthe bugginess is kindve maddening. Its one thing to have a random +1 bonus not stack right or not applysure finetheres a lot of complexity going onbut its a whole nother thing to..rezdhealedor otherwise recovered. Neat.for examplehas no vampiric toggle. It just isnt there.)to not get the right number of attacksto lose your turn randomly when you use a swift action and not get to make a move/standardetc.suffer against DRetc.this doesnt even touch on balance issues - full BAB characters need 20s to hit in half the fights. Meanwhile foes get 4-6 attackshit on a 2and one-round your heaviest of tanks - only mirror image can save you unless you do the cheesy stacking monk tank or some other hacky build. 80% of the enemies are immune lightning and have 20-30SR10 fire/cold/acid resistetc.your casters will be sad. You can turn the difficulty down to a degreebut I feel like ""normal"" difficulty shouldnt mean you have a 5% chance to hit. ""oh just use touch spells for high AC"" Oh you mean the ones they get opportunity attacks againstSR againstand arent available for many circlesdamage typesand casters? Great plan. The tragedy is that rather than become ""difficult"" and ""strategic"" it becomes ""reload until you sleep/trip/etc.then wail with AOOs."" Thats bad design. Maybe if youre running a full munchkin party its finebut if youre not its just silly.stat loss/level drain is FAR too rampant in the early game when you have no way to deal with it. Have a character that can cast restoration? Well they wont do it when resting in the safety of town.. you have to put them in your partygo somewherecast itthen walk back to town and swap your party back around. Tedious and silly.I can and will endure it because this genre is my absolute favorite. If its not your absolute favorite you should probably wait a while. So much of this is imminently fixable and obviously buggedits not even obscure or subtle. Much of it has been reported already in betathoughand some of it is as basic as ""class doesnt get ability button at level X""which is like.. The most basic of QA you could do for each class. Nevermind if it works or notyou dont even get a button to *try* to use it.you can probably deal with the bugs. If you dontjust wait and hope they fix a lot of whats wrongbecause there is a LOT of bugginess that just isnt excusable. It gets worse and worse the further you get - at present a playable and mostly-polished act 1 becomes a slightly funky act 2 becomes a hot mess of act 3 becomes a slog of act 4etc.+ Funinteresting combatalthough poorly integrated into the narrative and dialoguereally lets you go wildbig battlesand convosfun charactersinconsistent writing with shallow exploration of its ideasbut they are too campy about it so it ends up seeming like cartoony ultra-high fantasy. Compare Diablo 3 to Diablo 1 -- the latter had a much more maturesinister take on hell and demonswhile the former made them seem like zany cartoon villains.cacklingmockingbad-movie evil. Lots of ""Muahaha"" to be heard with little in the way of believable motivations - and not just from the demonswho might be excused if the writing explored the nature of being a demon better. But theres no complexity""That monster seems so... monstery.""youd usually have no idea because theyre so poorly thought through. The choices are often something like: ""Youll never win!!"" (Good) vs. ""Well defeat youdemon!!"" (Evil). Strong emphasis on the mechanic of shifting alignment over the content of whats being said/done. Just pick the options that youre ""supposed"" to pick for your builds alignment and mythic path. (Strong emphasis in this game of MECHANICS over story or roleplaying.)even though you would never have decided to do that. Paradoxicallyyou often feel like you have no agency. (Example: ""You run at the demon."" What? NoI would never do that.)there are few roleplaying opportunities. The range of personalities represented in the dialogue is too narrow and the thought behind them too shallow.combat is really fun.I recommend to fans of crunchymechanical RPGsbut not to fans of story games. This is a dungeon-crawler. It has amazing build diversity. Awesome fights. Great builds. Immaturechildish writingand some of the corniest implementation of choice & consequence Ive ever seenalthough the choices are significant. Expect a bubblegum-pop fantasy story that is high-flying and grandbut ultimately just shallow escapism.One of the best isometric RPGs I have ever played. A huge improvement over Kingmaker in nearly every aspect.be it in character creation and customizationor in dialogue options that push the story forward.overlapping and branching based on your actions.a good middle ground between serious and tongue-in-cheekso that it perfectly emulates the feel of playing D&D with some friends. Companions are variedinteract often and are generally enjoyable to have around.little things that reinforce immersion.including voice-overs. Stauntons VO is a g"

naval seems to be abstracted or nonexistent so far)and I estimate that liberally  All of these things are tightly wrapped up in a decision-based management system that produces causes and effects; with some of the effects being far-reachingso he accuses you of having an incestuous relationship  You decide to Deny it  He gets even madder  One of your courtiers hears a rumor that the clergyman is plotting to kill your daughter  So you secretly arrange for him to be murdered  The neighboring Lord finds out through spies that you're responsibleso he blackmails you  Even though you pay him offhis cousinthe Lord in the OTHER neighboring county decides you're weak and decides to lay claim to YOUR title armies marchwars get foughtetcthis gets THAT complicated  And the levels of all of these interactions get very deep and very complicatedlike a spider webI'm loving it (although to be frankthe ""new"" hasn't quite worn off yet)  The biggest advice I can give anyone thinking about buying CK3 is what I said up front:  Make Sure You Know What You're buyingyou'll be disappointed  If you buy it only looking for an empire builder (like CIV)you'll be disappointedI sucked at CK2This game is easier to learn than CK2 They practically hold your hand while you are playing Learning curve is not as steep as CK2 or EU4 Very Enjoyable experience Recommend for sure I have enjoyed these games for 1000s of hours and will continue to do so and hopefully teach my son when hes olderShould you get this game?

0,"I'm Chinese and I played these games since the early 2000sthey were never technically great even back thenI've always treated them as more like visual novelsinteractive moviesthat kind of thing. Only later I realized these are basically Chinese Final Fantasy (since foreign console games were not accessible in China back then).you shouldn't expect AAA quality hereit's more of an indi gamewhich I think is fair for the half price it's asking.but smaller in budget even compared to older FF games like 13. Animations look stiffthere's no interactivity with the environmentRPG/combat elements are pretty generic. The game runs.. oknot great but since it's UE4 it can't be too bad either. Currently the issue with performance I believe has to do with asset fetchingwhenever there's a big change in camera angle the game stuttersand I'm running 2 970PRO NVME in RAID0I can only imagine running this game from an HDD would be a nightmare.with RTX on ""very high"" you even get RT caustics in the ponds which is quite impressivedon't think I've seen this in any other gamealthough this is obviously just a drop-in effect they could enable in any UE game. I mean it's a pleasant visual novel to sit throughjust don't expect Horizon Zero Dawn or Last of Us. In fact it's quite similar to other JRPGs like Tales of Arisebut it's not asking full price for early 2000s game design.here are some of the bad designs you won't see from an AAA game even from a couple years ago:they're just there to waste your time to look for them.the locations look rather impressive and unique from afar but if you walk around you find things like placement of everything make no sense for people who might actually live thereno washrooms for example.everybody just teleports everywhere. So for example instead of a door with a staircase to get in a towerthey just teleport up. I could accept if only the most prestigious locations had these teleport magicbut no they're practically common place in all but regular cities.which makes sense in the storybut for gameplay reasons they are in fact trash and you can just buy better weapons at the next small village you visit.everyone's wearing clothing fresh from the drywasher.but they all look like end-game weapons in a fantasy game none of them look any simpler or weaker than others. again the gameplay is entirely divorced from the narrative.and not based on the story. You'd think a magic academy might sell better weapons than a normal citybut nobecause you go there firstthey sell worse weapons.it's like an NES game where the items you can have are fixedand you can have 99 of each of them.only to watch a custsceneand then travel to B for another cutsceneand then to A againfor yet another cutscene.given character controlso you can literally walk 2 meters for the next cutscene. It feels like the devs really wanted to make a visual novel and not an actual video game.the game is completely linear except you can do some option fetch quests in-between.like you just bought new weaponsyou don't even get to use them before they're outdated.and you always have only ONE best weapon at any moment. In other wordsusing a new weapon is no different from just having a few more attack power in your character. So why not just NOT HAVE ANY OF THESE WEAPONS? You'd remove some conflicts with the story and make that more immersiveand cut down on some production costs.your team mates will safely kill the boss for you.The game is surprisingly fun and I really feel bad for the developer that The full game was cracked 1 week before its official launch on steam. I bought it the first minute it was live because I wanted to support them.cool skill effectsit's even more detailed than many AAA gamesThis is a bilingual review in general especially for English Reader.the enemy does not feel being hit most of the time especially for the boss fightsuch than it's enjoyable even if I need to pause to do something else where the music is very comfortable as usual work or sleep in most cases.and it will lower your FPS significantly (take up too much from GPU) --- PS: I have 3060.no facial expression was properly designed. This is part I believe that developer will gradually improve their design.and it is more like a sword and magic world with storytelling focus.sure it's not perfectbut compared to some recent triple-A games and new releases this yearS&F 7 turned out great; with its outstanding graphics(rtx on the entire time)storytellinglovely charactersand beautiful soundtrack; for half the pricethis has no competitor.except for a one-time black screen upon fast travel.where people describe 'unplayable situations' and how there're 'constant crashes' on every corneri haven't encountered any of that.looking forward to starting the game over again in the future.Bought this based off the digital Foundry review of it and i was NOT disappointedHaving been a longtime Sword and Fairy fan (also known as Chinese Paladin in previous titles)7 really outshines the previous installments and does a lot to revitalize this now nearly 2 decade old franchise.as is the removal of some of the more cliche dialogue. Highly impressed by the 2 hours + demo I've played so far and looking forward to the story.they even have marked viewpointstwo ledges that look like the same drop will have 1 be jumpable and 1 not for whatever reasonwould not recommend this game if you're not interested in the story as there are better arpgs out therethankfullly a minoritymaking autos feel clunky at timescaveat being you have to be into the Xianxia aesthetic. 8/10Just my few short comments on the translation and some of the technical aspects. So farI have liked what Iâ€™ve played and I will play more and I do recommend this game.which entries are called as â€œlivesâ€ instead of â€œentriesâ€or changing fonts and spacings in the words in said codex. The dialogue also shows varying translation quality with very peculiar sentence structures.you donâ€™t need to speak Chinese to understand what is going on and the translation is generally ok to good from my short experience.the game is gorgeousespecially with raytracing (AMD userswill have to wait â€˜til future date for raytracing features at the time of writing this). The unfortunate side-effect of RT isof coursethat the game is very heavy to run with all bells and whistles on. Expect to either turn on DLSS (if on nVidia cards) or lower other settings if you want raytracing on.the gameâ€™s settings are bit unique. The game offers full screenwindowed and borderless windowed for running the game. The full screen -option only allows you to choose your current desktop resolution and it can be affected by any display scaling you use causing blurriness or other issues. The graphical settings are your standard low-medium-high. The raytracing options range from off to super high without ability to set specific options used. DLSS ranges from super performance to qualityBUT the game only allows you to set it on or off and set the sharpness used for the DLSS. DLSS is also turned on automatically if you turn on the raytracing. A work-around is to set the DLSS levels either via ini-file or via Geforce Experience. Changing some of the settings in-game will require a restartespecially raytracing related ones.which can be annoying. The sound and music is greatbut sometimes the loudness of sounds can change. A surround sound is providedgranted one has the audio system for it. I experienced some clicking noise which Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s a glitch or intentionalbut it was bit annoying. I did not experience any crashes in the game during my short time of playing. There is also object pop-in/culling that can be very immersion breaking depending on your personal preferences.so if one wants to play especially on higher resolutionsmake sure you have more than 8gb of VRAMotherwise with memory flushing there might be short freezes. The game also warns about thisif it detects the VRAM is less than 10gb on 4k resolution.nor is nVidias Ansel seemingly built inwhich is a shame because this game with its set pieces is extraordinary pretty.I have played Tale of Arise and Gujian 3 which is similar genre so I'm gonna make a review comparing to those 2 games.you rely mostly on skills for damage (which is one press wonder). Despite the fancy cut scenesthe actual combat is sluggish. No air combono air dashdashing stuck between rocksbushes. Calling itself an ARPG with this type of gameplay is really disappointing.some was bad. Most main towns and sects are beautiful and packedwhile others are just empty plain and corridors.the NPCs move on with their livesit makes you pay attention to their tidbits. Kudos to thisthis is better than both ToA and Goujian.a little worse than G3. The 4 main characters is a little generic with no real distinct personality or appearance (I swear they look like preset chinese mmorpg characters). But stillno anime cringe worthy conversation which is a blessing. ****Slight spoiler ahead****Though the ending changed little to nothing to the structure of the worldwhich renders whatever you did kinda useless? Deities still stuck in their heavenly arses. The pacing at the end felt kinda rushed. Shotgun romanceI understand Moquing and Yo affection since then knew each other from childhoodbut what the hell is even going on between Wu Xiu and Yue? their banter is cute don't get me wrongbut I don't understand where their affection came from.like zero. A huge boss fell into the waterand you hear nothing. Boss stomps on the groundyou feel nothing.falling through the ground that sort of things.I don't even understand half of what they saying lol. Wrong pronoun here and there. I get it Chinese language has gender neutral pronouns which can be hard for translatorsbut it looks like nobody actually played through the game and make the corrections. Our girl Yue is called a dude half of the time.Ramp up the combat. Slow down the pacing. Improve the translation.About 12 hours into the gameI'm totally into it and loving the story.and battles (average difficulty) are quick and numerous to keep you moving fast through different maps. The story and characters are very well developed and the voice acting is excellent. The world is beautiful and extremely detailed (fengshui itemshistorical layout of buildingseven down to the medicine props in some cities)I sometimes forget that its a game and I'm not a passive viewer. These are movie-like quality scenes that are superbly choreographed.the cutscenes are quite heavy in the gameof which the story is quite linear for most part and not truly an open-world RPGbut that is ok by me. This is the kind of game you'll probably want to play an hour or two and take a breakrushing it would ruin your experience.down to the casual interactions with townsfolkbut then the cost of the game would have been much much higher.so I'm not sure if the English translations are inaccurate.Up to chapter 20 so farcompleted every single side questjumping puzzle & card game the game has offered me so far.story is decent but combat is where this game shines. It's so much fun and so flashyespecially the spells.though can be a little hard to run.this is a must play.I like this game. It's not the best in the series but definitely above average.This is an absolutely beautiful gameand I am very happy that we have a chance to play it with English subtitles. If the dev team sees thisTHANK YOU for giving us the opportunity to experience your game. I am running at 1080P using a GTX 2070 Super video cardand I've had no issues so far. Everything is set to High with DLSS set to Qualityand ray tracing is off. I tested ray tracing and I could even run the game okay (and it looked fantastic) but I'm leaving it off to get the smoothest gameplay.which is right up my alley. The translation is rough in a few spots but generally very goodand even quite charming at times. The world design is just stunningand the music is excellent as well. You will have a party of charactersI only have three at the moment and you can switch between them at will. The combat is very smooth. In village areas there are many items to find and pick upalong with easy side quests. There's a cooking system where you can create buff foodsthere's a blacksmith system for upgrading gearand there is an in-game Library where you can read more about the charactersenemiesand even the music tracks (and you can play the different tracks as well). For the pricethis is an excellent game and I hope we get English translations for future games in the series. Recommended.Kept an eye for a long time on this game and was excited to play itThe graphics are amazingRunning the game at max setting's with 1440p rtx very high and getting somewhat okay fps 50 sometimes below 40This game is visually stunning one of the most gorgeous games I've ever playedThe village is so lively and uniquedifferent from generic ""village"" you find in most rpgs.but it's not dark soul difficult.just like typical wuxia storymight not be for everyone. But still it is quite enjoyable .this game is a stealSword and Fairy 7 is a pretty amazing game and fully translated to Englishnot perfect but enjoyable with delightful cutscenes.an AA game that looks like an AAA one. Perfect combo with a good OST. Fights are dynamic and nervous with spectacular bosses. Mini-games are sympathetic with an extensive card game.one perfect thing is the small price: Only 25â‚¬ray-tracing causes massive stuttering.I'm sure developers will deliver paths soon to fix them.you cannot change the difficulty setting in mid-game.[b]Graphics[/b]it mentions actual Chinese myththeir design is prettymain male character kinda reminds me of Cloud Strife (just my opinion tho)performance and not so smooth gameplay even tho I have an high end laptop - anyway I was able to fix itread my steps below if you got the same problemclick on manage 3D settings and on Global Settings tab select High-performance NVIDIA processor under preferred graphics processordon't close the control panel and click on program settings just besides the global settings tab and select a program to customize (select sword and fairy 7) and change these settings:Honestly this is such an incredible game. The visuals were fantasticmusic was great and story I thought was awesome. I only saw one or two glitches during the entire game that happened during fighting where everyone fell through the map right away. I just reloaded the game which saved right before it and it worked fine the second time.it's just not perfect SOMETIMES. If that's game breaking for you then you're probably not fun at parties.Overall 8/10I personally recommended to give it a go:turn of RTX if you got a lower end PC.I'd say it is way worth the price. It's way better than I expected.this might be subjective but I gotta say I like this one better then Gujian3and I own both of them. I managed to finish this game even I'm not a WuXia guy.the architecturethe locationand the main characters. These are some of the best thing about the game. Our female lead is no longer that innocent sweet girl who doesn't know anythingshe's strongsmartcalmlogical and brave leader of the teamshe's very different.one is AAA and this is not.I'm not sure what are they expectingI mean you won't be seeing NieR series in here for sureit's not gonna be the The Last Of Usit's not gonna be Inception nor Tenet. Simple story doesn't mean it is a bad storylike the Lord of the Rings for example. Diablo 2 is still a great gamebut you don't bash Diablo just because it hasn't got a mind bending story... and same thing goes here.just go easy on it. The story is decent and I liked it a lot.try to save as often as you can.I spend 59 hours on my first rundecided to give it another gofor people who are giving this a trydon't listen too much comment from the internet and try to follow your own heart when playing the game. The game has a heart I'd tell yajust be patient with it.TLDR; chinese themed action RPG that looks like AAA game with quite affordable price & nice graphics but the specs is quite demanding for PC.those with low to mid spec PC might not be able to play the game smoothly. English translation a little bit too stiff but still understandable.Updated: The game crashes again and my save is no longer accessible. This is the 2nd time I lose all my progress. I give up on this gametoo buggyI have more fun with the combat and art design than Tale of Arises. That's is really huge imo since I think SnF7 is from a small dev team. Howeverit is so buggylike the worst... This is like a beta test rather than a proper release and we are paying for itfinancially and timely. After playing for a whilegame fps will drop to under 10 and the only way to fix it is to restart the client. I have 20h into the game and it crashes. NowI can not load my save and I think I'll have to redo from the beginning (ridiculous).even though I really like it when it worksand it is really nice to see a Wuxia theme gamenot even counting the fact that anytime I could be screwed into losing my save and its progress. The game has so much potentialyet is buried through its massive bug issueswhen the dev polishes out this gameI think it will be a really fun package to play and test your system graphic and OC"
1,"It's funbut it feels empty without the very overpriced DLC.$764 ""DLC"" for the full game.EA.The game is pretty coolbut seriously. Cmon EA. You couldn't even give us pets for free EVERY DLC COSTS AS MUCH AS THE GAME. That's like buying another copy! I just hate how you have to put a price tag on every little thing- [Please pay $60.00 to unlock the rest of this review.]This game is great butand every DLC costs the same The game doesn't feel complete without owning at least 5 DLC packsbut I don't have 482 dollars to throw away at some game from 2014! It's so hard to decide what to buy because there are so many packs that go togethersome that aren't complete without anotherand some that just have a couple Itmes I really want but is too expensiveSims 4 is a lot of fun but the exorbitant prices on the DLC are just too much. The DLC really adds a lot to the game so not having it hurts.88% off is a damn good price for what it's offering. I recommend it highly.It is fun. You can spend hours playing itbut the fact that the DLCs cost as much as the base game is outrageous. If there was a ""meh"" ratingI would give it simply because of that.There should be a competing title in this genre so that EA won't keep cashing in on this community which has been more and more lenient and tried its best to put up with whatever bs dlc the devs have put together. It's a shame that this franchise has fallen so far.they're some of the most cored features toothe amount of time for a sim to perform action/idling is nonsensical.such a shame to see so much game design potential being thrown into the trash because they chose the easy way out.(As expectedthe decision here came back to bite them when they design some of the dlc contentwhich feels really disrupted by the constant fast travellingif u bought  every dlc in the sims 4 it would roughly cost 700 dollars. you could either buy a ps5 or every dlc in the sims 4It really should be free on Steam if you own it on Origin.[b] Fun gamebut $800 for full content is a little bit higheven for EA...  [/b]10/10 love making myself as a sim and drowning myself whenever i'm depressed from looking at the dlc pricesGreat gamebut the downloadable content is much too expensive for how little it offers. I find myself spending countless hours playing the gamebut when I want specific things in my gamethat you can only get from the DLC and not modsit annoys me because I don't want to spend my whole paycheck on a tiny little specific detail that makes a world of difference.I play The Sims since my early teenage years. Loved every minute played...classic $E$A$ making the game boring without paying for the DLCs with each one costing the same as the base gameI love The Sims. I love The Sims 4. Here's why I don't recommend it.you will need to redownload any DLCeven if you already had it installedthe base game does notwhich means you'll have to purchase the base game again.if you purchased it on Origin (because of course it doesn't)just use ""add non-Steam game to library"". It's almost identical and $20 cheaper.You have to buy DLC packs that are near the price of the actual game to get content that you would expect to be part of the game to begin with. The vanilla barebones experience is a stale snore feast and I refuse to support scummy EA's garbage business practices with their stupid expansionsTLDR: DO NOT BUY BASE SIMS 4!! Buy it HEAVILY DISCOUNTED bundled with one of the major expansions (Seasons or Pets)and MOD THE SHIT OUT OF IT!!repetitive and easily manipulative emotions systemand an overall feeling of restriction. Which is damaging in a game series that is designed around player freedom. There are also so many irritating qualities to it that make it seem like it wasn't fine tweaked enough. Why is every single Sim such a social butterfly that I cannot get them to stop talking to each other for five seconds Why do they take so long to eat Why are the lots so small and so empty Why is nearly nothing from Sims 3and heckeven Sims 2 brought over (HorsesCarspoolsrestaurantsgrocery storesfun recreational activitiesect.)there is some classic Sim Fun to be had with this gameif you are able to get it for a heavily discounted price and get it bundled with one of the major expansions (I would recommend either Pets or Seasons). I would also highly recommend downloading a plethora of Modsbecause they fix a vast majority of the systems in base Sims 4 that make it more enjoyable. If Mods are not your thingthen I would think twice about purchasing this game. **This is one of the easiest games to Mod fyi**don't even play base Sims 4 before downloading these Mods)but a very convenient and easy way to keep track of your mods. Very user friendlywill do 100% of the work for you)and significantly less manipulatable)you are basically always guaranteed to succeed in romance. There is quite literally no way to fail. This Mod expands heavily upon itmaking it so that the traits Sims have will impact whether or not they will accept any advances.)first ImpressionsPersonality Archetypesand even a Menstrual Cycle and Birth Control system. With thisyou are more equipped to design your Sims overall sexuality and sexual lives. Hugely rewardingand designed perfectly that it will seem like it is a natural part of the game.)hairbuildingsSimsect. ""Mod The Sims"" is the best place to find all of this. Don't spend money on any of the Stuff Packsbecause most of that stuff included in them you'll find for free made by someone online. Usually looks nicer too.$850 Of DLCThe base game has about $5 worth of content. Why Because EA do what EA doesit cost around $2000 cad to get the full game. I wish I was kidding. The DLC cost just that much and they put so little into the base game so in order to enjoy the game you have to buy the DLC. Why do people support this crap How is this legal"

1,"[i][written for version 051][/i]an objective basedco-op onlyfirst-person shooter whererather than your avatar being largely defined by the gun you pick or the items and abilities you equipthey're already fully formed characters with their own uniquepre-defined abilities and specific rolesbut the main thrust of the game is Siege modewhich sees two teams of five charge to the centre of a map and try to hold an objective zone While there's a lot of nuance to the mechanics and conditions of playthe fundamentals are this - capturing an objective zone to spawn a payload earns your team one point; escorting the payload to the enemy base earns you another point; but if the opposing team manages to successfully prevent the payload from reaching their base within a set timethen they earn the point First to four points wins the matchor ""champions""technically fall into one of four different roles - front line; ""tanks"" made to take punishment and hold the objective - damage; made to dish out said punishment - support; primarily focused on healing - and flank; who are all about being sneaky-sneaky and harassing the enemy from behind I say ""technically""becauseeven though that's how they're labelled in-gamemost champions can bleed into a couple of roles to varying degreesthen you're kinda screwed and more or less have to endure a horribly unbalanced game where a team lacks any real cohesion and synergy But to help with this to some degree are loadouts and itemsand during your time outside of matchesyou can construct your own loadout based on five of these cards which boosts the effectiveness of their abilities Items are like temporary versions of cards that can be acquired mid game but are only applied for the duration of the match and bought with credits earned during play And finallythere are Legendary cardswith each champion having three of these but needing to commit to one for the whole match These are cards which apply a massive bonus to one of your abilities and can make your champ highly specialised in one aspect of performance or another But this is where you have to be really carefulas choosing the wrong cards or items could make or break how a match goesI thinkas it allows for a lot of strategy and means the player with the best aim or reflexes won't necessarily be the victor In factone of the things I love so much about the game is how accessible it is to so many different skill levels and styles of play If you just want to do the shooty pew-pew thingthere's plenty of characters that'll have you covered there Maybe your aim isn't so good but you have a keen sense of timing and situational awarenessin which case healer might be the role for you Or maybe you just like being a stonkin' great big tank throwing your weight around at the centre of it all There's a little something for just about everyonecreative characters that somehow manage to all play massively differently from one another Both the design and artwork really shines throughand is topped off with great animation and largely top-notch voice acting There's an abundance of detail in every aspect of themwhether it's some little nicks and scuffs on the side of a firearmor even the motions as they actually fire and are reloadedor just the way a character moves around and performs each of their abilitiesor even how they idle There's a real sense of love and attention that's very clear to seeand that extends to every aspect of the presentation both throughout the UI and within each of the many maps as well Andif anythingthis only seems to be getting better as more and more interesting and creative content is being released with admirable and impressive regularitywhile I'm at it) I think special mention has to go to the audio as well Sound is very important in this game as every single champion has their own noisesfrom the sounds of their abilities being activatedto their main weapon being firedto the stomps of their feet If you listen out to what's going on around you then there's an awful lot of information to be found just by keeping your ears open At any given moment you'll likely be able to tell exactly who's firingroughly what direction they're inand probably even how far away they are A lot of players probably aren't even consciously aware of itbut it's always there and making a huge differencemore so than just about any other game I can immediately think ofthoughas the game does have its fair share of problems PersonallyI think the damage feedback is desperately in need of improvement Having the very outer edge of the screen momentarily turn a faint red hardly seems adequate in the heat of combatand at this point I've lost track of the number of times I've died without even knowing I was being attacked in the first place But a bigger issue than that is the matchmakingbut I'm only a few more bad games away from calling it that It feels like it's becoming increasingly hard to get games with consistantly matched players of equal skilland 4-0 stomps are becoming more of a thing lately - which are never funno matter what side of them you're on The rating systemon the other handI think at this point I can call broken In Competitive modeboth your individual champions and your overall account ratings are awarded or docked points based on whether you win or loseand then (presumably) used to calculate further matchmaking as it attempts to queue you up with players of equal skill The trouble with this system isit seems so focused on the bottom line win or lose result and has little bearing on personal preformance As a resultyou could play the best game of your lifebut if you were teamed up with bad playersor someone on your team was disconnected or there were heavy lag issuesthe game doesn't really care and will still deduct you for it It's really not fun when you feel as though you're being punished regardless of your own ability or contributionand as it stands right nowmy own personal rating for both my account and many of my champions are in the toilet despite my consistant above average performances And the worse thing isthat effect only seems to be confounded with timeas it takes multiple wins to make up the points for a single lossdue to recent changesthe grind for new players seems a little rough going Cards need to be unlocked through a random loot chest system or bought with ""essense"" from duplicate cardswhich could take a while and doesn't exactly encourage new player experimentation Althoughto its creditit's nowhere near being pay-to-winand I think Hi-Rez are generally pretty reasonableand maybe even generouswith its current financial modeland some or all of what I've written could be completely irrelevent a year from nowfor better or worse But if it does changeI really hope it will be for goodand that I'll still be playing it and loving it just as much then as I do nowI dont quite know how play this game but when people call me retarded in the chat it help me understand how to play ThanksSummary of paladins:developer badAmelia WatsonAme best ground pounding announcer""Momcan i use your credit card to buy Overwatch?""I still have to give this a (weaker) Not Recommended THE CARD SYSTEM DESCRIBED BELOW IS GONEand the current system is better than everwhich is great Gameplay currently lacks variety (all gamemodes boil down to 5v5 team deathmatch on similar maps)which made the gameplay get old quick for meand unfortunately Hi-Rez is still doing some shady things (eg""forgetting"" to mention in advance that they would change the price of voicepacks from being obtainable with the free currencyto exclusively bought with the premium currency) Daily quests are the main thing keeping me logging inyou might still find a game that you likebut hopefully it helps you make an informed decision FirstI'll try to explain what the game was like prior to this patch:you had three 5v5 PvP game modes: Onslaught (team deathmatch mixed with king of the hill)Payload (similiar to TF2one team pushes a cart down a track and then switches sides after the round ends)and Siege (king of the hillwhere the team winning the hill pushes a cart similar to Payload) There was also a ranked/competitive queue for Siege Less popularbut still around are training versions of each game mode where you fight against botsand custom games which work more like your traditional server browser matches You would queue up for one or more modesthen select your characterand then select your loadout once you loaded into the mapof which you selected 5 to make a loadout Each character had multiple abilitiesand these cards modified how their abilities workedor in some cases the stats of the character (healthmovement speedetc) These cards had different effectssuch as ""reduce cooldown on ability X""or ""increase distance on ability Y"" When making a loadoutyou could choose how powerful you want these cards to beon a scale from 1 to 4 For exampleat level 1 a card might increase the distance you travel when you use a dash ability by 10%while a level 4 card might increase it by 40% The cards in your loadout had to add up to 12 points; for exampleyou could have a loadout with card levels 4-4-2-1-1 Each character also had a premade loadout you could use if you weren't interested in setting up your own loadout When you selected a loadout in matchyou also selected one of three ""legendary cards"" separatelywhich were similar to the basic cards but had only one level and much bigger effectsone issue with this previous system was how you obtained new cards for a character You always started with 5 basic cards and 1 legendary card unlocked for a new characterenough to have a loadout ready to go; howeverto obtain new cardsyou had to open up a loot box that contained all of the cards in the game You were unlikely to get the card you wanted unless you were pretty luckybut any duplicates granted you a crafting currency (""Essence"") that you could use to buy the cards directly The lootboxes were a little priceybut you did receive some from hitting certain XP milestones on your characters and general accountand you could buy them with the currency you earned just from playing the game (""Gold"") Depending on how many characters you playedit could be pretty hard to get all of the cards you wantedespecially the legendary cards which were a lot rarer in the lootboxes and much more expensive for direct purchase (This was never really an issue for me given how much I playedbut it was definitely a bigger issue for new players)and give all cards to you for free They also changed the old loadout system: instead of modifying the levels of 5 cards to create a 12 point loadoutyou instead just select 5 cards that have a fixed level Some are upset about this second changesince it reduces the number of combinations you can makethe change that has probably caused the greatest outcry is leveling up cards Instead of having levels 1-4they are now level 1-10 (now including the legendary cards) When you unlock a new characteryour cards start at level 1 and are pretty weak By level 10the cards are muchmuch stronger A card that increases the distance on a dash ability might given you +5% at level 1 and +50% at level 10 Another card might reduce the remaining cooldown of an ability when you kill a player; at level 1 it's a 10% reductionwhile at level 10 it's a 100% reduction These values are taken from real cards A player with a loadout full of level 10 cards will have significant stat advantages over a player with a loadout of level 1 cards (To play devil's advocatethe previous system probably wasn't totally fair to newer players either: the experienced player had more cardsand thus more flexibility in how they built their loadout It wasn't a perfect system Howeverin many cases I think the extra cards opened up sidegradesrather than straight advantages over other players)and after you collect a certain number of duplicates of a specific card it levels up So many duplicates are required to max out a character at the momentthat even pretty hardcore veteran players (like myself) don't have enough currency to max out 1 of the currently 34 characters At the moment these loot boxes can only be purchased with the in game currency Goldor be obtained from your first few wins in a day Stilleven without a maxed out characterI don't feel comfortable having a straight stat advantage over newer players in a PvP game like thisthose that pay for these services are going to be able to get more lootboxesand therefore level up their cards quicker They have also talked about putting a premium currency option for buying these lootboxes as wella more direct pay to win (1/16/2018 EDIT: Earlier todaythey quietly added an option for purchasing these lootboxes via a currency that can be purchased)all of the above saidPaladins might still be the game for you If you are only interested in the Siege gamemode (the ""main"" gamemode)there are queues available where everyone's cards are set to the same levelboth casual and competitiveaka ""Cards Bound"" Card leveling has no effect on these matches at all You can just set up your loadout and be on an even playing field with everyone elseif you're like meand never enjoyed Siege but did like Payload and Onslaughtyou're out of luck Onslaught and Payload are exclusively available using leveled cardsaka ""Cards Unbound"" (technically Payload uses fixed level cardsbut that is likely a bug) Alsothe developers have stated that any future gamemodes (including the upcoming Team Deathmatch and Battlegrounds) will be exclusive to the leveled cards queuebut I cannot recommend this game to others This is mainly due to the above reasonsbut also a few other problems (groups stomping solo queuersPayload getting removed entirely in OB65bugs I care about persisting for monthsetc)I hope it was helpful If these problems are addressed in the futureI plan to update this reviewi pick the tree and throw the axe and when big number pop up i get the serotoninI've loved this game I've logged so many hours into it and had a

1,"The game is good but the developers are going the wrong wayWorld of warship has reached a new low. Everybody knows that every game companyâ€™s goal is to milk players for as much money as possible. Smart companies do it so that player pay because they are happy. Wargamingâ€™s way is to treat players with contempt. Wargaming demands its CCs to show â€œrespectâ€ while treating truth tellers and players with none. Blatant falsehood during money grab only gets lame â€œapologiesâ€ when exposed.

So if you are new to the game and genuinely wanting an honest opinion on itplease read my words carefully.since the main perks of premium ships is increased credit and exp incomewhich at low tiers is moot as you make profit easily.but you can and will throw a game if you are high enough tier and do not pull your weight.demount a placed upgrade for use in another ship without spending credits and to retrain your commander instantly when placed on a new ship.the better. The number is basically saying that at your maximum range shells fired have a chance to land anywhere in an oval shaped area with a length of that many meters.unless you are playing low tiered battleships that have ass dispersion by design.mind youbut by no means were they as accurate as tanks or sniper rifles. Simply putIf you know how to aim and are skilled in leading and predictionyou can and will have a few shells hit your target per long range salvo. Medium to ideal engagement rangesyou will see most of your shells hitting. Which is pretty realistic if you ask me.That system is less realisticbut it is more consistent.It will shatter and deal no damage.and the shell isn't past a certain sizeit will bounce and deal no damage.the shell will over penetrate and not have a chance to detonate it's warhead inside the target for it's regular amount of damage.HE shells have their own mechanicsbut are even more consistent.Placed in an enclosed map with key areas that you need to take.it is not a sailing simulator. You can and will encounter players at every tier that are playing to win and maintain their stats. Just like any online gameexpect some toxic ingame chats if people have slighted each other. It can largely be ignored.refusing teamworkTeamkilling/damage etc.all content is available to you instantly.this game is absolutely nothing to worry about.but paying players and free players all have to still grind a significant amount. And no amount of premium ships or economic grinding bonuses will make someone a skilled player.Arpeggioor Haifuri. As there have been collabs in the past and some interesting weeb skins and mods available.This game is addicting and you live for the highs of the gameplay. But it's also addicting in the sense of a predatory free-to-play game. The expenses of all the paid parts of the game are INSANEships going up to Â£100premium timeresourcesre-allocating points and equipment. You get so wrapped up that you start rationalising spending stupid amounts of money on a single digital ship. Everything in this game is pressuring you to spend money.but the balance and resultant metas are frustrating and long lasting. That you have to choose between fighting mindless W pressing botsor island hiding HE spamming snipers.HololiveShould start by saying the ""600"" hours logged here is FAR FROM how many hours I have invested in this game. I would assume my actual play time is somewhere between 2000-3000 hours in total (Maybe even way more. I could be so far off on this number.

For backgroundI've been silently playing WOWS for around ~2.5 years. While not a proI consider myself to be an well above average player that has a fairly deep understanding of the game and where it's at in 2021. I've sunk thousands of hours into this game both for fun and in the competitive scene. While I have no doubt new players may be able to pick up the game and have fun for a whilethere are several core systematic issues that make it so I cannot in good faith recommend this game to someone who's looking to play long-term. Here's my thoughts on what the game does goodbadand the biggest reason why I simply can't recommend it in 2021.to the landscapeto the effects it looks great and performs well on many different levels of hardwaremost not are getting released at a very quick pace which is great to combat game fatigueovermatchCV 3D spotting the game is easy to play at a low level but the mechanics are complex enough that even beta players are still learning every nuance and will be for years to come.but I actually enjoy the rate of progression. Compared to something like WarThunder (MUCH slower rate of progressionI think they struck a much better balance of grind vs. accomplishment.what we are left with is a horrendous excuse for a class that (statistically has the highest damagenearly the highest average killshighest spottingthe by FAR lowest death rateand the highest impact in the game by far. They are not fun to playand really not fun to play against. Total and complete failure.they continue to ignore playertesterand community contributor feedback on ship balance. They know it's an issue internallyand the proof is in the pudding. For the last two clan battles they've had 6+ ships so powerful they had to be banned/number restricted. Players have been shouting about these ships for months with no adjustments. There's also legacy ships that have been broken for years and their solution is to simply remove them from sale instead of implementing smart progressive adjustments to existing ships.they released it in a broken state (surprise and that led to a complete reinforcement of the ""sniper BB"" meta (dead-eye. Beyond thatthey made many nonsensical changes that increase the point cost of vital skills. Commander total points was raised from 19 to 21which in it's own isn't an issue. The XP required to go from 19-21 is damn near as much as it takes to get from 3-19. This means that the vast majority of the community will not only never have a 21 point commander (further increasing the veteran/new player gap but it makes it so that few players are acquiring ""elite commander XP"" which can be used to retrain commanders on another ship. They now charge around 500 doubloons (payed currency for the retraining.""Juliet Charlie"" provides [b]100%[/b] resistance to detonation (a completely random mechanic that 1 shots your shipor ""India Delta"" that grants +20% to the amount of HP healed while using repair party. While I think they shouldn't exist in generalI have to note these flag were able to be easily acquired via completely free means of completing missions and reaching achievements in-game like ""First Blood"" (getting the first kill of a game. The last patchthey completely removed the latter possibility. They did so with little to no communication that they would do so (because obvious fear of backlash. The only realistic means to acquire these flags is now to spend currency (doubloonsstraight buying themcoal - which you can effectively buy with IRL money. Make no mistakethese flags are not optional. They provide such a utterly massive advantage over others that you are required to run at the very least the core flags to succeed at a high level. The company has made it clear with this decision that they are okay with obvious forms of pay-to-win and will risk the backlash for more profit. The divide between new and veteran players is already so largeand this is truly the nail in the coffin. For this reasonand the others listed I will be parting ways with this game and I hope anyone considering playing this game competitively/long-term will reconsider. In the year 2021 they do not care about preserving game-playthey just want money. Pay upor watch your ship go up in flames.If you played any other Wargaming multiplayer game you should know already what to expect.I cannot in good conscience recommend it. I played way more than the 200-ish hours before (and after the game went on Steam. Gameplay is fun as soon as you take a couple of hours to understand the mechanics. Graphics are fineso are the sounds and music.up to about tier 5you get the good stuff. It's easy to earn creditsyou unlock new modules and ships every few battlesyou feel like you are progressing and making a difference. And when you're hookedyou hit the wall. Game becomes a grindfest. You need to play lower tier battles just to make credits. UNLESS you buy a premium account. Or a premium ship. Or premium camouflages. You have oh so many options. You can also buy lootboxeserr I mean containers. Or skip the middle men and just buy credits outright with real money.so that's nice. BUTexpect to get hit with enormous amounts of grindthats where ""loss aversion marketing"" kicks in. After all you can just pay and get that prem thingie right now. They really outdid temselves in British Destroyers event - you could earn ""guineas"" to get a premium tier 8 british destroyer. You just needed to get 50 guineaswhich you could earn at a rate of 4 per weekor buy at I think about 0.75 euro apiece. But here's the catch - you could only earn 48 guineas by playing. If you wanted the ship you had to pay something. And I bet a lot of players didn't read the event announcement (extremely long because the event was complicated like hell carefully enough to notice that you couldn't earn all the 50 guineas in game.I'm very skeptical of most of the reviews of this game as a long time player.Cruiserand Battleship all had their rolesand had a good meta game. Destroyers are the kind of sneaky low HP guys that are fast. Battleships are the big slow brawler type. Cruiser is someplace in the middle. The game was goodall the main classes had strengths and weaknesses. Aircraft carriers (CVs existed but were difficult to play and largely ignored.with totally different mechanicsthat basically just ignore what is going on and impose their will however they want.  You can not defend against the class as anti-aircraft fire is basically worthless. You can't out maneuver a CV because their planes are so much faster and more nimble. You can not outplay a CV player whom is not brain deadperiod. The class is so broken if you have anymore than 1 on each side in a gameit simply becomes a nightmare for most of the players. Basically this class doesn't belong in the gameperiod. Whomever came up with the new CV mechanics is smoking moon rocks. Then rather admit the rework was basically just keep pushing them because failure is not an option.the game is structured in such a way to cause to frustration either though limited resources or long grinding in order to get you to buy stuff. I'm not really against this part but after you play a while you will realize how much of this game is aimed at whales. There is a non-stop amount of new shipseven though they are broken and not tested half the timeor special events to get players to spend money on top the already aggressive monetization system.we are talking AAA game cost for 1 ship. There are other special high end ships that require a resource like in XPwhere if you where to buy the XP to buy the ship it would cost $300+. Even after buying a ship then the game still screws youas you need a captain to go along with it. Now if you want your captain to have skills you will either have to play the captain a lotor spend a bunch of money to level them on your ship you just shelled out for. If you want to level them even faster you can buy flagsand camos that give you more captain XP. They also basically doubled the captain XP cap earlier this year to make it even worse.you've played 650 hours how bad can it be?"" Look I've played and had some funbut overall I've had a lot of not fun watching the game continue to erode what I thought made it great in the past. To be fair it could still be a great game but never will be unless there are leadership changes at Wargaming.because that is what it is.go for itbut don't say I didn't tell you.Try itdon't buy.with a gentle learning curve and protected matchmaking for new players. It'll be fun. You'll research new shipsunlock missionsjoin a clan...and then you'll inevitably hit a fun wall. Try being in a match against enemy Aircraft Carriers and having virtually no counter. Try being in a match with a Tier 5 glass cannon Cruiser against veterans in Tier 7 ships that sink you with one salvo. The power difference between tiers is slight to start withand very wide at the top tiers. And this is a game that wants you to be at the bottom of the food chainso you'll pay to get to the top fasteror pay for a Premium ship because you think it will help you. It won't.but driven by marketing decisions and predatory practices (sunk cost fallacyfear of missing out that emphasises corporate greed over player enjoyment (this is bad. It was once fairly balancedwith only the United States Navy and Imperial Japanese Navyand no Aircraft Carriers. But then came GermanBritishFrenchCommonwealthPan-AmericanPan-Europeanand of course Russian. It's a Russian companyand they swear there is no bias. They try to make all nations have different playstyles (this is good but as more ships are added the internal balance becomes more ridiculousso now we have French Destroyers that go over 55 knotsand European torpedoes that travel at over 90 knots!the biggest gunsand fast-turning turrets. We are all waiting Russian Aircraft Carriers to be introduced to see what these apex predators look like. As a general rulethe better a ship was in real life the worse it will be in the gamebecause reality imposes design compromises that paper ships don't. And this is a company that claim Realism is part of the game DNA. Researchable ships are meant to represent a entire classbut Premium ships are marketed to represent their historical namesake and appeal to collectors. The models can look fantasticbut never forget that gameplay comes first and accuracy takes a back seat. Speed and gun calibre may matchbut rudder shift speedsturning circleaccelerationturret traversevelocitypenetrationbursting chargestorpedoesAAand most of all concealment are simply a fantasy. Put emotion aside: you're not buying the real ship (and when I say buy I really mean rent.and the rewards have been nerfed. We now have a Research Bureau for an elite of players who have researched 5 ship lines all the way to Tier 10 to get extra goodies; the community protested because it locks away advantages behind a grindwalland nobody really wanted to regrind entire lines they already spent years on. We are going to get Submarines shortlyto add a fifth matchmaking class; nobody asked for thembut it will help sell new ships so we're getting them and to hell with the gameplay experience. The developers claim that change is needed to avoid stagnation but the community are dropping out from change fatigue. It is no coincidence that the positive reviews you will read are from those with hours played in single or double digits; the negative ones from those with hundreds and thousands of hours played who are passionate about the game and extremely disappointed. But the same people driving these bad decisions are still in their jobsand the money is flowing inand that's all they care about. When it comes to the players the developers always choose the path of least generosityfor their virtual (i.e. worthless stuffbut when players who pay real money for stuff feel cheated they'd rather upset everybody rather than contemplate any compensation. That's who you're dealing withguys.e.g. a complete overhaul of captain skills that promised diversity but only cemented a min-max approach for all classes and completely destroying Cruisers as a viable ship in the PVP game. World of Warships is in a very bad place right nowand that's before entirely new mechanics are introduced (Submarines and Aviation Battleships. Avoidavoidavoid. Uninstalled with a heavy heart because I loved the game when it was fun (2018 was a great year.waitwhere are the anime girls?How to have fun in World of Warships:Everything is money.**THIS IS FOR PLAYERS WHO ALL READY HAVE WARGAMIN LOGINS **Once a great and promising gamenow full of powercreep and milking the playerbase of as much money as possible.or nonsensically implemented mechanics on new ships (new ships = more opportunities of spending money"

that the transfer of props is legal"" Howeverwhich account associated with me is still illegalso why does my account become legal?the game process has fallen behind a lotand I lost the motivation to continue playing[strike]After 700+ hours of the gameI can't really recommend Bless Unleashed in the current stage that I am playing itsadly they still know how to fuck things up[/strike]I will give this game a full review with information before I leaveand that week was the time I enjoyed it most I didn't know anything muchjust continue my main quests and side quests as a Crusader class The combat system was interesting the first time I playedand I kept enjoying on and on until the main quest end This is the time where you'll start seeing the whole picture of the gameclasses and blessings are extremely unbalanced Some people from the player base will disagree with mebut trust methis is a real issue in the game For blessingsnot so muchbut for classes being unbalanced create barriers between classes in the game You have to understand firstthat this MMORPG game is very damage-heavy type of game This means the more damage you can dealthe more useful you are This make all high-damage classes demanding When players are doing dungeonsone of the best meta you can put in a teamis four rangers and one priest You'll deal so much damage it doesn't matter what mechanics the boss hadit'll die before anything happen Classes like Crusader become useless because it's the lowest damage class in the gameand even though Berserker can deal a lot of damageit's sluggish and play too close to the boss to dish out as much damage as ranger or mage Priest is an exception because it's priestyou put a debuff on the boss that let those damage dealer heal from their damage and cast shields so the damage dealing class doesn't diebreath(use to upgrade blessings) are getting expensive already and the currency in the game is hard to earnthe developers made it worst Breaths are one of the essential for you to level up your blessings in the game and the price starts increasing when the player base drops This isn't too much of a problemuntil the latest patch that I played [b]They killed failstacking[/b] You seefailstacking is one of the most important elements for player who's upgrading their gears and if they fail and break their itemit's gonna cost them to buy repair kits to fix it Especially for higher grade itemthese repair kits can start costing a fortune if you're not the top 02% of the player base who is already rich af Now that they removed failstackingwhich can put your gear sucess rate from 5% to 30%-50% if you know how to failstack correctly You can't do it anymorethat means you have to start upgrading your gear from 5% and up if you have a Mythic gear You have to starts buying success rate items and prepare a lot of repair kits to fix your item after it breaks The price of enchanting is so expensive that it's harder for every player after this patch to enchant their gears now Some people can see this as a money grab from the developers because maybe they want the players to spend more money on the gamebut I can't be sure about it thoughI don't believe that the developers of this game know what they are doing This point is concluded from my two previous points The balancing of classes is extremely slowand it's not on point You seesome class and blessings are so weak and unusable that requires changing and tweaking They [b]tried[/b] fixing it but it was not on point at all If I get into detailthings will get too complicated I'll just say thatthe weakest is still weakest and the strongest gets stronger I'm not saying anything more about failstackingthe developers just trashed itgame is unbalanceddevelopers doesn't fix the problem correctlyitems and upgrading in-game is only for top players because it's expensive I don't think this game can survive longso I stopped playing now and I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS GAME AT ALL Thank you for readingbut I kept playing because I still expect the developers to improve their game overtime since I played around release and if it did improveI would change this review into a positive or sothat didn't happened though I revised this review when I had 9403 hours when I quit and I'm not going back to the game again because the developers has proven me that they don't know how to improve the game quality through patches That is when I decided to stop playing and no longer put anymore hours into the game[h1][b]WALLET UNLEASHED[/b][/h1]Wallet Unleashed is an MMO stemming from Korean roots If you're a regular of the MMO genre over the past decade(or even two decades)you'll know the level of expertise Korean MMO Developers have in draining the player's wallets The first several hours you play Wallet Unleashed can be extremely funor just incredibly boring depending on who you ask By the time you reach the later stages of the gameyou start to realize just how much Star Seeds-- which are the pseudo cash currency-- are necessary to really do anything You can earn star seedsyou can buy star seeds from the Lumena shopbut basically everything requires star seeds at some point Like most KRMMOsyou either grind 32 hours a dayor spend thousands of dollars to get anywhere With that prefacedlet the review beginor slower speed to make it seem like it has more impactexcept it just doesn't have the same feeling as landingsaya parryor a True Charge Slash on Greatsword The game's combat is weighty for all the wrong reasonsbut at least the monsters attack slowlyand are very predictableat least with their strong attacks(which makes sense) It doesn't matter if you have 30000 HPor 5000 HP and 85%+ damage reduction to enemies of the same level if they can just look in your general direction and delete you On the bright sidesaid attacks are easy to predict and equally easy to dodgebut if you're not on top of the ball gameyou're probably gonna get clipped and die anywayWallet Unleashed has some serious anti-player progression If you want to get anywhereespecially free to playyou have to do everythingeveryday Do regional quests everydaywin in pvp 5 times a dayhave multiple characters at 30 to maximize star seed gainetc Even thenyou will not compare to the power of the wallet I've spent a few hundred dollars(for better or worse)and it's still hard to compete against those who have spent thousands more(or just RMT'ed) You have to have spectacular gear to do endgame contentor else you fail DPS checksand in PVPif your gear isn't allyou're barely going to hurt anyoneand they'll just delete you in a single hit If you're a free playerit's even worse To sell any meaningful drops that would otherwise net you 100k~~~~1m+ Star Seedsyou need to spend

1,"Worst story in the seriesand best gameplay in the serieswish i could give it a neutral reviewGameplay: B3 > B2pay your employees randy75/10you will like this game The movementthe gunsand the environments are awesome The gameplay is so good it almost makes up for the shortcomingsof which there are many Seriouslythe gunplay is absolutely fantastic!guns are fantastic I always loved finding new guns/shields/relics/etchowever there is also a CON here that I will get into laterand the amount of customization to the skills and abilities is AMAZING! This is easily the most fleshed out skill system in the series and really made me feel that every point matteredwho thought that was a good idea? Almost half the bosses have ""stages"" where they sit there and charge up or whateverand are immune to damage for sometimes up to a full minute in the middle of the battle! Very annoying and really breaks the fast paced boss fightsthe characters were the absolutely best thing about the game! So many memorable peoplelinesand moments In this game there are so few that only one comes to mind while writing this review No Mr Torgue(Wellother than a slaughter mini-game)Lilith is a waste in this gameMordecai/Brick are almost nonexistentno AxtonGaigeKrieg(Other than his voice)or SalvadorMaya is relegated to a plot pointand for some reason Hammerlock is now a whiny baby and not a fearless explorer If you are looking for another amazing villain like Handsome Jackprepare to be disappointed And that leads us into point 3it's not that baduntil they seemed to abandon the plot they had been foreshadowing The main villains are incredibly annoyingbut then things start to change just before the halfway point of the game and they actually become a little interesting! There is conflict and it seemed like the story was going to take a really interesting directionand then they abandoned it The last third of the game is a bit of a slog but it would have been better had they gone a different route for the final boss Overallmediocre villains at bestand other than Promethea the planet stories were kinda boring or uselesswhich is the core of any looter-shooterbut it was really disappointing to not get another good story By the end of Borderlands 2I felt very attached the characters and I wanted to kill Handsome Jack so badly I stayed up late at night just to beat the game! I honestly don't even feel like I want to go back through the story againexcept for Promethea I got it on sale at 50% offwhich I would definitely recommend This is not a game I would pay full price for It may seem like I am really ragging on the gamewhich is fairbut I also think it had a ton to live up to after the fantastic game that was Borderlands 2 When dialogue comes upI role my eyes and shake my headbut the rest of the time I'm slidingmantlingslammingshootingand stabbing my way through hordes of enemieswhich is so much fun I forget about the bad stuff!the story is ass but the rest is fun lolThe weapons feel better than Borderlands 2but replayability is hurt by the weak story and villainsI want to give this game a negative reviewbut I can't; Don't get me wrongits a good game Gameplay is great and in most ways its a step up from borderlands 2 Visuals are awesomeand diversity in locations sure adds to itI have a lot of mixed feelings about this gameso I am going to start with:fucking excellentskills and passives All pretty darn good some issues with end game but that's for latercontroversial I know but I like them They are all pretty cool (Shame they are shafted by awful writing)frame rate (except for menus for some reason) is nice and clean and for the most part the enemy AI seems goodwhile there are some questions about drops and what not most of the guns from green quality to legendary feel pretty good to usea nice portion of the same tastelessbase-linefoul and ridiculous humour the franchise is loved for (This one will be returning in the bad though)it felt like I was playing an upgraded version of Borderlands 2 which is rather what I was hoping for from the main campaignand in many places your actions within it seem to be of no consequencethey utterly dreadful at living up to the legacy of the lovinglyhate-able Handsome Jack Their story as you learn it at the end of the game has no relatability as their upbringing was no justification in any way for their actions or transformation to monsters You have no empathy for them because their motivations are so weak and attitudes too despicablejust oofobnoxiousMary Sueshitty self insert Whoever this character is based off at Gearbox/T2 and which ever moron on the writing staff decided that she would replace a certain favourite character Fire them both please Preferably out of a man cannon at the circus They are clownsguns are goodGraphics are good DLC are goodreally really bad Certain characters are bad Lot of bad voice acting and animationI'd pay 120 euros for a DLC in which you can kill AvaI waited for the Steam releaseso this is a fresh take With about 100 hours in BL1 and 700 in BL2I think this one falls somewhere between the two in terms of qualitywhere once I was solely condemned to using them until I could afford a DPUH & Grog Rarity also seems to have been given a boost; not only do legendaries drop at a more generous ratebut purples are also noticeably better than common stockwhere they used to inspire the thought'awwwhy didn't RNG just give me an orange instead?'with many attempts at jokes falling flat and the reprised characters in general coming across as imitations of themselves rather than the real deal While many lay most of the cringe at the feet of the main villainsI actually find them passable We were never going to get another Handsome Jackand the cringy d-baggery they embody is at least intentional and self-aware All in allit is clear that gameplay mechanics were given the lion's share of the energywith the writing as an afterthought This was BL1's approachso it's only a letdown in comparison to the awesome balance struck by BL2I had to turn my mouse sensitivity up to consistently land shotsmobs are way more dangerous than bossesand to fans of the franchise will probably merit at least 100 hours Unfortunatelyone doubts it will enjoy the lifespan of BL2due to the fact that its story and thus replays are not as endearingI actively play this game with my father who enjoys shotguns The creativity of the different shotguns he can experience and the feel of the weapon have lead him to this summary review: ""pretty good game for 20 bucks"" which is a level above his satisfactory review of: ""it's okay"" when it comes to reviewing entertainment of any kind (gamesmoviesTV)I deeply enjoy the perpetual escort mission that is leading my father to where the danger is and routinely reviving him because he has not figured out how to move and shoot simultaneously To addthe ability to ping the map to call for him like a dog has immensely improved my the efficiency of my communication skills while also helping him see key items and weapons for him to consider (he suffers from progressive ophthalmoplegia)I would rate this game as ""fairly difficult"" due to the necessity of needing to constantly revive him throughout fightsthus massively increasing the longevity and engagement with this gameI would rate this game fairly enjoyable in spending time with my father who is nearing retirementlearning how to play video games and seldom physically visit due to COVID and our geo locations (US to EU)The dialogue writing is literally 2012 tumblr quality but the game itself is one of the best I have ever playedBorderlands 3 really builds off of what made Borderlands 2 a good gamehowever this time around most of the content in the game is hidden behind paywalls The game is full of sleazy ways to get you to spend money For examplethe game goes as far as to constantly send you reminder messages to play certain DLCseven if you do not own them with no way of disabling these messageswhich was a major mistake By the way it's advertised you would assume you would be able to access all the content the game has to offer After allincluded in the bundle is a ""Season Pass"" which gives you access to a bunch of DLCsI found out that I can't even play some of them because THERE'S A WHOLE OTHER SECOND SEASON PASS YOU HAVE TO BUY FOR $30 TO ACCESS THEM ON TOP OF THE $120 I ALREADY PAID FOR THE ULTIMATE EDITION[h1]Borderlands 3 is a good gameruined by the greed of 2K and Pitchford[/h1]FAR MORE than I did with any other Borderlands game I adored both the shooting and RPG elements of BL3I think it's the best in the series I get what I want in Borderlands the most in BL3fun and insane guns The close range explosive Flakkerthe laser pistol Lightshowthe slot machine integrated gun Lucky 7and the gun that shoots fucking burgers are all inventions of madmen and I love them The playable characters are also the best in the series Multiple action skills allow for you to have 4 BL2 characters in a single BL3 Vault Hunter There's no real generic gun man (like AxtonRolandand Wilhelm) and all of them can be played in unique methods Endgame is also significantly better than BL2'sas Mayhem levels don't require an hour long investment and all of them are free to you in an instant A final note that a lot of people are sleeping onyou only have to do a single playthrough per character to experience all the content in the game! Honestly dread starting new characters in Borderlands 2because a max level character entails visiting Sawtooth Cauldron 3 timesthe mini-maps are an actual challenge to navigate due to how they factor in different floor levels and how they constantly rotate The same mini-map will look drastically different from itself if you just move up a staircase and face the other way Alsoit is not my expertise to say whybut BL3 has terrible optimization and even the highest end pcs will experience stutters over very little But the most offending factor of BL3 would be the game's writing The main story has some of the worst writing I've seen in a AAA game Ava is probably one of my least favorite characters from this decade She is a literal child that constantly whines and learns nothingbut for some reason gets the keys to the Crimson Raiders thrown her way And don't even get me started on the Calypso twins Living up to Handsome Jack is a very difficult taskbut they were miles away from ever achieving that Tyreen's motivations are the generic ""I want power for the sake of it"" villain trope and Troy exists for a buildup to nothing If you want a more detailed explanation on the faults of BL3's storyI highly recommend Cartoonshi's video on the topicbut rather the greedy executives as Gearbox devs never received their promised bonuses after the game sold 5 million copies This combined with the allegations of assault and severe underpay from the former Claptrap voice actor really lead me to believe that Gearbox is a talented studio held back by their money-grubbing publishers I genuinely hope Gearbox will be able to stand without 2K somedayit's a very fun game with some flaws in UIoptimizationand writing But I find the toxic work environment of 2Kunderpaying of employeesand the anti-consumer business practices make it very hard for me to recommend anyone to get it 2K is a company up there with EA with their abuse and greed and I hope that less people support themWant to change game language ?right click on Bonderlands 3 -> Properties -> Set Launch OptionDear BorderlandsBungusjust turn the dialogue off and you'll have funSo i preordered Super Deluxe Editionnow i have to pay more to have sp 2?Whats next after ultimate ?Super mega ulitmate deluxe edition?If I had a dollar for every time I laughed at a jokeI would have exactly zero dollar[i] ""I was kidnappedtorturedand served a box of Chicken fingers Chicken was apparently the name of a bandit who displeased the cook"" [/i]and represents the fourth main and fifth overall entry in Gearbox Software's Borderlands game seriesmore enemiesmore Borderlands!

1,"Wtf does Techland think they are doing? Did they miss the memo? You aren't supposed to release a fully fleshed outwell optimized game on day one. You have to fund lackluster development with ""Pre-Alpha"" exclusive monetization and drip feed players the content. As if that wasn't bad enoughthey decide to remain closely involved with the communityreleasing updates regularlyeven while developing another game? These guys are killing the established order of things! How are developers supposed to keep up? Whatare they expected to just ""make games""? That's like giving away money.I couldn't be more proud of these guys.Lemme give it to y'all straightwho are on the fence;the game is very much worth it at full price.that has kept me up until 5 A.M. in the morningbecause of how lost I get myself into it.save for a VERY FEW TIMESand each one counted.so long as you do enjoy it with action.so I can runacross roof topsand attacking zombies while talking to friends.slightly saferand adds a lot in the form of friendly rivals! Single player feels way more tense and everything you do countsmaking you second guess some choicesfor fear or death. Night time in either mode is fun as heckthough four co-op makes it pretty easy.zombies shuffle aroundfalling off rooftopsbeing dumbeasy to avoid and kill. Night time? Get those UV Flares readyand be ready to flee if they catch sight of you.I keep coming back for moreas it's super fun.which also included only HALF of the side missions. Still got a little over 50% left to goand looking forward to it!find friends to play withenjoy the hell out of one of the few games worth it at full price.Glad to see the misinformed reviews have been thrown out of from the top page. For those who have said that Dying Light's day/night mechanic is not what they thought and that time doesn't actually change in the game clearly haven't played past the intro missions. The first two missions are obviously there to get you startedso they're not going to thrust a timed day/night cycle before you get the hang of the environment and the mechanicsand thus in the intro missionstime does not change if you don't progress the quest. Past those two missionsday/night becomes very realand incredibly terrifying. /endRantbut this is what Dead Island should have been. Everything from the parkour to the combat just feels incredibly fluid. Running around is great funand jumping into abandoned houses and exploring/finding loot is constantly fun. And this is where I got caught in my first night phase. I was running towards my objective when ""oh look another shelterlet me go secure it"" then ""oh look there's an air drop nearbylet me go grab it"" then again another shelter nearbyon top of random houses and zombies (sorry""biters"") to lootand before I knew itI got my last radio call telling me I should get to a shelter quick (mind youthe Tower warns runners a few times before nightfall to get homebut I just have to keep scrounging for loot). I checked my map and realized I was pretty damn far from the closest shelterso I just booked it. This is where freerunning gets exciting. With how seemless and smooth it is to run around/through buildings and across rooftopsthe run to my shelter didn't feel annoying or like a chorebut more like a challenge to find the smoothest route (very similar to Mirror's Edge). Long story shortnight fellI shat my pants and crouched my way from rooftop to rooftoplistening to the horrifying screams of the nighttime biters as I eased my way into my little shelter. I've since tried to go out at night and see if I can tackle a nighttime bonus objective of a questand I can tell youas of right nowI am definitely not prepared... but I'm damn excited to finally face the challenge.seemless parkourin my opinionis laughably badbut I began to think that it may have been intentional? And Rahim... he must have played a lot of Jak and Daxter back in the dayall he needs to do is dye his hair yellow. BreckenJade and Lena are among my favorite so farwith Lena reminding me a lot of Cassandra from DA:Inquisition with her hair and accent. Overallcharacters are decentand that's all that really needs to be saidso far at least.and surprisingly undemanding even on my single GTX 970 with everything cranked to max and at 1920x1080. Though many report a huge framerate difference by changing the View Distance optionI can barely see much of a difference in-game with that option set to half or max. The only issue I've noticed is that very very rarelywhen you're fighting biters with melee weaponsthe game randomly hitchesthen continues normally. It only happens in combatbut not often enough to be annoying and that might just be my system. Overalleverything looks greatand the graphics and effects are wonderful. For an ugly gamethe visuals are surprisingly beautiful.but my only comment is that the music that plays when you're outside has one part where a random singer begins to chantand I swear it scares the crap out of me every time. Bashing biters with blunt weapons sounds very satisfyingand you can tell when you've hit the right spotwhile hitting the chest is usually a muffled thump. I've yet to get a gun though (I've spent a lot of time just wandering around so I'm not too far into the campaign) so I can't comment on that. Alsomake a little bit more noise and you'll hear bone-chilling screams in the distance of the more agile biters coming to get you. Very satisfying sound work overall.you'll like this game. If you hated Dead Islandyou'll like this game. If you're a fan of first personopen-world gamesthen I'd bet you'll like this game.I've never been one for zombie games but this game changed my mind!  Below is a review of the single-player campaign (I don't play multiplayer so can't comment on these elements).  Hope it helps you. :)first-person action and RPG) where the citizens of Harran (a fictional place in Turkey) are becoming infected with a rabies-related virus.  Your task (as protagonist Kyle Crane) is to locate research regarding a cure on behalf of the Global Relief Effort.  You join a garrisoned band of survivors in Harran and take on the role of one of their 'runners' (people who carry out the dangerous work of gathering supplies and carrying out other requests on behalf of survivors) as a guise while you try to infiltrate and locate a wanted man and some vital data.open-world environments are incredible - set in the slums of Harran and (later) Old Town - both locations offering a different style of parkour.  Your movement will be a mix of runningjumpingusing a grapple hook or sliding down cables.  Ohand the odd swim!  The parkour is fluideasy and not over-fantasised (it is not beyond imagining that a fit and strong man could perform the moves the game offers).  The campaign itself is of good length and enjoyableand there is a wealth of optional side missions and challenges to complete.the infected and 'virals' roam the streets aimlessly (often in huge numbers) but don't present too much of a danger provided you keep to rooftops and higher areas.  At night thougheverything becomes much more sinister!  Not only are the infected out in greater numberbut a darkeralmost indestructable breed of the infected comes out for the hunt.  They're stronger than youfaster than youand would like dinner with you (you as the main course).  There is no other recourse but to stay indoors and sleep until daybreakor dare to go out and use stealth and speed as best you can.  It's worth it because you'll get double experience pointsbut you might not last too long.  You have been warned!agility and power. You'll earn upgrades by gathering experience points in each of these three areas.  The weapon system is wonderful.  At firstyou have nothing but bits of woodtable legsthe odd wrench here and there - with which to pummel the infected until they die.  But as your survivor experience points ramp upso does the quality and power of  the available weapons and it won't be long before you're one-shot-killing the bulk of infected people.  Weapons can be upgraded with enhancements and buffs as you collect thembut they don't last forever.  You can repair a worn-out weapon only so many times before you must find or buy another in Harran.a HARD mode has been added.  Good luck with that!  For the rest of usI would say the difficulty is at medium level when playing on 'normal'.  You'll be in for some fights and reliance on parkour from the startbut nothing feels unachievable.  There will be enemies that at first will be too tough to confront head-onbut nothing is beyond reach.    At firstI tended to cling to roof tops and would become easily overwhelmed by the infected if I found myself in the middle of a streetbut I didn't have to wait until too long before I was easily able to defend myself and reap all the resources infected bodies still carry once killed.  The only element of the game I didn't enjoy difficulty-wise was the small number of speed challenges (same sort of thing as the speed challenges in Assassin's Creed) but these are totally optional and nothing is lost for any player who prefers not to complete them.I actually found mouse and keyboard much easier for the parkour than my XBox 360 gamepad.  Both are supported and hot-switchable but I found Kb/M more accurate.  Overallgameplay felt fluid and funwith very few frustrating moments throughout the game.but they weren't bad either.  It took me over 100 hours to complete the gamebut on average I take twice as long as the average gamerso expect at least 50 hours of gameplay.  The story was enjoyable without being too predictable (a few twists and turns along the way) and it has left me wanting to replay the game.I only had problems with one area towards the end where framerates dropped and grass polygons were no longer rendering correctly.  Out of 100 hoursthat was about 10 minutes of gameplaybut I'm running the game with a 6Gb nvidia Titan Black on a new 6-core i7so there is a good chance there will be the same or similar problems on anything less than that (caveat: I did ramp up every single setting in the game) so you might need to dial back some thingsbut franklyno matter what level of settings you useyou will still be impressed by the graphics.I didn't much like the speed challenges as they really didn't fit well with the story and were a tad too difficult for bad gamers like me!  Sometimes'trap' zombies were placed purposely behind closed doors with no chance for the player to take avoiding actionresulting in immediate death; death isn't a huge problem (you'll just lose a chunk of experience points) but it felt a bit unnecessary to put these deliberate traps in the game.  Finallythere is a big announcement on-screen about being about to embark on the final part of the game (it's really just to tell you that while the game will end you will still be able to finish off other missions and such).  This totally broke the immersion for me (I would rather the game just flowed into that final sequence) but it's a petty thing reallydemonstrating that there really isn't much to dislike about the game at all.and even at full price it feels like a bargain. Even if you're not struck by zombie gamesif you like a GOOD open-world gameI really recommend it.  A huge thank-you to the developers for giving me a fantastic 100+ hours of quality entertainment!Like zombies? Like popping their heads with gunskatanassledgehammersetc?spent an entire night on a pole because i couldnt make it to a safe house 10/10This is a great game. How often have I not decided to go do this quest a few hours before sundown thinking ""plenty of time"" only on the way to the objective I stumble on some other stuff to dolike this dude that wants help retrieving his fishing rod or something. *Looks at sun* ""sure I can do thatplenty of time still"". Then only 5 minutes before nightI complete the mission and reallize how close to evil night I am. Frantically begin sprinting and parkouring for the nearest safehouse. On the way I find a police van practically unguarded! Knowing how good the loot can get in these police vans I just gotta open it and get the goodies. After all it could be rifle ammoor a new shiny weapon! Im usually not more than a minute or so picking the lock. Done lootingbut oh shit! it's almost 20:00my watch is beepingnight is coming now! A few hundred yeards from the safehouse still it's too latemonsters emerges and I need to slow down and try to stealth my way back. Jumping over a fence I dump down practically in front of a dreaded volatile. Knowing it can rip me to shreds in seconds I flash my ultra violet lamp in it's general direction and decide to beeline straight for the safehouse. Several horrible grows tearing the silence behind me and action music fills my veins with adrenaline as I sprint for my life. From the growls I gather that several volatiles have joined in the hunt. Jumping down into a shallow wide crevice with a cracked concret pipe running in the middle I quickly slip into the pipe and crouch down in the corner hoping no one saw me go in. The monsters are shambling around on the outside with the distinct sound of them breathing. Sounds like air being sucked through shredded meat. But I think they don't know where I am. Then glorious ""pursuit evaded"" message appears. Phew. I now pay attention to the search cones on the minimap and successfully sneaks back to the tower.I'm a 67 yrs old grandma who loves playing this game!! I am not bored any more!!  Love killing the zombies using different weapons and traps! I use to fear the violatileI would run and hide in a safe house as soon as it got dark! Now I go looking for them and enjoy killing them!! I like increasing my levels and crafting my weapons and making them stronger so I can kill the demolishers and other monster! I like doing all the quests! I like clearing the safe zones! I complete the game and go right back inso much fun chopping heads off!!  Now I understand why when I called my boys to dinner they wouldn't stop playing their video gamesyou really get caught up in the game. You always want to finish a quest and the game!! Can't wair for more Dying light games! I'm a lone player once in awhile my sons will join my game. But for most of the time I am a single playerother players are just too fast for me!! They run circles around me.  I love my games!!! I can't wait for the new one looks awesome !!  I played the PRISON it was fun. It has a glitch when I was about to enter the  outside courtyard the violites were able to kill me by spitting their venom through the hallway concrete wall !! I haven't been back since !! It kept repeating!!- ""BAD BLOOD"" GLOBAL PLAYTEST PHASE TWO ON SEPT 1st AT 9:00 AM. YOU HAVE TO SEE THE TRAILER!!  SO COOL !!Releasing free content 3 years after release. These developers are saint. God bless.KEEP IN MIND THIS REVIEW IS GOING OVER DYING LIGHTNOT DYING LIGHT THE FOLLOWING AT THIS POINT. I WILL UPDATE THIS REVIEW ONCE I GET INTO THE FOLLOWING. ALSOI HAVE YET TO COMPLETE THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN WITHIN DYING LIGHT. Ok now onto the review for what I think so far :)but the added features of parkour and freerunningcombined with the large open worldand a fresh feel the often over-saturated zombie genre.and there are very few issues with the movement. The one only area that doesn't do great in this regard is getting up cliffs or rocky areasbut considering that Dying Light takes place in an urban environmentyou aren't gonna be climbing up that many cliffs tbh.where you find what you need to upgrade a weapon in the worldand then can add a variety of upgrades to (melee) weapons such as fireelectricitybleedingand toxicity. It feels pretty damn cool to get a high end weapon and add flame to itso when you hit a zombie it will burst into flames. Guns in this game are relatively easy to come across once you get to a high enough survivor levelhowever it's rare enough that it's still special.then you are kind of an unstoppable beastbut at least it's not a situation where you get a level and go from really weak to tremendously overpowered. For Agilityyou gain points by (as you may have guessed) running around the mapjumping and leaping from rooftop to rooftop. For Poweryou can gain these points from killing zombies and generally doing damage. The best part is that you can get points towards this through molotovsor other zombie-killing devices other than your own weapons. This is a plus because sometimes you are focusing so much on quests and running around to the point that your agility level is off the chartswhile your power level is likelevel 5. The Survival level is upgraded by completing questscapturing airdropsand saving survivors. One thing to keep in mindis if you plan to play with friendsI would HIGHLY reccomend having one save file for yourself and another for you to play ewith your friends. I ran into a situation where I was playing by myself and then bringing my friend into that game when he was available. This meant that he only got survivor rank credit from the quests that we did togetherand so I was a way higher rank than him. Then there's the legendary rankwhich is unlocked after unlocking all the upgrades in every other skill tree. It turns you into a zombie killing tankby increasing max healthstaminaas well as specific weapon damage. Overallthe upgrades are challenging enough and also provide you with enough reason to try to level up a certain skill.and does not seem forced at all. It makes it really interesting for parkouras well as when you are running away from a viral or a volatile.and also new and original which is great to see in the zombie genre. They are super-human zombies (rather ironic choice of words but you ge the idea) and they only come out at night. This makes any situation where you are stuck outside after the sun's gone down really damn intense. Dying Light does a great job making you goddamn terrified of the dark. The other zombies and special infected are pretty genericbut stillwhat those are lacking forI feel like the volatiles make up for that one hundred percent. There are new infected added into Dying Light The Following from what I have seenbut in the base gamethe infected that you encounter in the daytime are pretty damn generic.no problems whatsoever.with lens flare and all other sorts of cinematic effectsyou feel like you are playing a movie sometimes. Absolutely gorgeous game!the average infected you will meet will be more of the same. The volatiles I personally believe help change the entirety of the gamebut still overall the zombies are pretty underwhelming and quickly become an inconvienence rather than something scary within the game.and is very predictable.which makes you quite apathetic towards a lot of people. That being saidthere is one guy (whos name escapes me) that just hangs out beside the elevator in the tower when you ride it up and is likethe nicest dude from the get go. I love that man.if you are looking for a beautiful game with great mechanics player upgrades that you can sink hours into without realizingDying Light is the game for you. Howeverif you are looking for a very story-rich gamethen this will fall short. I personally have had a blast with this gameand playing with friends makes the game just that much better. I would highly reccomend.but who knowsI may do more. Hope you have a fantastic day :)A week ago I was diagnosed with a terminal illnes and the doctors have given me a year at best. I'm so glad I was able to play this masterpiece before I go. I don't know how many people will see this; but I recomend to you to buy this game if you do see it. Gameplaygraphicsrealismeffects... everything is masterfully crafted. Thank you Techland for your gameDying Light is a great gameI could write a really long reviewbut let me just write a list with some points.if you want you can buy DLC. Certain DLC will add a bunch of content again.great singleplayer experience.there is a great atmosphere and it is just fantastic howsome great abilities you can earn and the inventory system works nice.so there is enough gameplay to be found in this game and it will keep you busy for a long while.you just get GREAT VALUE for your money.First couple of hours are difficult considering the lack of effective weapons but after that it becomes amazing. Campaign is predictable and a bit overdramatic but still entertaining. The gameplay is amazing and the parkour system is fun and energetic. Base game is amazing but the following dlc makes it godly. I bought it on sale and got the enhanced edition for $20 and it was super worth it. Truly a good game and deserves more money. We need to start supporting good games like this and not trash money grabbers like the newest cod. 12/10.The best Single Player Zombie experience available in my opinionalong with State of Decay 2 (Dying Light is more polished though). Multiplayer is still quite fun but the Story it's where it's at.challenging but never frustrating""The Walking Dead"" by day""I Am Legend"" by night;but I will say this.in a very long timewhich has legitamately inspired a sense of fear in me.this game becomes a heart pounding nightmare.I love this gamethe best zombie and parkour game of all timeplus there are multiplayer features so the game will be more fun. If you are looking for a parkour game this might be the solution.the best zombie and parkour game ever.cool weaponsa lot of places to explore.climb everything. It's parkour with zombies. Go through a city in rooftops. It's simply great.but not the best around.and I can clearly say that sometimes you'll litteraly cry because of.. laughing so much. By farthis was the most funny experience I've ever had in co-op. There were tons of funny situations happening. You will laughbelieve me. A lot.TL;DRbut the majority of them are the slow braindead typeonly attracted to noise - the kind that can be easily avoided by just simply running a couple feet outside their immediate reach. In generalavoiding zombies is the best way to progressquite different from how Far Cry playswhere it's more of a ""taking back the island"" sort of experience rather than ""working around"" the citywhich is what Dying Light excels at.your main methods of dealing with zombies are all finite resourceswhether it be your melee weaponsyour guns (ammo is limited)or your special crafted itemssuch as grenades or explosive ninja stars (yes how edgy). So the game essentially works off of the risk/reward mechanism of using your small pool of finite resources to loot materials and new weapons from a city that is under siege from undead. The way you be successful is by picking the correct application of your killing tools to loot these items most effectively so that you use less resources than what you loot.Kyle Cranedefinitely ate his greens growing upas the guy throughout his journey will come to be an expert of parkoursoon enough learning how to freerun effectively and fluently around in the city in a way that is supremely satisfying. Know all those cliche ""People Are Awesome"" videos from 2010 where it's just a guy doing super cool jumps across the tops of buildings? Yeahthat's you in this game.while something like a combat knife is good at quick slashes and wearing down zombies with multiple incisions. All of these weapons are animated realistically (I mean I think - hell if I know how to fight with a baseball bat or a knifebut it looks realistic enough!) and they all feel extremely satisfying to swing around and score some kills with. And if using a baseball bat to score a homerun on a zombies temporal lobe isn't enough for youthere's a pretty basic but very user friendly crafting system in the game that lets you add a variety of fun (and sometimes pretty nasty) effects onto your looted weapons. A baseball bat that also electrifies zombies? Surewhy not?Go out at night they saidThe most admirable thing about this game is that the developer (Techland) four years later is supporting the game with new DLC and events. Just like CDPRTechland has proven that there are developers who actually cares about their fan-bases and wants to give them the full gaming experience. For me that is important for a gameto feel like the developer admire their own products and supports them throughout long periods of time.because the reward is extra XP that you can use in the skill tree to unlock new and fun skills. The zombies are well done and even though some can get annoyingI feel like those are important to make the game more challenging. A tip is to play on the hardest difficulty to get the best experience. Also the co-op is fun and if you have people that you can play withthe experience gets even better. Me and my brother has played this game for so long and we are still stuck with iteven though the second one is coming soon this one will always have a place in my heart. The story is intriguing and the side quests are funeven though some are a bit silly. The voice-acting is for me not a problembut some NPC:s could have been ""voiced"" a bit better. Alsoanother well made part of the game is the weapons and crafting. You can make so many different cool things with the weapons and it never gets boring. For me this game is a masterpiece and you should not hesitate getting it if you havenÂ´t already. The music/soundtrack is excitingespecially at night-time. AlsodonÂ´t forget to nominate this game at the awards""The Labor of Love"" is made for these guys!You fire up Dying Light for the first timehaving fun with the parkour and trying out the mechanics of the game.and the sun setting in the horizon.jumping across rooftops with your flashlight ontrying to get into safety.you see [bit[/bthe ugliestnastiest mtfkr on a rooftop. It notices you immediatelyyour minimap glows red with arrows and they start to get closer.jumpingdodgingand finally a safehouse is within reach. Your heart beats faster and faster.adrenaline still fresh in your veins. You turn around to see a swarm of angry fugly predator zombies on the next rooftopjust inches from where you werescreaming at you.and good luck. [/b"

The game is toxic and pretty much unplayableJust to preface this reviewI have bought and played every ""survival game"" for the last like 5 years I've been a server ownermodderand clan owner on a myriad of survival gamesthis game is headed downhill fast And it is not due to a lack of effort on the Devs partthey are doing a great job I think the biggest issue this game has is direction You need to pick right now what kind of game you are going to be This game has all the mechanics and structure to be a great survival gamebut it like all others before it is going down the dark path to being PVP centered You can't stop PVPbut you can design in a way that makes it not break the gameand make all of the other great features irrelevantyou and the other players chop and glitch and disappear entirely And the PVP wouldn't be so bad if you could freely respawn somewheregrab a weapon and get back in the fight But you can't in this game Dying means hours of running and looting just to scrap together enough gear to try again Only to encounter another group of fully geared guys with sniper rifles hittingand I'm not joking I can send you the video on this 1500m killshots 1500m Killshots What kind of survival game needs the ability to make 1500m killshots? And to add to the frustrationyou have to BUY a respawn So then you are out of fame pointscant do anything but random spawn and frantically loot again as you run AGAIN back to your basethen run AGAIN to a bunker or some high loot areaonly to be killed by some douche that logs off in the bunker and shoots you in the back when he spawns in There is so much broken gameplay with this gameand so many things that contradict each other it is unreal Like the metabolism and levels I never look at thatever There is this huge part of the gameand it's a major part in a survival game that hasn't been done like this before But it is rendered completely useless by the fact that people don't live long enough to even worry about it Other than eating or drinking whatever random thing I had on me at the timeI never had a need to look at it any furtherwhere people are trying to scrape up everything around them to survive there is no farming? No gathering of wood and stone to build with? No building? And I know this is on the roadmapbut I think it needs to be made a higher priority The majority of players on the server are solo or small groups that need a place to store their stuffsecurely This lockpicking thing is another issue Whats the point of scrounging all this shit together in a base after spending 100's of fame pointsthat aren't exactly easy to come byjust to have your stuff lockpicked by another crew Is that what surviving is about? Breaking into your neighbors house to take stuff that you don't even need? Like 6 man groups are running around lockpicking everyones houses and taking their guns and ammo They don't need itthey have more than they could ever use And then what is the solo suppose to dostart over at 0 and spend MORE fame points to board up the same houseor another onejust for it to happen again?they will take it There is no way to lock them upand very few buildings that you can actually store them in And if you doit will cost you hundreds of fame points And even thenit can be easily lockpicked and stolen Or you hit a couple trees with it due to the ridiculous handling and squirrely back endand it blows up Want to take it somewhere? Well you canbut when you get out you can't lock it And people will generally follow you and take it Cars should spawn all over the placebroken and in need of repair They should require parts and fuel to run You should have to gather these things up and fix the car to get it on the road It should have keys that you can make for itbut you could take say a shoulder or side of meat and throw it on your back Then when you are back at your camp cut it up Also why is there not just a grill I can make out of metal and place over a fire to cook meat on I can get to the point where I have full military gear and weaponsbut I am still putting meat on sticks to cook it?but at least find a way to balance it Rust has tons of pvpbut you can spawn back in 1 of 10 sleeping bags placed anywhere in the world Dying doesn't cost you anythingand you can have a base that isn't as easily raided to put guns in so you can get back in the fight No looking around for clothes to hold gear inas you have an inventory and everything takes 1 slot They chose the PVP pathand the survival aspect is almost non-existent If people want to battle royale let them play PUBG That is not why I bought this gameand it is not what was promised when this all startedfishingtrapping gamebuilding a place to call your ownpicking herbsmaking medicinecrafting things that actually have a purpose Survival should mean more than surviving going in to a high loot area and not getting shot by another playerthe drone follows them around for a set amount of time showing their location to everyone or have a humanity system where they get negative humanity for killing another player and then loop something else into that like a bounty system Random respawns should be freebut after 1 make it have like a 5 minute timer so people can't abuse it to travel around the map Take out the high end snipers why why would you need that in a survival game? Balance the guns damage and armor rates I got 1 shot full healthfull military gear with a shotgun from 20 feet awaycome on now More hunting gunsless military grade weapons After allin a survival scenario that's what you would find more lying around hunting riflesshotgunsand pistolsand fix the game that you already have  Every itemfeaturetweak you do to the game should be in line with wanting to push the game in a certain direction Right now it seems like the dev team doesn't have a clear end game goal of where they want to beand are just putting in things to try and get people to stay interested in the game with no regard to how it effects the overall gameplay Or if at the end when everything is finishedit will even be the game we all paid our money for Please Please don't be the next Rustor Arma We have those alreadyand they are cancerous PVP games with terrible communities and aggravating play styles Get a clear picture of what the final product is going to beand stick with it Number one because if you are just going to keep going this direction and end up just another PVP gamethen people deserve to know now Don't keep taking people's money and touting this game as a survival game with all these great survival featuresonly to produce a game that is just another PVP killing fieldand the devs have done an amazing job so far But I think that they need to pick a side and stick with it if they are going to be successful If not then it will turn into another H1Z1Miscreatedor Subsistence Great gamesthat went nowhereI am going to split this review into three parts 1) The good 2) The bad 3) What I think should be changed/addedor bandits Someone to set off my alarms and traps or test my defenseseating nice foodreading a bookcatching your first fishcompleting a big build will make the player happy Things like recent deathdeath to a teammatehungrycold/wet makes player unhappy Happiness affects speed and performance No game has come close to being so realistic Why not go for it?or maps to secret entrance to bunkers or tunnelbut would be cool to have an economyin SP have random dead bodies with loot like a crashed carchopping down a tree sometimes you get a bird's nest with eggssometimes you get nuts/fruittonnes of fooda raftand it seems I ran out of stuff to do Looting became a chore and repetitive Life in SCUM became boring I tried giving myself tasks to make it interesting Right now I still like the game but it can be so much better The devs took on a tough route making it a super realistic game which I appreciate But with that it can be boring and hard I think they can add so many things to make it more fun but yet keep the integrity of the game I hope they do Can't waitI can piss and shitshoot whatever guns I wantbuild a cabin and live in the woodsget alcohol poisoning and die  Everything I have ever wanted  Would recommend[b](75)??/10[/b]that's a relief Secondly yes you have to [url=https://steamcommunitycom/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1500333141]puke[/url][url=https://steamcommunitycom/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1502498715]pee[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunitycom/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1501178744]poop[/url] Thirdly it is not another battle royal clone It's more like a DayZ with a larger focus on survival (eg body stats; minerals & vitamins) plus some enemy [url=https://steamcommunitycom/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1502504173]mechs[/url] in addition to the [url=https://steamcommunitycom/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1502498973]zombies[/url] SCUM is an open island survival game set in a near future The idea with the prisoner island survival show is goodbut has to be expanded as well as the max player count of 64 per server The map is really big and as there aren't 200 players on each island the devs put in a special zone for DM/TDMwhich is at least a start for now What you get is a lot of exploringsearchinglootingcraftingfiguring stuff out and some killing besides the pooping - in a [url=https://steamcommunitycom/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1501470981]beautiful looking[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunitycom/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1502499065]shaped world[/url] In total Scum feels like a more accessible and more advanced DayZ in almost every wayespecially when compared to its' early access release For an alphathe state of the game is really good(!)also compared to a lot of other early access titles I played on their release - don't belive the nitpickers Hopefully SCUM will develop in terms of keeping the excitement after there's nothing left to explore (see [url=https://steamcommunitycom/app/513710/discussions/0/1737715419889405829/]planned features[/url])?!

Nahitâ€™s an amazing game with so much potential The devs have delivered a game Early Access that already knocks the socks off most rival games in the genre Its exciting to think of how good this could actually be 6-12 months down the line!

0,"TLDR: Don't play this game. It's fun for a little whilebut once you reach the end game (lvl 40+) the gear grind is tedious and progression is heavily gated by both time and RNG.dimensional portalsairship dailiesand clan war.house customizationa garden to manageand nice things to craft with the resources you grow/collect.which can be unavoidable during raid boss activities.player xp levelitem levelskill attributesrunestone levelsrunestone attribute levelstokensrankscollectionsachievementsand more). While some may say more progression systems gives more things to dothese systems are convolutedclunkytediousRNG gatedor all of the above.such as instant revive scrollsdeath XP recovery scrollsstorage/inventory space (a necessity if you want to play the game seriously)""Star's Blessing"" game subscription which gives you more XPhigher item drop rateand several other advantages over F2P players. These things add up to a pretty significant advantage which many will say is P2W.you are limited in how much time you can do that activity each dayand converselyif you despise an activityyou will have to suffer through it every day if you want to progress.this game is similar but the combat is not as good as either. The game engine (Unreal 3) is very old and the game itself looks old. Seriouslythis game looks and feels like it's been around since 2012. If you're looking for something fresh and exciting with very modern graphics and engine capabilities that can take advantage of modern hardwarethis game is not it.The reason elyon is losing players is because its mechanics literally waste your time. You go to enhance something and it breaksand it's ""see you next week"" but quite literally because of the time gated currency system. I'm pretty sure the probability rates are fake. I have 300 hours at time of reviewbut it's possible someone with 100 hours has more gearscore than me because of luck. At least BDO had failstacksbut this has become more like a job than a fun game. If you value your timewould not recommend elyon.Headstart Player / KR Player here.

You want to clear dungeons to bad you get only 4 every dayyou want to do quests you get 20 ""Quest letters"" every dayyou want to do some gathering your AP (Action Points) limit how much you can gather per day.if you want to farm gold/items from mobs you have to use a boost that gives 10x drop rates.Honestlyit feels...oldfor a lack of better word.The gliding is nice and I suppose some skills look alright.The gameI'm toldopens upbut it just ain't my cup of tea.naturallyI'd keep that to myself and just leave the game alone-BUT-this is kakao and I assumed they learned their lesson when it comes to anticheat solutions...nope...xigncodeup there with my most ''beloved'' anticheats-It's just software I don't trust and guess whatjust like BDO used tothis game won't remove this for you if you uninstall it.unless you aren't as paranoid as Iyou'd want to remove that;to save you the searchremove that...and thengo play with regedit a bit- open regedit by typingwellregedit in your windows search baropen as administratorgo ctr + F to open the search options and enter xhunternothing less.Reboot.You're done.Not surethere may be more garbage to cleanbut I'm gonna be digging right about nowI had fun up untill level 43 360 gs slayerthe slayer class is extremely strong if not straight up overpowered so i slaughtered people in pvp and loved but the enhancing system is just absolutely worse than torture. its rng on top of rng on top of rng sprinkled with RNG. As someone who loves pvp mmosi just can't spend more years and time of my life blowing items up like i did on black desertbut it's even worse than that. Don't play this game.There is some review from the guy who play almost all mmos. At firstsorry for my english.thisone is pretty good. Same as AionTeraArcheageBDO...for me the quests are boring in every single gameso...so yesmany hours of killing mobs if you want to xp fastbut you dont need toi will explain under.good fast action combat. It`s still early gameso other classes seems strongerbut it will be different in late. For example Slayer in early is pretty strongin late-late game he sucks...well it`s deep with many optionsonce you understand it you will propably like itbut it`s very RNG - againit`s Korean mmo...but you can easily farm them from example pioneer shop - just do blue airships quests. Yes you can buy bigger crafting material bag - i dont have it and i never feel like i need to buy it.you can buy many luminious/pets from market and try to fuse your main luminious/pets (same as BDO)but the RNG will fck uyou will fail and lose your money. If you successthe boost from luminous/pets are not crucial. For meis better to farm it ingame.let's take a look what you can do daily and tell medo you have so much time:depends if you go party or solo. On party it take 05hour for 4 runs - but depends on partyhard to say. For meis OK because 4rewards per day is enoughit getting to be boring after 1-2runs...where you can obtain 30min of daily dimensional extenderso you can do 15 daily dimensional.so basicaly you would do 1-1.5hours of weekly dimensional per dayif you have mats you can craft them afk because it takes some timeand it takes 1hour5-1hour5-7hours content per dayand its fun because you do many different things. It`s not only gathering and crafting simulator...there is a plenty XP booster what you can get and just go grind.which gives you more things to do per week.which is pretty fun if you have chill pill guildmates.the game is not for everyone but it`s still F2P with no really P2W. There is much more p2w games on market. You should give a try to this gamethere is not much others fresh mmos...Very enjoyable until I crafted my first piece of gear and then went to upgrade it and it broke and disappeared. Hours of farming and crafting down the drain. My time is too important and limited to be spending hours on nothing productive. This single game mechanic ruined the entire experience and I won't be playing anymore.Jiggly realistic boobs.Nearly didn't pick this up because of the bad reviews but so far I'm having LOADS of fun. I have been playing a lot of FFXIV this year but Elyon is much more suited to my play style. New World did not suit me either.so ignore the naysayers.release gameI'm sorry to say that Elyon is just not very interesting. When TERA (another Bluehole game) was releasedit was very revolutionary for its time: an action combat MMO with great look and feel. Elyon actually feels like a step backwards -- the combat is not as impactful or interestingthe engine performance (Unreal Engine 3) is really poorand the game is mostly focused on grinding or somewhat pointless PvP.but unless you really enjoy repetitive gameplay I can't really recommend it past that.the animationsthe combatthe monsterseven the QUESTS (which are TERRIBLE in TERA) are better. To make matters worseTERA has better performance! Elyon is a giant step backwards in every single way.My personal review on Elyon as a level 44 Gunnerread below.everyone that plays ELYON is from TERA...classes are so confusingwarlords and mystics are oneshotting me being defensive/healing classsesslayers are just broken in all aspectselementalists have such low range for a good amount of their abilitiesand PVP was just thrown into ELYON without any regard for balance or consideration from PVE into PVPElyon is an mmorpgthat offers a lot of different stuff from other mmorpgs while also implementing ideas from other games. It's made by the Developers of Tera and you can definitely feel that.not P2WDISCLAIMER: DO NOT BUY THE WAYFARER PACKAGE AS YOU GET IT F2P BY PLAYING THROUGH STEAM! (TLDR is at the bottom)as all other items (minus inventory and storage expansions) can be earned easily through gameplay.in a timed instance for PvPvEor in RvR. Take the KR version guides on builds with a grain of salt because these devs appear to want balance on this game different.the same combat functions and names for soft and hard cc mechanicseven a cluttered UI. However keep in mind that this is originally a Korean MMO and its what you would expect from one.you are better off looking elsewhere.even mob farming can drop gear however at the moment your most reliable source is farming mobs. There are numerous tokens in the game which can be exchanged for pieces of gearhowever most are considered to be 'breakthrough'.strictly because of the effects that the runes provide.characters can swap out their skillsaugmentationsrunesand even their mana passive skill tree for free. There are even presets that you can save for skills to switch to certain builds or even change from PvE to PvP focused builds. Equipment can even be unbinded by purchasing unbind scrolls from NPCs.daily quests are given in the form of permits. 1-3 permits are used to take a daily quest and some of them take a while to do. A separate instance which only allows you to be in it for 1 hour is primarily used to farm mana awakening xp for your mana passive tree. AP which is used to gather on the field and use some housing gathering items comes back slowly. They are per characterso dedicated players can use multiple characters to maximize their farm per day.as there are only certain areas or content where you want or have to use gliders. If you have a groupyou can take to the skies on an airship for aerial specific dailies/combat.as they are tiny rodent like creatures. Orcselvesand humans are basically the same with hairstyle differencesvariation in faces and muscular properties. Sliders are everywhere as you would expect from a Korean MMO.and once you pick one you are locked to them FOREVER. Coordinate what faction to play on with friends otherwise it is impossible to party up with them. Hopefully this changes in the future.starting guides from the KR version apply here too. Leveling and gearing tips are the samehowever class differences along with best and worst classes are at the moment different. Play what you want.Iâ€™m only 5 hours inbut Iâ€™m having fun. Iâ€™m not sure who wants this thing to fail but they are really hammering it for some reason with negative reviews. Iâ€™ve not seen a game where so many of the reviews are completely ignorant.- PvP battlegrounds with random modifier (I am baffled to say the least)This game is pretty fun until you get to around Level 43 and 400+ gear score.PVE combatexploringand lifeskill economy is much better there.Not exactly what I expected. Suredisappointing in some ways but blowing my mind in others. So many ways to customize your skills! While lacking in gear varietyearly mount (and flight wings) are a definite plus. But what does this review matter Its F2Pso just give it a shot.Really bois You wanted to ask money for this It does not even come close to tera first versionthe WHOLE game has like 10 NPCS merchantsall with same name and same appearanceattention to detail is no where to be found. Story and leveling is not cursiveyou end up needing to grind mobs for hours just to be able to level up and do the next questscontent is lackingif you play slayer! Let people farm dungeons wtf is this trash to have only solo dungeons until lvl 40 and at lvl 40 there is only 1 ( ONE ) dungeonwhere is the content bois What is this "
1,its okcube go jumpthis game is way better than fortnitePlayed for a bitquite addicting I should say.You beat all the original levels and decide you are ready to go onto something harderyou beat 30+ demons till you finally take a step towards your first extremewithin 2 weeks you get 50% on the level and you think you are going to beat it soona week later you have reached 80 percent and can almost grasp beating your new hardest. Everyday you tack on hours and hours dedicating time you didn't even know you had to making a square jump over spikesone day all your practice comes to fruition and you die at 96% on the level. NINETY. SIX. PERCENT. You have become so obsessed with this achievement to where the game almost doesn't feel fun anymoreevery hour of every day you think about how you could be and should be beating the level. it's hard to concentrate on anything else as this little square consumes your mind constantly. Then one night while talking with your friend in a callyou do itafter over 30000 tries you let out a massive yell of YES!!!!! Victory has been accomplishedyou have powered through hours of misery to click for 2 minutes straight without dyingthe thing that consumed an uncountable amount of time in your life is overyou did it. FuckI love this game.I like the part where you jump in this game :)This game is great! :Dbut hard to master. DIFFICULTY what does the touch of a woman feel likegamecube go bounceOne of the most versatile level editors you'll find in a gamethis game is an art form at this point lolhAfter over 1000 hours and multiple hard demons under my beltI can say that I love this gamenot everyone will though. It requires a lot of patience to beat demons but the excitement and happiness you feel when you do so is more than worth it. I will be the first to admit I have raged hard at this game due to dying at 98% on hard demons but the adrenaline and how it gets your heart pumping makes me keep coming back! Overall I'd say if you're up for a challenge buy this gameyou'll love itbut if you don't like games as hard as this give it a pass.MaybehGetting Geometry Dash was the best decision I have ever made. I have done way more than any person should in this game and it was worth it. I made so many friends through this game. I can't even imagine where I would be right now if I just never played this game. Overallnot a game meant for everyone for sure. But please give it and what it has to offer a chance. That's all. Thank you RobTop :)just jump and u dont die{Graphics}I HAVE NO LIFE
1,"The hardest part of this game is convincing your friends to playI know this is just a hypothetical situationbut let's say some rampant disease was preventing you from being able to play board games with your friends WellTabletop Simulator would be your hero10/10 It lets me play a certain tabletop wargame without spending 1000 dollarsPerfect for when you're in a COVID-19 quarantinebut still crave board gamesI have been highly sceptical of TTS for a long timetokensand rolling dicehanging around with friends  ""Thanks but no thanks!"" I thoughtI was wrongI realised how TTS is not what I thought it was  It is not a collection of games whose rules have been coded in an algorithmit is a physics simulator for the top of a table  The fact you use that table to play games on it is almost incidentalyou still get to roll diceshuffle cardsmoving tokens around all while chatting merrily with your friendsthis brings me to the top 3 pros of this game for me:cleanupscoring)I discovered many more games that I fell in love with and of which I have now ordered the physical copy (that I would have never bought of my own accord otherwise)as that is the only computing platform I usei can play warhammer and pay child supportDon't make the mistake I made of getting it with no one to play withHave you ever used a table? It's like that*Warning Wall-o-text Incoming!*making it my ""main game"" of sorts I had taken a pretty big hiatus from most other games because It kind of lacked fulfillmentgetting tired of grinding on a lot of MMO's I distinctly remember someone in the old group saying ""oh yeahTabletop Simulator I bought itflipped the table over and overand threw stuff aroundthen closed it out after 30 minutes or so""and how anyone considering buying this needs to know this isn't just a physics sandbox This game alone has made me realize how much tabletop gaming has comeand how much it has evolved from ""My cousin always beats me in MonopolyUNOetc""MOST of the games will be locked You won't know how to play most gamesand most public games will be simple things like Uno or Blackjack If there is one thing I could fault the game onI feel the community as a whole should allow a lot more spectating of advanced gamesthis is the only nitpick I would have The real magic of this game is made apparent once you visit the workshop You have virtually every single board and card game at your disposalTwilight EmperiumTicket to Ride?

the DLCs are functioning gamesbut the main ""game"" is merely a physics engine designed to work with a tabletop situationthanks to workshop contentyou will have just bought almost then entire boardgame market when you purchase thissince all workshop content is freedon't forget that you should support the games developers - without themyou wouldn't get any games at allbut it's an excellent way to play stuff you own with others online without having worry about things like covid getting in the way of your fun Also an excellent way to play games which otherwise have a single use (such as Pandemic Legacy or similar campaign games which involve changing cards physically)it's really straightforwards to just swap control back and forth while you play Howevernot all work so wellmotor controls are somewhat more limited (or advanced!) in a simulator - games where fine placement is required can be a bit annoyingas can games requiring a lot of passing stuff round or the like That being saidit's an *excellent* environment for games which require a bit more work in real life - rulersstraight line drawingmarking thingsapplying multiple small objects on the boardetc it is even better than real life gaming and can be completed much faster - and some good LUA scripting for games can automate a lot of otherwise irritating or time-consuming processes on a real version of a game (such as counting up pointsetc)though for any more substantial interactionsyou'll want a basic understanding of LUA programming to build upbut if all you want is the physics engine and to shove some tokens and a board image togetherit's very user-friendly and easy to create something fantasticI wish someone had made this tool to do something!' chances aresomeone already hasand their servers can play up at timesbut it does have a good autosaveso the host will have a save within the last 5 mins if there are problemsusually allowing you to replay any issues should they occur -

though be cautious if your computer is in the low-end of the price range as the LUA scripting in some board games can choke low-end processers The main thing to remember is that the games are only as good as the person who scripted/made them -

1,"Im a 46 year old dad and I absolutely love playing this with my 13 year old son.  Dont get caught up over losing loot to a raider or reaperits just part of the game.  Let your kid set the questor decide to attack a fortor a tornado and just have fun being pirates for an evening.  I take the helm and keep us on coursehe works the cannons and is an excellent shot.and a great way to talk about how to not be a jerk onlinehow to deal with disappointmenthow to work as a team when you make alliancesand how to be a gracious winner.  He loves to help new playerswill upend a planned evening to help some newbie finish a tall tale.  Great game to play with your kids.1720s Wages2020 Prices.Dont know what went wrong during developmentbut this is not a game.My crewmate left a banana on the stove and our ship burned down.Well after reaching Pirate Legend and Athenas fortune Champion titlesI hope it will help you decide if this game is worth it! Ill probably update this review the further I play. For now Ill be talkin about the [b]Adventure mode[/b] :)but youll learn so much faster in solo trust me.quick reactivity on problems in-game through their tweeterso I would recommend to follow them there to not miss a thing and to always be aware of whats happening).XP and achievements).we are lazy and hate to go through google to see our fck in-game event progressionjust put it in game already ffs its 2020).so if you like intensive farmingbugscoop and pvp but also the big map youre in the right place. Well be waiting for you on the ocean :)thats what I do and I would have loved to be helped too when I startedso please do so they will always remember youthanks fellow Legends.the game is still awesomeprobably one of the best open world in multiplayer that Ive played in a while. Nothing better but to fish with friends during late nights.joined a competitive team and reached Legendary Sea Dog. So the Arena mode is way different from the actual game (adventure). It also have its pros and cons so here we go :theres only one chest now and its way better than beforeso sometimes youll need to hit 3-4 time the player before he diesand sometimes you may think theyre cheater)the playerbase is not that big hereso you might wait 10-30min in the worst case...This game taught me two very valuable lessons in life: Dont trust anyone and have a plan to kill everything that moves.Edit 12/2 - Its been a while since I first wrote thisso adding an update section at the bottom.grab some supplies with your friendsload up your shipand set sail to see what fate awaits you.and the second is that you dont mind when it all goes pear shaped.sailing from island to islandfighting skeletonsghost shipsdigging up treasuresolving riddlesdelivering cargoand fighting sea monsters. And you never quite know whats going to happen next on your adventure. Theres plenty of things to chaseand youll never be without a task for long if you care to pick one up from one of the vendors.theres no progression between sessions aside from cosmetics you unlock. (Which is also the only thing you unlockmore on that below). While this can be a bit of a bummerits actually quite freeing. Every time you launch the game youre given a new shipnew suppliesand an ocean full of treasure to explore. Trulyyou have nothing to lose. Until you find treasurethat is. Then you have something to lose. The game is simply fantastic at giving you a unique adventure every time you sailsolo or with friends. And its shockingly easy to play solo if you desirethe smallest shipthe Sloopis very solo player friendly if you wish to be an asocial pirate.you guessed itmore cosmetics. This makes the cash shop a little weird. But heythe upside is that nobody is going to beat you because they have a better swordshipor guns.but youre not missing out on anything exciting by not getting the pass.I felt it was time for an update. OverallI still stand by the original reviewwith the same disclaimer that you have to be able to accept the wins and losses both in this game. It certainly can be frustrating at times but much like the shipyou have to let it roll off you like water. If you let the bad moments cling to you like barnaclesthen youll be just as scuttled as your ships.and after a middling Season 2Content Packed Seasons 3 and 4Season 5 could be called the quality of life season. Theres a decent chunk of new content (though nothing like the previous seasonswhich is a reasonably high bar; 5 story missions in season 3and roughly 8 or so new explorable lootable areas for season 4?)but they also decided to add a buried treasure system! Indeedyou can bury your treasure to create a treasure map. Thenyou can put that map up on the quest board at any outpost! Other pirates can take thisand if they successfully sell your treasue...boom! You get rewarded too. How fantastic is that?the days go quickly in the sea of thieves)and these other player maps will contain buried treasure of their own. Of course. Quality of treasure may varyas it could be anything. Though there are commendations to encourage bigfruitful treasure maps. Reallyits a box of chocolatesyou never know what youre gonna get.you lose your maps and need to recover the bundle. Or that other people could steal your maps. Or you could steal their mapsI guessif youre a jerk. While the idea that you can lose your treasure maps may feel a bit unfortunateits lovely design because it means theyre transferableyou could gift the map bundleor simply leave it at an outpost when youre done for someone else to find. It adds excitement in that the treasure you buried could be yoinked by a boarder and carried away. Or that you could recover your stolen bundle to regain your rightful treasure. It adds another layer of things for pirates to bicker and barter overand it means that should things go bad for all involvesthe treasue may be lost to all.its something we must learn to accept). Rememberthe whole ocean is open to youso long as you go in with the attitude that what happenshappens.Sea of thieves is fun for all ages. Im 36 years oldmy parents are in their 50s and my children are 10 and 12; we all play Sea of thieves. The graphics are gorgeous and the environment immerses you in to the pirate life. The game has story line aspects with its ""Tall Tales"" or you can get voyages to kill off Captain skeletonsbattle skeleton and ghost shipsfind lost merchandise in sunken ships or good old fashion treasure hunting. There are ""world events"" that rotate throughout the day this includes skeleton fleetsskeleton fortsfire tornadoes that spawn in ""boss"" enemies and the infamous ""Flameheart"" and his ghost fleet.so you are able to attack player ships and vice versa. Plusduring your voyages surprise attacks from megladonskrakens and even a skeleton ship can attack. This game keeps you on your toes and wanting more. I highly recommend it!I learned french from people in this game.and not fall to this bait again.i stole someones banana and got shot to deathHoly shiiiiiiiiieeeettt this game is nice.did the tutorialfound all the secrets from tutorial (there are plenty!!!).I take questssearch for lootmy boat gets raidedeven if its empty.My boat gets raided 3-4 times in the process.I go to the boatand insidethere are cheststreasuresand some random dude talking.helped me do quests and all for the price of an Uber (get them to a location). They were AWESOMEFUNNY and HELPFUL as hell. Best pirate experience with them.I did several questsI ran from other players as they were chasing meI managed to DEFEAT another ship in a 1v2 situationstole their lootran awaysold itit was epic.the PvP element is awesome!.too bad I dont have any friends playing this masterpiece.as I havent had bugs or unpleasant gameplay.2080S + 4790K1440pMythical graphics (max)100 fps. Amazing!2nd gameplayI finished first 3 Tales and it was a ""good"" gameplay.sometimes by solosometimes by gang of 3-4. But I adapted quickly.3 chests with 9 gold itemsa crying chest and 2 regular treasure chestsall from farming/voyage). I went to an outpostI did a 360 to make sure theres nobody therethen docked the sloop. When I went with the first chest of 3 skullsthere was a dude hiding in a bush next to the Bones tenthe jumped outgave me a heart attackthen took a shot at me. He missed the shotI dropped the chest and I went full ape on himkilling him. Then I ran to drop all my treasurescause since he didnt have a boatmeant his team mates are circling around. On that run I felt like moms spaghettipalms were much sweatyyy...I managed to cash in ALL my treasuresand THENthe bad guys were aready at my ship. I saw them trying to ram it in the rocks. I throw 2-3 blast bombs and they drop in waterthen I shoot them down with the pistol. Managed to get back in my shiprepair itand went full speed into their big shipwhile they were respawning. I didnt stay to repair mineI just shot their ship downthen ran away.twice from crew of 4once from a duo on a sloopthey put a barrel on my ship and sank it downwhile I was doing a quest ... and once from the freaking krakenright AFTER I FINISHED A TALE...  Lost a lot of treasures including the Tale treasurebut....I saw a crew of 4 againprobably same guysthey were fighting a skeleton ship. I got close and managed to spot 2 of the 4 guysconfirming it was the crew that gangbanged me (i think ^_^ ) . I went to themflanked them and placed them between me and the skull ship. Shot them 3-4 timesthen with a singing/dancing cannonball and a fire cannonballand their ship started to sink and burn. I saw them jumping in the water. I went there to see if they ""need"" help and just finished the jobshooting them in the water. Then I took ALL their treasureswhich compensated a lot over my lossand went to a safe outpost.I lost some battlesbut also won a few. First gameplay4 hours2nd gameplay10 hours straight. The PVP element is priceless in this gameotherwise it wouldve become boring.mermaids skeleton lords and kraken :))most of the players Ive encountered in the last days are simply apes.I run fast at outpost and manage to sell every treasuresail awaythey chase me for 10 minutesuntil I stopped to see what they want. They simply killed me on sight.my ship is emptyI tell them ship is emptyand that Im going on a Talethey simply sank my ship.I have +10 skulls9 gems10 treasure chests. I see galeon with 4 peopleI avoid itI run to outpost and manage to sell everything.they simply start chasing me. I tell them I am soloship is emptythey start firing at me. I do a handbrake 180Turnrun against the windsomehow they catch me sideways (AGAINST THE WINDthey say sloop is fastest against wind). They hit me with hooktake me away from my shipin the middle of the ocean. I respawnthey are in my shipburning it down.WE THOUGHT YOU HAD LOOTSORRY WE SANK YOUR SHIPSORRY WE KILLED YOU 3 TIMES"".2 of them were LEGENDSI am a fucking bamby learning the gametwo of them have +500 hours in game.they chose to chase a 1-crew Sloop with no fucking loot.I get to think this game is filled with low ego real life underachievers... for ganging up a fking solo.since theres no fun in getting chased every 5 minutes by crew of 3-4 people that have nothing better to do than bullying a solo player with empty ship.in solo modeI managed to make almost 80K Gold in one gameplay and only lost 1 treasure chest to apes.it was surprisingly amazing. I joined as usualas a solo Scoopbut I forgot to set it to Private. After about 5 minutesI get a random crew member who scared the living thing out of me... lel... He was a legendhe was very funny and helpful. For some reasonhe didnt mind playing with me and helping me do tales and treasure hunting. I believe I wanted to play for half an hourand ended up playing a 8-hour session with himtalking about the game and telling jokes and chilling at some  ""grog"".2v2 and 2v3which sometimes went goodsometimes went to shit when we fell of the ship and they stole our ship and sank it into a cliff.but I can surely sayyou cannot play ""just a half hour session""... 4 sessions ... 30 hours... that says it all.By the time I write this review I have 740 hours in this game. Ive done pretty much everything you can do around here and max leveld all the companies.especially the sea. Characters do look goofy but thats not a bad thing.make it more expensive or decrease the loot you gain.there are 7 emmissary companies in this game. They will give you quests and bonuses on the items you sell if youre sailing with their emmisary flag.tea etc.they will buy it. They buy everything. They dont give you any quests. There are a couple items that you can only sell to them. Reapers Chest and Reapers Bounty but beware these chests are cursed and their positions are revealed on the map. So other players may see you. If youre flying reaper emissary flag they will see you. BUTif you reach level 5 emmisary you will be able to see other emmisaries on the map to hunt them down. You get really good money for selling broken emmisary flags of those people you sank.you can see us on the mapwere up for some pvpcome get us but they raise it to get more money from the items they sell and just keep doing pve.they will be toxic to you naturally and you will deserve it because you made them waste an hour chasing you down.you also get a unique cool flamethrower skull that you can sell for 10k. Not bad.people will try to steal it from you. This is the number 1 event every server hopper can dream of. Its the main attraction for pvp. Really the most fun thing to do/steal in adventure mode.PVP. It gives you a pleasure that other pvp games cant. Its just a really unique experience battling it out as pirates. I dont even do any pve anymore its all about pvp.but oh boy its beautifully complicated.anchor turningadjusting sails to surprise your enemy. Having a good captain will make all the difference between winning or losing a battle.regular cannons to put some holes incursed balls with million different (and very useful) purposesfirebombs to put their ship ablazeblunderbombs to damage players knock them back from repairing. and in my opinion the best type is the chainshots to knock their mast down. Because soon as youre unable to moveyoure done. You will just be sitting ducks for the volley of cannonfire soon to follow. Having a good gunner who hits their shots in good sequence will make all the difference between winning and losing the battle.the other crew member will continue putting the pressure with cannonfire and putting more holes. They wont be able to really focus on repair while they have an active boarder.as fun as it istoo much boarding can be the downfall of a bad crew. Disorganizedif you send too many boarders and they either miss the target or die without doing significant damageyou will be severely undermanned in your own ship to survive the enemys cannonfire or boarders. Ive seen people just all abandoning their ship with holes in it to board ourswe just kill them and theres nobody left to repair them. Come on people. Take care of your ship. Your ship must come first.you gotta play it with friends. x10 more fun. Solo sailing can be painful and usually gets boring really fast.I asked a enemy ship for a banana and they gave me one.helps me forget about herTo quote a friend:Didnt understand the point of this game when I first started.

Then it was 100 hours. 250. 500. FinallyI told myself if I could play 1000 hours of Sea of Thieves by my anniversary in the game (Nov 25th2020)I would write the review. Here I am delivering that promise early. Sodo I recommend Sea of Thieves? Yes. 100%. Absolutely. Sea of Thieves is not only my favorite game that I am playing now but has quickly become my favorite game I have ever played. Amongst my crewthere has been a joke that Sea of Thieves is not a gamebut more a lifestyle. If you fall in love with this game like meyou will fully understand what this means. But is Sea of Thieves right for you?doing X marks the spot mapshopping island to island in search of glittering gold. Suddenly while sailing to Crooks Hollowthe water turns black. The Kraken. The next day you could be running Reaper chasing another Reaper into the Shores of Gold for an hour and a half for what turns out to be a f*****g ancient goblet. The adventure and story to be told is yours and always unexpected.Megalodonsor the fearsome Kraken. There are world events like forts where you fight through waves of skeletons to claim a vault of treasureAshen Winds where you fight a fiery bossand skeleton fleets that have you putting your naval skills to the test; howeverthere is always looming the possibility that other player pirates might have their eyes on that same treasure. It cannot be avoidedyou will run into other players in Sea of Thieves. (PvE servers will never happen.)or events that cause you to break your keyboard. I have met great friendsamazing communitiesand some of the most saltyhomophobicand racist individuals to walk the planet. I donâ€™t want this to scare anyone though because the number of good encounters far outweighs the bad ones. If you do have a really toxic encounterI highly encourage clipping the events and sending a player report into Rare (their support system is one of a kind).it is much more enjoyable with company. My crews and I have had such incredible and epic adventures that we will reminisce on them months after they have happened. With friendsyou will write your stories of gold and glory. On the other sideI am also a player that enjoys the solitude of the seas and will solo sloop. This play style hardens you to the game and will make you a much better pirate. Beware thoughyou will sink. A lot.but you will also sink. No one is immune. Sea of Thieves can be a rough gamebut if you get good at the gameit is one of the most satisfying feelings possible. Everyone starts somewhereand you as a new player will probably end up sunk a lot while you learn to â€˜get goodâ€™. Do not lose faith you sweat lord in training you.then please move on. As mentioned beforeRare does not mess around with player reports. I have had two really horrendous encounters and on both occasions the crews were suspended fast (the last one taking all of 3 hours from submit of report to email saying they were suspended). I will find youand clip youand report youand then hunt you down until you leave the server. That is a promise.nay artI have ever seen. I dare say the in game water looks more beautiful than real water. There are times that my crew is slightly intoxicated and just staring into the sea as the sun sets below the horizon. I have never taken so many screenshots and clips than I have in Sea of Thieves. Your pirate might look a little weirdbut you will grow such an attachment to your pirate that it becomes a bond. I love my strangely long torsoed old man pirate very much.or the Devilâ€™s Roar with its active volcanoes that rain ash and molten stone onto unlucky ships. You may also go and take a break in the tropical paradise of The Shores of Plenty. Alongside the main map are areas you can only get to by doing the â€œstory modeâ€ Tall Tales. The world of Sea of Thieves is rich and alivewith water that thrashes your ship around and shifting winds that require you to maintain your mast position to travel faster.players may find themselves firing shots or landing strikes that do not cause damage to their targets. While small improvements continue to be delivered during our regular updateswe are continuing to investigate and identify further improvements to improve the player combat experience.â€ Expect to see this forever.and Sea of Thieves is not spared from that. I have been rocket launched off a capstanhad a meg flip my ship six tiles North on deathbeen stuck in emotes to crewmates (this one is actually really amazing). You will rage and cry with laughter at some of the bugs in this game. Beware to Steam players thoughevery other update seems to cause a tab out delay bug where if you tab out/inthere is a 3 second delay each way.and you will learn from the times you get sunk. Never give upbecause there is no other game like Sea of Thieves. It truly is the best game ever made. As the Great Pirate Lord Ramsey saysâ€œItâ€™s not about the Gold. Itâ€™s about the Glory.â€ May the wind be in all your sails.000 Day like?000 Day on the Sea of Thieves brought me. My crew mate and I sankand got sunk. We encountered toxic playersand angels. We tried to lure out some spice by doing a Fort of Fortune. Upon finding a tucker in a barrel on top of a water towerwe performed an incredible kill by feigning ignorance while â€œsearchingâ€ the tower as my partner got a sniper shot ready for the blunder bomb that I delivered after (he was a great sport about it all.) He came back once and after a great fightwe sank him. At the end of the nightafter depositing our karma crates on the pier of Golden Sandswe noticed a brig coming to sell from an Ashen Winds event. We scuttled our ship and hid. They turned out to be the most incredible kids who loved the game (one of their â€œbig bwudasâ€ introduced him. Awe!) We emotedthe kid gave an amazing toast in the tavernand we let them shoot us out of the cannons while we logged midair. I canâ€™t express how amazing and truly wonderful this game really is. Be a good persontreat others with kindnessand rememberon the other side of the pirate is a person. Cheers!Ah manwhere to begin!whimsicalcharming. Paired with the fantastic water effects and the day/night cyclethe world feels uplifting from minute 1. You can practically smell the crispsalty air...and then spend the next 100 hours living your best piratey life.you dont level up your weaponsskillsor ships abilities. The changes are purely cosmetic... and I love it. While Ive enjoyed games that require you to level up your gear or unlock movesthis style feels much more comfortable. YOU get to decide if you want to invest time in a quest chain that unlocks a new item (a cool ships liverya flashy new hat)but you arent penalized for being a newcomer. Yesthe fancy canons look nicebut they are just as powerful as the default canons.which leads to unlocking better paying gigs (aka Voyages) and cool-looking items. This works to the benefit of everyone in your crew: A sailor who has a higher rank with a specific Company than their crewmates will be able to pick up a better-paying Voyageand then everyone in their crew can participate. I love this-- if you happen to outrank your friends/crewmatesyou can offer to buy that Voyage. Some aspects of play require everyone to be on the same page (ieTall Tales)but thats ok. Means you can have a positive experience doing one-off Voyages some timesand other times hunker down and work toward longer gameplay arcs.but only recently bought the game. Even though I missed a massive gap of updatesI dont feel left behind. I love going on adventures with my friendsor winding down the evening with some solo-slooping. I live in a different timezone than my crewwhich has meant I have time earlier in my evenings to invest in the pre-adventure prepwork (gathering supplies for the shipfishing and cooking said fish so well have extra stamina). Its funand is surprisingly soothing.I try to avoid conflict. When Im with my crewwe meet it head-on! Both dynamics are enjoyable: Being stealthyhiding behind mountainsdarting around the mapversus gearing up and letting the cannons fly...! So good.and I come from a WoW background. For methis feels like the best parts of WoW: You can tackle massive monsters with your friendsyou can choose to grind for random achievementsand you can spend as much time as you want getting sidetracked by treasure and exploration. Plusthe outfits/livery options...! Since the outfits and ship details are purely cosmeticyou can mix and match to your hearts content.you find yourself getting lost and spending hours NOT doing the mission objectivesbut have a better time for it.for the buccaneer in all of us.Sunset sailing while playing Bosun Bill with all 4 instruments is on another level manIm telling you"
1,"Lmao There are gigantic companies producing multiplayer games that cost hundreds of millions of dollars for development time and marketingand this $25 early access game about mining and killing bugs as a dwarf is the best co-op game I've played in yearsthen bought another round of beer that made us explode forward like rockets So we were all flying/exploding around the space station while sharting and yelling ROCK AND STONE to each other while techno played from the jukebox at the space bar We then threw our mugs at each otherkicked a bunch of barrels into each others facesslapped the fuzzy dice hanging on the dash of the huge drill drop pod thing you go down ingo out into our cave and immediately die from a gigantic detonator just to go back up and get drunk all over againIf ever

gunner fired his minigun from the doorway as I (the engi) tried to get turrets up just in time to take down the Patrician bug coming up the ramp which then released gas into the entire spawn chamber on death forcing us to leave right in to a chasm where one of us went down to fall damagethis game is the kind of game where you see your allies have torches on their armour and say ""Heyhow do you turn the torch on?"" only to find your torch was already on and you've made the situation oh so much worsebut it costs gold so you better have mined some You can also call in a giant sentry gunwhich is handy when you're suddenly told a swarm is coming But not so handy if you want to use that gold for a floodlightif you dream of digging and delvingif your beard is longer than your hair then this is exactly the game you're on this page to find Greed and Gold are king here and you'll go back into another nightmare soley because you want more credits to upgrade your gear I've never seen a better execution of what it means to be a dwarf in a sci-fi settingyou mineyou make moneyyou call the driller a whale-piper for drilling into you by mistake and you yell ""DONKEY!"" for a box on legs to come

of its surfacebruised and bloodied as you areyou're elated that it's over and as you return to the half-mined vein you were working on beforea peaceful calm once again descendsand you continue on your wayonce again the picture of a happy dwarfThis game replaced Left for Dead 2 AND Borderlands 2 as me and my housemate's go to co-op bonanza It's that goodI can't recommend this game enough  This is an actual coop game where the strengths of all can lead to some truly sublime gameplay  When every player is using the strengths of their character you actually feel like a teamnot a gang of random yahoos competing for individual glorymine resourcesdefeat a bosscollect eggsrepair stuff  Each player has a unique rolethe gunner has a big gun and a ziplinethe engineer can place platforms to help with resource collection and has 2 turrets to help with crowd controlthe driller is able to drill through the environment and the scout has a reusable zipline and can light up the environment  Along the way you collect minerals and gold to fund upgrades to weapons and buy cosmetics  There are always resources to find and collect  It's an important point to note that just collecting the minerals feels satisfying and rewardingthey nailed this aspect of the gamethat is when a swarm of enemies attackand then you have to defend against a seemingly endless stream of enemies  In this regard its very like L4Dbut there are more enemy typeseach with their own weaknesses and you need to learn how to deal with all of them  The environments are procedurally generatedno two caves are the same but they follow general patternsthe same applies to swarms  There are special enemy typesthe first time you encounter a bulk detonator your first instinct is to run and it's well founded but after a while you learn how to deal with them yourselfevery mission has a ""hazard level""ranging from 1-5  If you aren't wanting to change your underpants then maybe go for a level 2-3 missionor if you wore your official DRG stone panties that morning maybe go for a level 5  The hazard level changes the amount and difficulty of enemies (your own personal character level also has an impact on thisas does the number of players in a team)so you get to choose what you feel comfortable with but with higher levels comes higher rewardsyou can level up each charactertheir weapons and kit  Each weapon is well designed and fits with the theme of the characterfor example the scout is not designed to take on swarms so his weapons are weakas a scout your movement is your biggest advantage  The gunner is designed to take on swarms so his weapons are powerful but his mobility is limited  There is also a bewildering array of cosmetics that you can buy (with resources you get while playingno microtransactions here!) so you can customize your character however your likethe replayability of the game will go up although I enjoy the game playing just for its core mechanics of collection and combat[h1]Deep Rock Galactic is my favorite shooter at the moment[/h1]horde-based combat of Left 4 Deadand the class dynamics from Team Fortress 2 The game is all about going into a cave and completing one of the various primary objectives while fending off waves of four-legged enemies Upon completing any missionyou're rewarded with goldexperienceand crafting materials used to upgrade your respective class If any of that sounds interesting to youI would highly recommend picking this up The developers are always working on new updates and are really active in their communityso I have high hopes for DRG's future2 secondariesand 3 grenades to choose from What might sound like a fairly limiting choice of weapons at first eventually opens to a pool of dozens of more guns with the introduction of overclocks The basic grenade launcher can be transformed into the Fatboy from Fallout or into an anti material rifle that's practically hitscan The Scout's SMGs can shoot standard bullets without any overclocksbut with them you can make it shoot explosives you detonate or mines that freeze enemies that step on them Your revolver can become a discount sniper rifle or a toxic explosive weapon There's dozens more ways to modify your gun and almost all of them are viable As of this momentthe next update is adding 4 new primary guns and I'm really excited for that And I hope they add even moreas the guns are a major selling point for meyour support and movement tools are nearly the same for every character While the engineer's turrets are highly modifiableit'll always be a turret The Driller's C4 can be built to mine minerals or for purely combat purposesbut it will always be an explosive at the end of the day Something I really appreciate about DRG is that the dwarfs are balanced around their mobility rather than their specifically defined combat roles You don't want a Driller just for his great crowd control You want him for his ability to create bunkersshortcutsand the ability to carve the area into your preference Engineers can use their platform gun to create bridges or makeshift cover This type of balancing allows for all classes to fill a role in any teambut it doesn't feel like a requirement to have one class in particularbut they are there nonetheless I don't like how the game heavily encourages focusing on one class due to overclocks being unlocked once you promote any dwarf The early phases of DRG should encourage experimentation especially since the low level classes are basic and fairly linear with their dwarfs Alsowhile primary objectives are extremely varied in your goalsyour secondary objectives all boil down to grabbing a certain item The hub world is fairly empty as well The only real thing to do is the barrel minigamescrew around with the jukeboxand upgrade yourself in various ways The spacerig would greatly benefit from more additionsespecially a shooting range to test out your loadoutsI really like DRG and I think Ghost Ship Games deserves all the support and praise they've gotten from it[/b][h1]Rock and stoneto the bone! [/h1]DRG is intended to be a co-op experienceand as a teamyouâ€™ll face a wide variety of aggressive aliens (even one that explodes to turn its surroundings into gold!) while completing one of a few different types of missions ranging from mining operations to extermination missionsyou get down into a caveyou explore the cave and complete objectivesthen you leave What makes DRG special is the fact that the gameplay is incredibly tight and rewardingand itâ€™s combined with superb procedural map generation and four very diverse classes With my current 34 hours in the gameIâ€™ve never had the same experience twice and only very rarely have maps seemed familiarthereâ€™s also voice comms but you donâ€™t need to use them unless you really want toit never feels like a grinddonâ€™t worry if none of your friends have itwhy does this need to be a thing? The two heavy classes in particular deal a lot of AoE damage and I found it kind of frustrating to be accidentally damaging or getting accidentally damaged by my team [/list]tight core gameplayand a good amount of all-around variety and youâ€™ve got yourself one hell of a game See you in the cavesbrother!please check out my other reviews over at [url=https://storesteampoweredcom/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner[/url]I should have written this review a long time ago alreadyDeep Rock Galactic is objectively the best co-op game on the marketand there are several reasons as to why that's the casethe whole teamwork aspect boils down to simply damaging the same targets as a groupand that's it Some games let you revive downed teammates while in other games there is no down and revive mechanic Some games let you share resources or loot togetherbut at the end of the daythere really is no teamworkeach with four class-unique weapons and two class-unique tools These class tools are what enable teamwork in DRG; there are ziplines that your entire team can useshield bubbles that protect your entire teama platform gun to build bridges and other defensesheavy-duty drills to drill escape routesstairways and passages through the map There's also one particularly teamwork-effective duo in DRG which is the engineer-scout duo Engineer shoots a platform underneath a hard to reach mineral and scout uses their grappling hook to get onto the platform and mine the minerals I must add that the balance is so perfect that in a 4-group you will usually want one of each class rather than two or more of the same classKilling Floor 2 and Borderlands 2because they're all very famous co-op games that I'm familiar withwhile repeating the same objectives that always interrupt your gameplay because each objective is one of the two; either run to a specific spot on the map or hold F to interact When all you want to do is shoot coppersthese interruptions are obnoxiousand it gets tiresome to replay the same missions ad infinitum Killing Floor 2 is even worse in this regardbecause the maps are all very bland and samey and instead of getting tired of mission-specific dialogueyou are always pestered by the same exact dialogue regardless of map In the case of Borderlands 2 you're always replaying the same story and thus hearing the same quips and memes over and overwhich gets boring over timeeach of which ask you to do something differentbut for the most part these objectives either never interrupt the gameplay or they actually enhance it Two quick examples being Mining Expedition and Egg Hunt ME is a really simple and straightforward modeyou need to mine a specific valuable mineral until you have the required amount and then you can escape It never interrupts the gameplay because there is downtime between enemy waves during which you progress the objectiveand when the waves come in you can fully focus on that In EHyou're tasked to dig out a specific amount of alien eggs and extract While the execution of this objective is very similarthis objective enhances gameplay; each time you dig out an egg there's a chance for a new enemy wave to spawnthus directly enhancing gameplay with the objective itselfBL2 and KF2 In each of these three gamesyou have hundreds of guns to choose frombut none of them feel different Surea shotgun feels different than an assault riflebut comparing assault rifles between assault riflesthey don't feel different Typically the way I describe these games is that for each weapon type you have two real weapons: A high damage-low firerate weaponand a low damage-high firerate weapon If there's 30 weapons in a categoryit's always those two archetypes with minor adjustments packaged in a different weapon modelalong comes DRG and changes that entirely Instead of a few hundred gunsall you have is 16 gunsand each one feels completely different from one anotherand the weapon modification system lets you completely change the functions of any weapon you're using A great example is Engineer's PGL grenade launcher On the surfaceit's just a typical noobtubebut on closer inspectionthere's a complex variety of usage types; you can turn it into a railguna nuke launcheror even a rocket-jump launcher This is all in addition to the whole low damage-high damage thingand limited mask customization you'll only see while waiting for players to join you KF2 is much the samebut in addition to gun skins there's also a massive amount of ridiculous and over the top character accessories that don't fit the theme of a zombie horde shooter at all In the case of BL2the customization is limited to picking a 'outfit color set' from a limited selectionhatsaccessoriesarmor typesbeardscolorsit's insanity There's a massive amount of cosmetic character customization available absolutely freeand in addition to thatthe weapon customization is the best that I've seen in any game I've played;

Likereaaaally like them?this is a game just for you!Did you like & play  Minecraft Tekkit?I thought this was going to be a game only about optimizing your factory in an essentially sandbox environment What I got was a rich game with a very well designed alien world to explorewith subtle messages about environmentalism and the beauty of nature contrasting with the efficiency of machinery  There are literally breathtaking vistasvast beautiful cave networksimpossible alien landformsand completely on point music and sound direction  The slightly sinister feeling nature of your FICSIT overlords lends some deep nuance; what are you actually doing here? What role are you playingand who are you serving?but I'm not one to overdesign to get thereso my bases end up having a naturalistic ""base camp"" feelwhile my friends are building towering factories with rows and rows of machinery I'm really glad to saythis game supports both playstyles fantastically I see my friends having a blast designing and organizing monolithic black cubes full of layers and layers of machinerywhereas I love spreading out and nestling my machines in with the trees and cliffsand possibly animals that caretake and develop their own resources as well This might not be the game for thatand if you're also wanting to see an alien ecosystem spring to lifeI highly recommend Subnautica HoweverI can't deny the intentional design I feel in segments of this game Collecting power slugs to me feels like collecting Missile Packs in Metroid They are usually placed in areas that have a similar challenge feel to themand are a wonderful reward for exploration  I can't wait to find out what Somersloops and Mercer Spheres are forbecause they provide such an intense incentive to explore that I think is missing from some games like thisparticularly with enemy AI It's very rudimentary and when you master kiting enemiesthey don't provide that much of a challengeeven with the Xeno-zapper  It's only when they congregate and team up against you that they feel like a challenge  On the other handthat complexity is used to great effect in the placement of hostile mobs todayso I can't knock the simplistic AI too much because it combines and scales difficulty fairly welldespite the somewhat limited toolkit for designing these encountersplacing the Space Elevator is a religious experience I don't care how jaded you areit's a masterstroke of technology that that sequence plays out so organically and dynamically You really *feel* the scale of the structureand it changes the skyline foreverI often find myself hitting the number row to switch my in-hand equipmentonly to remember too late that those hotkeys are for your building toolbelt  I'd love a way to switch between modeseven if it just means holding shift while pressing a number gets the build mode quickbarand just pressing the number equips a new item to your hand slot  On the other handthere are some very nice Quality of Life touches that I appreciate once I've gotten used to the quirks of this game  Actually placing buildings is decently streamlinedand I appreciate the way building off of foundations allows for a very granular angling Once you're started building a foundation to fit the areathe 90-degrees snap-to-grid functionality feels very useful  The only complaint I have here is the sometimes janky feeling of trying to get conveyors to snap together It can be very finicky about what counts as a valid angleand the feedback isn't always clear about why a conveyor can't be constructed ""Encroaching others' area"" ends up being a somewhat frustrating exercise of shimmying things around in minute ways just fiddling to get the lines all connectedthoughthe game is beautiful enough to warrant the price tag I don't just mean graphics specifications and technical aptitude The design of the game's assets and their placement creates spellbinding beauty The way biomes flow into each other feels extremely organic and immersiveand I've never seen transitions so smooth in any other game It feels like it surpasses Breath of the Wild in this respectand some of this may be because setting this on an alien world helps smooth over any strangeness in geology or botany that would subtly break immersion otherwise  There are so many systems in this game to become familiar withand the tech tree feels so rewarding and rich that it compels me to develop more and more  All in allthis is genius design Mad respectIt's all fun and games til you have to walk 3000m for some coalJust spent the last 9 hours building a 4km pipeline for crude oil It was pointless to spend so long making it look so goodbut it gave me a sense of achievement and completion"
1,"i am 77 years old and i spend all my days playing this game More i play more it's interesting Iplay  on 3 screens with a logitech steering and paddles I choose auto transmission o both euro and american and I can say it's really niceThis is the first time I've ever left a review on Steambut I had tothe amount this game has gotten accurate is nothing short of impressive I have since hung up my keys and live my days retired from the lifebut firing this up with some noise cancelling headphones and hearing the engine noisesthe turn indicatorthe trafficthe air brakesall of it takes me backlike how if you try to GTA ityou have increasing fines but IRL you flat out lose your license and face jail time lol I'd rather focus on what it DID get rightthe way they increase really makes it so if you do try to GTA ityou'll eventually start spending more money in fines than what you get from the load Making it so that your profit margin increases dramatically for safe drivingquasi crazy the second oneand perfectly safe the third time I noticed that I made more profit with fewer deliveries by driving safe So while the game can't take away your CDL for constantly running red lights and scraping the side of a carthe fact you just simply can't make a profit unless you drive safe was a nifty implementationbut I'd rather be playing it right now I tried the demoimmediately pulled inbought it on saleand once I really experienced itI didn't even question buying all the available DLC and now anxiously awaiting the new statesmake sure you put the entirety of Dallas under constructionforever Make sure no one ever uses a blinker And make sure any shippers in Laredo have trailer yards so small that even the most skilled driver/gamer can't park a damn thing in it because they just simply can't moveI hope -I- stay alive long enough to see that lol I would love to hop I-40 from Barstow clear to WilmingtonNC Or I-10 from Cali to FloridaAs a former trucker with over 18 million under my belt i got this game last night becaused i miss the road   It is almost like the real thing  the trailer responds exactly like it does in real life and yes i was able to put in the dock on here just by using my mirrors   i highly recommend it because if you ever wanted to be a trucker this is about as close as you can get to it without actually climbing into the cab and drive itI'm a disabled retired owner operator trucker who is unable to drive cross country now I really enjoy the realism and opportunity travel virtually to places I can't go to thanks SCS and Steam for all the hard work to bring this to usI retired in 2017 and the next year I bought this game to meet a minimum shipping requirement online It was a great choicethis game fits my requirementsWhen I first picked up ATS's older brotherETSI got it heavily discounted while drunkthinking ""Might be fun to ram cars off the road"" 5 or so years laterI got my Class A Commercial Drivers Licence because of these games The first time one of my friends saw me playing thishe thought it looked boring as hell I didn't think he was wrongbut I told him to try it for himself He got his CDL before medue to its deceptiverelaxing nature This may be simply a gamebut it's ramifications can be life changingas a truck driver myselfi find that ats is the best truck sim out there i had to retire at age 31 because of bad health i miss driving so much that this game is the only way i can ever get back in a truck its super fun and very well put together  iv already told people about this game and most said they will check it outWonderful gameI've been here before Or not?"" or ""one more clover highway spread sigh"" while in ATS it's always something new wherever you go And you feel the warmth when you come back to familiar placesrelaxing and enjoyable Not too boringnot too extreme ETS2 has very sharp and plentiful turns Whatever you prefer Personally I love ATS You still get enough turning off the highwayin the city or on narrow roadsless often by cameras So you a) have to look around to see if there's police nearbyb) you have to watch your speed and current limitc) you can decide if you want to keep your money or pay a lot for a questionable right to break the laws Wanna be a rebel? Go ahead =D  Overall it adds to the gameplay very well Surprisingly well I hated speed limits in ETS2they were stupid and cheaply fined and mehless for fast simple onenone for just ditching the trailer at arrival Small bit but also adds to the game scoredepending on my mood ButI must admitI love ATS more It's an upgradeafter all ^__^it's time consuming and may be boring But it's not the game's faultfor sureI just received my real CDL license This game actually helped me do my backing up for the DOT test I built the same truck and trailer and passed with flying colors as it taught me what to look for on the actual maneuvers/I was going about 100 mph on a freeway and had a school bus spawn literally right in front of me The kids on that bus are now with God and my truck is toomy daughter bought it for my birthday i used to be a truckdriver but got to old for the medical test to passI first saw ATS a long time ago when I watched my son playing it but wasn't keen to be a driver here while I was driving for real Would've been too muchalthough I was really interested and helped him with turning and reversing and stuffalways haveit's a passion About a year after I retired I got the urge to keep the passion alive so I started a Steam account and my son gifted ATS to me as an early Christmas present and I've been driving here since Oct 2016take a load somewhere and experience the sunrisesunset and the great scenery I've done a lot of real life night driving into daylight and when it happens in the game it's so real I yawn and feel that special tiredness you only feel when daylight breaks and you're still behind the wheeleven though it might only be two in the arv at my place I'm always thinkin about when I'm goin to be drivin next and what I'm gunna do""Are you comin to bed yet?"" I say""I'll just drop this load off and I'll be there"" Then a couple of hours later I hear""When are you comin to bed?"" and I say the same thing again and hear""You said that two hours ago"" That's how it is and that's what it does The best form of addiction I could ever recommend My personal opinion? ATS - It's a lot better than going to bed!Why did i get this game???So i wondered what it would feel like driving a big tractor trailerAnd so i got this!I can't say if it's anything like a real truckBut this game does get very very complicating when it comes to parking with your 53' containerAnd it makes me wonderWow! Those guys must really have some good practice! Because if i can't do it hereI for sure wont be able to do it in real life! xDDriving next to other truck drivers and then honking at themor meeting new friendsSOME actually truck driversand then traveling with themStopping to weight your freightgetting gas and suchIt's a very fun experienceBecause I feel like i haven't played enough to experience any problems or bugsBut the game is very fun!! ***ONLY IF YOU LOVE SIMULATOR GAMESIf you don'tThen maybe think twiceBut I enjoy simulator games*** And if you want to give this game a try as your first Simulator gameThen i would recommend it!I recommend it to people who want to give Simulator games a tryThis is a perfect one (Or Euro Truck Simulator) Although if you're from the USA i recommend this oneBecause Euro Truck Simulator has different driving rules than USSo you might get tickets for some things you don't know lolIt's 2am in San DiegoCa You just picked up a double of graveland it's your job to get it to Carson CityNV in one pieceor two pieceswhatever It's your first doubleand you just bought a longer truckso you're on edge as you snake your way through the narrow corridors of the miniture representation of Southern Californiapraying that you took that turn wide enough to avoid that stop light You finally make it to the highway on-ramp Traffic is pretty heavy for this early in the morning Luckilya tour bus stops in the middle of the highway and lets you merge Weirdbut appreciated none the lessas you snake your way through California You put on some music to fill your ears with something else besides the low rumble of your Pete Suddenlytraffic in front of you comes to a halt Thankfully for you and your fellow commutersyou kept enough space between you and themand quickly pressing on the brakes brings you to a rather abrupt stop You see flashing lights ahead of youandis that a plane?

1,Fall Guys is a  chill and fun game  but it really needs server improvementsworkshop map creator and more mini games!I gave a little Hug to a playerhe stared back at me for 5 seconds and then jumped off the map and killed himself and never before I felt as much power as I did up to that momentI'd reccomend it so much i'd buy it for youyou can hug peopleWhen I was a little boyI liked to see the Wipeout on TV I always dreamed of taking part in itIt's nice to have BR that's just about having fun 10/10 would fall againæˆ‘æ˜¯å‚»é€¼Here's what I see in this game: potential Is it the best designed game out there? No Is it the best multiplayer game out there? No Is it the best optimized game out there (at least at the time of writing)? No But what it does have is an amazing base game that's incredibly addicting Even for the $20 its selling forwhich in my opinion is a bit highit's still a fantastic game that is incredibly fun to play with a group of friendscustom matchesthe lack of mapsactually being able to use your own name (lol)and the crackdown on cheating (to be completely fair I haven't encountered any) If you're skeptical about the gameI wouldn't blame you for waiting for it to go on sale or waiting until more content is added We've seen this song and dance before: games release with a bare bones experience that's wildly funbut gets old fast That being saidI hope the developers continue to make this game better and better Cut them some slack toothey got flooded with a player base they couldn't have expected Let them get back on their feet after the floodgates openedand show us what they can doI'm having a ton of fun so far but it's got a bit of a ways before it's really amazing 8/10Fun in short burststedious in long stretches (at the moment)Block Partyor Perfect Match need to always end based on eliminationsand they need to be faster and harder as right now they are so easy they are a choremaking your random chance even lower Fall Ball is also incredibly common because of it's flexible player count requirementand I'm absolutely sick of this minigame These are the worst and need to be their own game mode separate from the other game modesFall Mountain is a race where more often than not the person in the lead stays in the lead because there aren't enough factors to mix up player positions Royal Fumble is basically luck based depending on whoever in the cluster****  manages to grab the tail within the last 5 seconds Hex-A-Gone is actually really good Make these better by transferring survival games here and making them progressively faster until only one person is left standingbut since things are repeated so often many of the maps feel like a chore The number of levels increasing is likely to become the case as time goes onbut at the moment it Fall Guys biggest problemand there isn't enough of variety or customization options for costumes to really make you unique and stand out Every Gordon Freeman costume wearer looks the sameexcluding the face colorregardless of your pattern or color Againthis will hopefully be fixed as more content is added over timebut because of how much fun I had playing it and how much potential it has for the future I think this would be a good game to support and maybe play in moderation right now If you think the repetitiveness of the maps will be too much for you then hold off for now The goal is to have this review become outdated simply by adding a substantial amount of new minigames If this goal is achieved I genuinely think this game might become one of my favoritesStop grabbing me I'm trying to winIt's such a great game Had fun while playing BUT you need to get rid of the cheaters ASAP!PLEASE!The Devolverland Expo led me to Fall Guys  I was a little reluctant to get involved in a Battle Royale style game as I generally suck at competitive play but the sheer gleeful hilarity of this game more than makes up for the frustrationsupbeat musicsnappy mini games and lovable characters all bumbling their way to victory or slime?yes it is and I love itgee forty hoursseriously?  In that time I have managed to win two episodes  Bear in mind I am terrible  Two victories out of hundreds of failures  Sweet sweet victories  This sounds like a pretty bad ratio but really each victory feels truly momentous especially considering the ever increasing number of cheating hackersbut now it is the norm and it is really making me lose interest  This is supposed to be Fall GuysNOT Fly Guys  There is very little competitive edge when you know the dude who is hovering above the level is going to automatically win!  I am now at the grinding stage just trying to collect the rest of the cosmetics for the seasonand unless Mediatonic add some kind of anti cheatthis is going to quickly lose the large casual audience  We shall see what Season 2 bringsbut if the hackers are going to be allowed to continue operating I don't see myself joining the ranks of hopeful suckers never able to get a legitimate winwhich I know has been a bone of contention in some other releases (hello DOOM: Eternal) but it was desperately needed here and to be fairI haven't happened upon any filthy dirty hackers since  So now I can get back to being terrible through my own volitionI'm off back to my glorious upbeat technicolour failureIgnore the negative reviews about server issues There's no way they could have predicted the player base would be this big If anything it's an indicator about how fun the game iseveryone wants a piece of itCool funny chill gamebut actually 20â‚¬ for that game idkkinda little bit overpricedhopefully will there be an faster report system to ban those playersif you dont know what to playA battle royale that's funwhy did no one think about this before?Iâ€™d recommend this game for all agesvery fun to play :D It would be better tho if they added some custom game modes so you can practice maps or you can play with your friends only Overallit's a really fun game if you're looking for something frustrating yet exciting at the same timeI never expected that running Tic Tacs can be so fun and malding at the same timeit needs more maps but still funThis game is fantastic The devs are super involved with their community and the future seems really bright The Takeshi's Castle influence is strongtoofor fans of that show It's practically a hugging simulator tooif you're in to thatHackers destroying this game  most of them only use their hack on final matchI'll change the review when dev provide ways to report hackers ingame

1,"I saved my car from sliding off the expressway IRL because of this gameI have committed war crimes using a 2001 Honda Civic.this game really makes me wanna crash my car in real life and see if the physics match upI love hitting cars. Then coming home to play this and hit more cars 10/10I've had it since it released on Steam day 1 and have accumulated 3700+ hours to date... I think I can safely recommend it.Life is the best BeamNG.drive simulator.some things I like about this game:which are very detailed and have many different areas.controlleror steering wheel.---{Graphics}---I've been driving for well over 20 years nowand I've never gotten myself into an accident.always watching out for other drivers and reacting.and it still never gets old. I've driven myself off cliffssmashed into guardrailsand decided to see what happens when you DO get into an accident.chuckle and nod at the destructionand then do it all over again.which I've played a few times and are loads of fun. Buuuuuutt....if you'll excuse meI need to see what happens when I take a 3 wheeled unstable vehicle over jump.I am currently a traffic crash investigator for a Sheriff's Department in the US. Not only is this ""game"" funit has the potential to be a great tool in the field of traffic crash reconstruction. The physics engine hands down is VERY close to the real thing. Part of my job consists of taking real world crash datareconstructing and mathematically remodeling crash and vehicle dynamics. That saidnot only is this game (simulator really) extremely funit has the potential down the road to aid law enforcement in the reconstruction of fatal crashes. Similar programs that take raw physics data and convert them to 3D renderings such as this one can go for upwards of $50000. Although Beamng.drive is not to the level of forensic softwareit could be with some tweaking and insight.but this isn't the full game and is to be expected.equationsetcand you could possibly license a professional versionwhich could spell big money. Some type of mode to enter real world vehiclesmanipulate vehicle weightsbe able to place them on a road at certain angles and certain speeds etc. would be awesome. I can tell you already that the game in its current state will yield crash results in the same ballparkvery close to the real world.Interested in Sim Racing ? It has you coveredI can keep going. Though I haven't full understood this sandbox myself because there is so much to dobut even thenI highly recommend it because it is one of a kind and it does almost everything with finesse.Biggest tips for new players who may be bored quickly: Explore the menus. BeamNG.drive is more than just crashing cars. By exploring every single menu (and sub menus inside of those menus) on the side-bar you open up A LOT of possibilities. From changing almost every component in your carto making awesome replaysa bit of roleplayingand setting up car chases.maybe from YBRor Mighty Car Vidsand Muye.be it they're not ready for a full releaseor for copyright reasons they cant be included. There are tons of extra mods on BeamNG.drives official website.Drove into a wallThis game is THE best driving simulator i know.you ask?you will break your suspension. oh don't worry you can still finishbut you'll have to suffer the consequences of your decisions... or you can restart the scenario and try again with a fresh car to get a clean run! as the youtuber Jimmy Broadbent said: in beamng compared to so many other racing gamesthe car actually feels like an object you have to look after.tarmac rallytrack racingdriftingderbyoff roaddragor simply just cruising in a comfy road car at comfy speeds. there is a career mode i have tried a little and intend to look into more with nice fun challenges that are not conventional of your typical racing sim. there are a lot of scenarios you can choose fromlike classic dirt rallying (i really love dirt rally and it's really good in this game)police chasescool stunts like in moviesdeliveriesraces (some light and breezy and some very challenging) and sooooo much more. i have played 20 hours so far and haven't even remotely scratched the surface of this game's content.a highly detailed and very huge map of a countryside in italy with very long serpentine roadsthat go through the mountains and seaside with three cities to explore and drive in and countless dirt and gravel roads to put your rallying skills to the test. there is Industrial sitewhere you can practice your driftingrallycross/derby. there is east coast usa where you can cruise on the highway and make cool police chase scenarios.even so that they made most of them accessible on their website and in game. you can download mapscomponents for your carsnew carsand so much more. i recommend getting the nurburgring map mod. you can find it in the repository under the name ks_nord it's a super realistic FREE and SCANNED map of the legendary nurburgring circuit in the nurburg area in germany. most of the fanmade mod maps in this game looked really good to me and it's fun to see such a loving and passionate comunity in a racing game. also look up beammp which is a multiplayer mod for the game. it is being constantly looked after and updated by their creators and so far i find it really fun doing some roleplay with peopleracing and cruising.If my 5000 and counting hours on this game doesnt already say itread this:an acurate one. It requires a good computer to run most of the timebut its so worth it. If you like drivingbreaking thingsor wondering around aimlessly in vast and detailed maps in a carthen this game is for you.I crashed into a school bus---{Graphics}---SUPER fun.  After finding out about thisI went on a search to find any free games that could do what this thing could do.  Nothing.  ThenI took off the free filterand still nothing compared! This game is a true simulation of physicsand it does it extremely well and accurately.  The next best thing would be rigs of rodsbut even that doesn't come anywhere close to the power and freedom you have in BeamNG.  Highly recommended!im a simple mani see car go boom and it makes me happyDriving off cliffs is therapeutic DIFFICULTY "
1,"November 2018 : With Space Industry /Rocketry Upgrade the late game has become longer and relatively harder The amount on content the game has nowand the time one can put into it is well worth the money!yes you should buy the game The pace is now smoother(slower?) and the research tree deeperwhich adds both the ease to learn early on and the difficulty to progress later Beyond the efforts of survivalthe end goals are one's own See how many cycles you last? Wish to have the best things for your suplicants? or do it againbetter this time?telling you the game is uninteresting What puts people offI assumeis the mid-game Starting and setting up base is the fun part but is hardly a challengewhich is why most people enjoy it The mid-gamepresentlyis where the base needs planning and strict management to survive - where everything starts to fall down a spiralprobably which is where people have a falling out The difficulty spikes during this mid periodwhere resourcestasks and dupes need to be managed if you wish to go on further - where it becomes a niche genre - some people love itsome don't After this difficult and rather annoying periodthe game becomes a bit of a sandbox and you can let your creativity flourishwith advanced machineries and systems Bases evolve to their final formmostly sustaining themselves and an easier relaxed life for your dupesand honestlyif my life allowed iti'd play it a lot more The ai is a tad wonky but perhapsgoing out of early access will fix itfor mehas improvedno bamboozle710 hours playing this game currently  To put this in context I am a 40 year old professional  While most games I play keep me entertained for a week or so I always come back to oxywith the amount of time I have spent on it  This is not true though  I have never made it to the surface or to the lava at the bottom  The mid game is incredibly difficult  You go from being well positioned to just managing crisis after crisis   Eventually I just give up and abandon the colony and your dups only to try againbut I have faced the reality of the enevitable so many times  Highly recommend this game  Highly  I think I have spent about 3 cents a minute to entertain myself and I am still addictedand this was a HUGE helpis to climb to the top first  Space is a vacuum and I dumped all my carbon out the trash instead of trying to process it which was taking all of my resources  This really was a game changer for me  Anyway Cyberpunk came out and I took a break for awhile but I will be playing this game againWith over 1000+ hour into the gameI have to take the time to the leave a review for itbut aware of what your are jumping into There is a lotA LOT of things to learn in this game There will be a lots of restart and a new gamebut you will learn and progress more each time Think of it as ''It's more about the paththan the final destination''  While playingcheck for tutorials online If you need helpcheck online The community is great!

CO2 pits; the different ways to manage critters and plants - a wild critter or a wild plant may be much more valuable to you than a tame/farmed one; managing Pufts; managing Dreckos; which bits of tech are useful/criticaland which seem to be little more than red herrings designed to waste your time and resources; the weird way that fluids and gases work; the different ways that pipes/ducts/conveyor elements connect upand the quite non-obvious but critical aspect that the white/green endpoints play in determining how flows are managed; heat and how to destroy it effectively; those dupe positive/negative traitsand which really really matter (and which negative traits are potentially actually positive traits); polluted water is in some ways superior to regular waterand is itself potentially a resource to be managed; how wires or pipes built in adjacent cells can be connected instantaneously without dupe involvementbut disconnecting them is a bit of a pain; Chlorine gas as a disinfectantbut nonsensically only outside of reservoirsnot inside them; digging diagonally is potentially incredibly useful when negotiating tricky environments - and how you can create vacuum conditions through such excavation; how vacuum works - the perfect insulator because they didn't model radiation for some reason; the weird pseudo physics in generalwhere things kind of seem like they're roughly modelled on real physicsbut with major weirdnessbut for a variety of reasons once you get into the rocketry phase I just found it to lose a lot of the vibrancy that marks the earlier parts of the game  You aren't really facing survival challenges by the time you get to that pointit's just about scaling up your systems to deal with massive resource sinksand that just gets a bit tedious  I kind of feel that the systems that are there at the end now don't really fit - there is a 'tier' of resources and technology at the end that you can't really use as part of the survival/optimization game because you've basically run out of motivation at that point  The survival pressure needed to be maintainedand getting access to resources of other planets feels like it should obviously have been an extension of the core game where you have to set up little mining/exploration bases on the other planetoids with even harsher environmental/logistical conditions and deal with having very limited supplies that you can send via the rocketsbut otherwise make do as best you can with the resources on the remote planetit's a fantastic game for the most partand it's way too easy to get caught up in it and have it haunting your thoughts at all times of the day and night  Enjoy!My colonists are starving because my plants aren't growing because my greenhouse is getting too hot because my cooling system isn't running because I'm running low on power because my oil power plant isn't running because I don't have enough oil because my oil well isn't running because it doesn't have enough water because the water pump is submerged in hot steam instead of water because I'm not cooling the steam fast enough because my cooling system isn't running because my aquatuners are overheating because they aren't made out of steel because I cannot make steel because making it heats up my colony too much which would be fine if my cooling system was operationalif you can make a self-sustaining colonyput it on your job resumeI have played this game religiously since it was in alpha and my best friend gifted it to me There were years where I played this game almost exclusively You'll get frustrated at the things you don't know and have to learn about the game when you start and you'll often wonder what it is that your dupes are even thinking when they do stupid things but I cannot recommend a game more than this There is so much to learn and explore in this gameit is crazy I've put over 5k hours into it though and thought it was about time I left a reviewI am an Engineer by trade Never have a played a game that works your problem solving brain to this extent in abstract ways! If you count in the hours I've watched other people play this game when Im unable to play myself (sometimes while I'm at work -_-) then I am probably around the 500 hour mark currently!(most of which you have brought on yourself) but I promise you that once you get into the swing of things there is hardly a more rewarding and entertaining game on the market today This is a game that is well worth full pricebut if you can get it 50% off its just a no brainer The steam Workshop is well supported and there are also plenty of really great tutorials on youtube of tricks to keep in mind (Francis John is the best)Another awesome game by Klei (Creator of Don't StarveMark of the Ninja)this definitely worth a tryso the content is not final and have bug/performance issue in some casesI can assure you that you won't be disappointedfoodtemperatureand stressinstead they are control by AI and you are just giving them a list of orders/job that they have to do/completeit's better if you read the game description and see some screenshots or gameplay videohardcore or tryhard modeor perhaps make it worst?)it's like crack Probably illegal in some countrybe carefulso avoid those loud sleeper (negative trait)except they got awesome stat & you know what you are doingtry to get the lowest decor when you start picking your first 3 dupesDiggingand Construction are pretty useful for early game Another good attribute to consider are Athletics (they move fastercan easily be trained but still useful if they are high from the start) & Strength (currently you can't train thisso definitely has its own value)get those sandstonealgae & copper (metal)you might think you have enough algae But [b]NOyou don't[/b]your dupes need a place to pee and poop or they will make a messso enjoy looking at your dupes running on the hamster wheelCO2 are black CO2 can stack up pretty fastbe careful with it They are heavier than O2so they will fall at the bottom of your colony/base (they also tend to go right)try to open area that have them (you don't need to dig them)dupes are not the smartest creature in the asteroidsometime they can kill themselves in the most unpredictable (stupid) scenariobut be careful not to expand too much or open a big vacuum area when your oxygen production is still low9 highest (avoid using 9 for all your job ordersetting all to 9 means no 9) You should probably check the other tools tooand overlay (top right) They are usefuljust don't kill any creature before you actually know what they do (good or bad)but be very careful with your oxygen & food supplyit is not[/b]but you should start worrying when they are getting out of controlso they'll go upward)be very careful Some example: Algaeclean waterand metal (coppergold) at early game Sands and coal at mid-late gameremember to take care of your dupe When stress hit you hardit will be a snowball effect and your colony is doom before you realize itsome building have bad decor and it is bad for your dupes (use decor overlay)some building emits heat and can be overheated (break & need repaircost time & resource againuse overlay to check)like dupeyour life matter too You need fooddrinkand sleepI never imagined myself to be the kind of gamer who would enjoy building the perfect bathroomupgraded to real toilets/sinks/showersand I became mired in the details of waste water disposal and treatment I built a massive tank to hold the water with a pump to extract it I agonized over the thermal properties of my pipes so I could transfer the liquid for treatment and somehow kill its germs with extreme temperatures while in transit Then I had to figure out what to do with that heat so plants in my greenhouse wouldn't dieor even worseI accidentally melt an ice biome and flood my base) Eventuallyafter much trial and errorI had a sustainable water treatment process that recycled my duplicants own waste Then the Stinky I left on a ledge above and forgot about peed in the water and ruined everythingthe possibilities are truly endless And while the game variables aren't grounded too much in realitythis game provides a great way for amateurs to appreciate real world physics and materials science I don't know much about the history of the development of the gamebut it's amazing this even exists I hope the game continues to evolve and perhaps even gets a sequel It has dominated my steam library ever since I bought itwho needs other games with this much to do?ahh fuckI messed up the placement of a room that could easily be fixed with a bit of effortbut do it RIGHT this timeI messed up the layout of my spacefarer modulebut do it RIGHT this itmeThis game is a poster child for early access gone rightI don't ever write reviews Check my profile -

don't get this gameYou need an engineer degree to play this gameI see people complaining that there is no point to the game other than trying to design a system and I can't really argue against that I just want to give a personal positive review for those folks that enjoy designing systems just for the sake of it- this game is really great for that For me it scratches a bit of the Factorio itch but in its own charming way The devs are also adding new dynamics to the game fairly regularly which is encouraging Price point seems fair as well"
1,"You might be wondering why the countless hours in this game. Wellwonder no more! It was all due to the garbage grinding that took place.but it is infested with PayToWin Squads. Credit card swipes all the way. What use is there when every timeyou are going against Lamborghinis or Bugatti Veyronswith your basic 4 wheeler. My basic 4 wheeler has players that I grinded heavily for by raking up those weekly rank rewards. Decent TOTWsObjectivesand standard cards. Total squad value = 85 millionbut this is nothing compared to the other squads out there. All that with 3 months of grinding. Utter garbage!the game concept is --> PayToWin or GrindTillDeath(with no deserving benefits whatsoever). Playable only the first 3 months upon release if you use the ""GrindTillDeath"" concept. That is because most of the squads are ONLY half done with the non-stop credit card swipes. Beyond the 3 monthsglhf! as the PayToWin Squads would have fully infested the game. Every match that you playwould be them. Somebody call the Pest Exterminator!can you guys do something and be a proper competitor rather than being a baby at the sidelines? You guys remind me of Hazards glorious impact at Real Madrid.it is a special day for someone every time he opens a pack. (Looking at you MattHDGamer) Red-listed clown luring the PayToWin Heroes in! ""The grind is real guys"" - MattHDGamer. Dudedo you even know what is the true meaning of Grind? Apparentlyselling off your houseputting that money on packsand pressing that button to open the pack is grind. My goodness! My brain. Welp!EA.have been back playing FUT casually. No more of that seriousness which I had during the first 3 months of playing though. Howeverone can actually get better in the game by practicing and etcmay reach Division 3 or 2but every game would be a struggle with the PayToWin experts despite the practice.but a costlierexpensive team can always perform better/smoother skill movesshootingetc compared to the cheaper team. Soit is pointless to even try/practice to get better as it will come down to that.only experienced the following after playing 1000++ division rivals matches:-to mimic real world scenario of last minute goals)etcmy highest achievements are as follows:thus the review :)This will be my last EA purchase. I use hibernate mode on my laptop and typically do not exit the game when I put my laptop into hibernation. Howeveron one occasionwhen I was playing SBa glitch happened and the AI computer took over my gameplay. Not wanting to forfeit the matchI allowed the game to play out and got a victory. Shortly afterI receive an email from EAdescribing how I am a cheater and got a 7 days suspension. Alsothey deleted my FUT team just before un-suspending my account.I lost all my pre-order bonuses. I had a long online text chat with EA and they could not do anything to help me.I went to play Division Rivals. That was when I met the REAL hackers. I was hit with the disconnect hack which is pretty common.

This is basically fraud. I am shocked to see that I could have just played FIFA19.designed and focused upon a fake FUT feature thats just there to make kids gamblebuy card packs and more.so its REGRESSED. Seriouslyhow can people accept this as a NORM.a 57 rated striker plays before me for about 9 of the 12 games and hasnt scored a single goal!!!with the highest rating in the team (68).

1,"So should you get Baldur's Gate 3? If you really like Larian RPG games then probably yeahit's a lot like their other games with a few major differences that might make you not enjoy the game:they're based on 5E D&D so they're based on your classso your class selection is very important and you'll need a balanced partylike Ray of Frost leaving ice beneath the feet of enemies and similar spells leaving fields on the ground that debuff or damage targets Ray of Frost is the biggest offender since slipping on ice ends your turnor your opponents turn making it the best mage cantrip for its RNG valueso far it seems like it has nothing to do with the other Baldur's Gates game besides the fact you're trying to get to Baldur's Gate to some degree but can't because monsters are fucking around in the countrysideas per usual Your character is also not a Bhaalspawn so I'm not sure why they called it Baldur's Gate 3 when more accurately it should be like: Baldur's Gate: The Mind Flayering or something similarmine is fairly powerful and with the game ready Nvidia Driver the game runs smoothhowever textures kinda pop in weirdlythe game is in Early Access so it's expected that the graphics aren't full up to snuff yetit feels pretty good they got the 5E stuff in game to work really well and they added in special weapon attacks that make a big difference The Combat is deadlybut fair and you have loads of options to subvert encounters and crush your enemies Beyond that it's not a big murder hobo affair either you do murder many things but I was surprised when I actually found some friendly monsters who'd normally be murder hobo fodder Larian also wisely shot the alignment system of D&D in the head behind a shed which was a good move since 5E doesn't really use that system very much anyways I find the AI however has a hard time handling stealth attackswhere I can sometimes get three free stealth attacks against monsters if I have my rogue hidden wellperhaps that's a bug or a reward for good positioning I can't sayno spoilers)or at the very least treat you as a decent person I read some reviews after playing where reviewers complained that the party ALWAYS hated you But I only ever felt that one NPC hated meand now after a few hours into the game they talk to me as an ally and have even confided into me about some of their own secrets making me feel like it's something that could easily become a true friendship One praise I'll give it that others will call negative is that some persuasion options might not be good ideas Please use your common senseyou might not want to tell sensitive things about your situation to certain people or even if you pass your check it might have a negative outcomein this case passing the check makes a really bad situation a bit less bad You also get special dialogue options due to some special magical powers you get rather early on in the game though I'll avoid calling them by name because that could be a spoiler which give you OP persuasion options that you cannot failhowever I like that the game implies that by using these powers you can get some negative backlashthese options even let you learn extra details about certain characters that share your condition though I have opted not to use them since I assume it will worsen my relationship with the character The only downside of conversations is that in single player you can't change who is talking to perform skill checks I had a Dex check in a conversation to pick a lock but couldn't let the rogue do his job to pick the lock There was also lacking a dialogue option of me just using the key I had on me to unlock the shackles the guy was trapped in The animations in conversation are also fairly stiff looking and your character only has a few stances they takethey're kinda annoying and I hope they add more variety to themyou get a large area to explore and the characters are varied and the story interesting if a bit high fantasythough I feel Baldur's Gate was also High FantasyI will say I'm not a fan of certain named characters existing in the world like Volo who I foundbut I was happy to learn you can also mindlessly murder such refferences and rob their dead caracasses with only minimal consequences (I bribed a guard like 200 gold after I killed Volo and stole all of his swagit was super worth I'd recommend murdering Volo in every game he's in)  Beyond that I'd say the game is on the right track to be a cool RPGthough the game requires patience if you want to avoid murder hoboingthe game gives most characters even goblins actual names which makes talking to them and learning their secrets worthwhileI'd recommend talking to as many people as your patience can handle to solve problems non-violently since some fights are nearly unwinnable Also don't forget to scout around with your rogue to find shenanigans to cheese encounters and make sure you're not about to walk into a hornets nestI can finally play D&D alone because I don't have friendsI am an RPG enthusiast and I can say this game is just the bestright up my alleyI played the original Baldur's Gate games when I was a kid with my dadhe loved all the old school PC gamesand I'm really glad I get to play another oneand so far this game hasn't disappointed meI know he'd love itOnly 8 hours in and I'm loving itbeware thoughif you're expecting a remastered BG1/2 you will be sorely disappointed This is Larian's version of Baldur's Gate and it is therefore very similar to DivinityIm giving this a positive reviewbecause it's one of the best games i've ever playedbut do yourself a favor and be patientGonna be really cool in like 3 years[b] Well this game has alot of faces [/b] On one side it's a Larian game and many people wanna compare it to [i] Divinity Original Sin 2 [/i] in hopes it will become some kind of ""spiritual succesor"" to it On a different face this has [i] Baldurs Gate 3 [/i] in the titleso people look back to the old BG games and try to compare it to thatBut the truth is[b] BG3 is none of those [/b]you'll recognize alot of things from it in here This is why some people are inclined to dislike BG3 at firstNarratively and MechanicallyNarratively and Mechanicallyand from what i hear Larian plans to have all or at least as close to all of them as possible at launch Which is awesome From the Player perspectiveit's so refreshing to just be able to boot up a game and play a D&D 5e campaign without having to schedule meetings with others and run a 7 hour session Don't get me wrong I still do thatbut it's so cool to have that experience without all the effort that you have to go through in real life lolBG3 is also [b] great[/b] The RPG elements are so well definedCombat is fluid and takes pace just as if you were using Roll20 or Pen and Paper (well it's quite faster since you don't have multiple people thinking over what to do) Animations and Graphics are wonderful to look at And the narrative it's delivered in such a cinematic way Also something to noteCombat can be very difficultbecause most of the enemies you see even if they are taken from the D&D lore are alot more powerful than in D&Dlikeyou see goblins casting Bless and using Action Surge n stuffwhich made me laugh Goblins are scary hereBG3 can give you 30 to 40 hours of gameplay PER CHARACTER you makethat's if you'd like to try more than one classand you probably will And though content will be the samethere are multiple ways of dealing with the same situations you facewich is something not many games offerbut nothing gamebreaking And the game still has plenty of room to improvewe'll see where Larian takes this game tobut it's looking good so farand if you can spare the cash and can't waitget it nowyou won't regret it either way [/b]Can throw children At other childrenYou know those reviews saying ""oh it's just Divinity Original Sin 2 with the D&D rules""? Wellthey are antiquated Larian put out the game in a very earlyexperimental stageand since they built the engine starting from the DOS2 onethere were of course going to be a lot of similarities that didn't mesh And lo and beholdLarian did and still does listen to their fanbase People were rightly saying that jumping was obnoxiousit got fixed People were rightly having problems with dicerollsthey got fixed People were rightly saying that backstab shouldn't give advantageand it got fixed I have never seen this level of prompt response and engagement with the communityit sounds fantastic both in music  and voice actingand the whole experience is just fantastically immersivenot to mention the characters! OhI have a crush for about half the NPCs aroundYes some parts need expanding or reworkingand yes it hurts that we can't yet go beyond Act Onebut holy guacamole is this a good start and a better continuation Hearty recommendationFull disclosureI worked on the original Baldur's Gate series (BG: TotSC through BG: ToB and Neverwinter Nights) as a designer/scriptor  I was hands on with scripting questsenemy encounterssetting up 'cinematics'creating itemsspellsmonstersplacing them and so on Iâ€™m not sure how best to review BG3 in Early Accessand Iâ€™m trying to keep in mind the full release is at least a year away I also feel like I've been in enough EA/Betas to realize some things won't change much from how they are now I mention working on the originals so youâ€™re aware I have some bias with the series (Believe meitâ€™s not worth mentioning to put up with trolls and insults otherwise)I have certain expectations OtherwiseBG: <Insert Subtitle Name> would have been preferred But the choice to include â€œ3â€ means something to meso I'll treat it as suchbut it doesn't feel like 'Baldur's Gate' to me Pathfinder: Kingmaker and Pillars of Eternity feel more similar to what I'd expectincluding trying to include a great storymemorable charactersquestsmany choices in how you portray your character and approach thingsand a mix of real-time w/ pause D&D combat The lack of a real-time combat component has thrown me off from feeling like this is supposed to be a sequel It was a defining part of BG at the timewhether or not you like the featureclasses and races There are a lot of choices availablewith a lot more to come which is great I hope thereâ€™s eventually more variety in faces/hair personallyAbilitiesSkillsSpellsMonsters and so on  Againit's not a BAD thingand it's enjoyablebut it feels like I'm playing a new Divinity Game set in Forgotten RealmsIâ€™m just saying what it is and how the gameplay feels I personally enjoy both stylesbut it's not what I'd expect from a game labeled as a Baldurâ€™s Gate sequel The fact is it feels like Divinity more than other CRPGs and thatâ€™s thatmost likely one of which you will NEVER use Party size is limited to 4and you probably won't want to double up with your own protagonist's choice in class Initial impressions are there are a lot of angrybossy people in this worldnot arguing if itâ€™s a good or bad thingbut itâ€™s noticeable at the moment how theyâ€™re portrayed It constantly feels like my party is disappointed in my actions if I try to help peopleand Iâ€™ve only played a few hours into the game I have no other choices of who to bring alongso yes itâ€™s a little frustratingsome morally questionablesome valorous choices and so on near the beginning  So far it feels as though everyone is out for themselvesand it's a bit hard to like them as a resultThey are more memorable for something afflicting them (vampirismtime bombangeretc) than a personality This might change over time of coursebut thatâ€™s my initial impressionlearning about them and their personalities and having a lot of options for party make ups Choice and variety were always important Telling me theyâ€™re â€œsupposedâ€ to dark doesnâ€™t help or change the fact it feels like there should be more options in classes and personalitieswhich Iâ€™m not sure will changea companion died before Iâ€™d even met themthanks to enemies ganging up on him It was interesting and Iâ€™m glad that conversations changed due to their (and others) death If not for another play through thoughIâ€™d have completely missed out on a companion due to RNG without even knowing itand I had no way to help them in time Iâ€™d have no choice for my party at all if I didnâ€™t want to double up on classesarcana checks can help you decipher languages you may not knowand rolls for intimidationpersuasion and so on are included in dialogue options Iâ€™m happy for this featureas it makes me feel like those skills seem to matter herenot so muchand while I'm sure they want to maintain some mysteryI guess I don't understand the choice yet Larian has already made some amazing popular gamesand if they wanted to go down their own Forgotten Realms story Iâ€™d look forward to it Whether it's in storygameplaycharactersinteractionschoices thoughit doesn't feel like thereâ€™s any continuation from the original games currently It might be there at some pointI don't knowbut at this time I haven't seen ittaking the game in their own direction Thatâ€™s completely finebut letâ€™s face itsome people were hoping to find more of a continuation of BG1&2 with a similar playstyleand not so much a D&D version of Divinity Whether or not you like one style of gameplay over the other isnâ€™t the point really Reviews should give information and opinions for those still deciding if they should spend money on this gameand not something similar to Divinitywould be disappointed? At this timeYes Saying the game play is better for you doesnâ€™t change the fact that it is what it is Some will love it and some will be disappointedwhile others donâ€™t mind either way You should all make up your own mind at the end of the day and enjoy the games you likebut if Iâ€™m honestI was hoping for more of a change from how it feels from Divinity I can look past itbut I know others wonâ€™tor donâ€™t want to Even with D&D rulesstatsspells and naming conventionsI barely notice a difference truthfullywhile annoyingstill feel uniquenot generic and thereâ€™s enough there that I do want to learn more about them Spells and monsters look and act as expected from D&D 5E There are some bugsand the game does need polish but itâ€™s still very playable and enjoyable in Early Access If you want a full feature game thoughwith all the questsclasses and balanceI'd highly recommend you try to waitit is more alike to Divinity in spirit than to Baldurâ€™s Gate though in my opinion So I struggle to feel as though itâ€™s a sequel to Baldurâ€™s Gate so far other than in name and knowing the city itself will make an appearance down the road That may change one daybut not today300 hours in and I'm still finding new quests that I've missed - New personal cutscenes with my player character and my companions - New dialogue and character development that I revealed by strengthening my relationships with my companions and gaining their trust I wasn't going to write a reviewI was going to just continue to enjoy my time in early access alone and with friendsbut playing as much as I haveI feel compelled to share my experience In all honestyI am beyond impressed Let's set 'early access' aside for a moment because it has the customary visual bugs etc that one would expect However; the story being told here in the world and especially between you and your companions is beyond top notch The dialogue in this game has made me laugh my ass off at timesand has also made me cry real heartfelt tears Anyone who enjoys story driven games and has the time to really dig in and get to know the characters in this game will be rewarded My advice is to take your time with it Save often Go back to camp and sleep often Make new races and charactersand make different choices to see how different one playthrough can be from another Take the time to gain trust between your companions and they will respond in kind If the first act is any indication of what the final product will besaying that I am looking forward to the full release is a large understatement Well doneLarian Well fucking done mates This is what an rpg should beReally loving this game even in early accesslevel 4 capand only Act 1 availablewith games like DOS:2 showing how much they listenfrom first release to Patch 6 (most recent at time of writing this) - Larian have showed they will listen to the players and improve the game and the mechanics in so many waysthen you're likely going to be a bit disappointedand as the game continues I can't wait to see what more they add (LARIAN IF YOU ARE READING THIS PLEASE ADD THE SHIELD SPELL)with the BardBarbarianPaladin and Monk (yes I intentionally avoided artificer just for all you Eberon nerds out there) And I am hoping we see some more sub-class options for the existing ones (TEMPEST CLERIC - OMG PLEASE!)as of Patch 6is still a very fulfilling experience and even in its current form has a great deal of replay value Because each character you create will have different strengths and weaknessesdifferent ability point distributiondifferent skill proficiencyand the fact that different classes can get different and class-specific dialogue options makes replaying this game actually something that I find myself wanting to doand not dreading (I love you Fort Joy - but I wont miss re-running you)and can go in wildly different directions depending on what you choose to say    and how well you roll on your charisma check ;)turn-based combat of D&D 5th edand have meaningful feedback that actually gets taken on board and implemented by the Dev's (several suggestions I made almost a year ago have been added to the game!) - then doooooo it!This is my review of the Early Access of Baldur's Gate III It's gonna be a lenghty one so bare with me if you would I will be talking about individual parts of the game with my thoughts and if need be also add a Pro/Con for this version thus far Those of you who don't wanna read more you can just refer to that part of the review and conclusionbut since it's Early Access with limited content there is always room for improvement as seen with other titles that Larian have worked onbefore finally getting to the gameplay side of it Itoowas apprehensive that this game was going to be Divinity Original Sin 3 and only Baldur's Gate in name There is some truth in this truly (from some mechanics that are pulled from the DOS games to being able to pick up everything to being very colorful and comedic unlike the setting of Baldur's Gate which is supposed to be very groundeddark and grittyand started interacting with the worldthe charactersraces it felt like going back home to this wonderful world of Faerun So much lore strewn about in booksreferences to past events & familliar places made my thoughts about how it feels more like Divinity in a visual sense go away I am more narrative inclined than gameplay when it comes to preference in CRPG's  and I love reading lore so I explored every nook and cranny of the content that was available and tried my best to see every outcome possible by save scumming (a staple as a CRPG veteran I would reckon to say) I will not go into a Story gameplay section because this game is worth experiencing for yourself and if you have seen the trailers already that should be enough to tell you if you are interested in the story or notbecause I grew up on these games and it makes the combat way faster I understand the reason why they decided to go with turn basedbecause it's a strength of theirs and you always try to build to your strengths But""D&D tablet top is turn based so it makes sense for this to be that way"" I understand both sidesbut let me tell you why I wanted to avoid mostly every encounter in DOS 2because once you are engaged in combat with more than 10 enemies it will take over 1-2 minutes before you get to use your character again And unless you can attack multiple times based off your action points like you can in Divinity or Wasteland then you will be ""wasting"" at least 15-30minutes depending on how long the fight is every single combat encounter If you have bad luck and you want to redo that fight or something else unfortunate happens that you don't want to you have to redo the whole fight Luckily they added a save system during combat which can be usedBUT it's easily exploitableof coursean encumberance system I will never understand why this is still a thingit doesn't make the game fun when you CAN pick up so many things and yet you have to either send the extra items to Camp Stash or pass it a long to another companion Another thing with inventory is that the inventory is separated between characters so every time you want to give someone something you have to open 2 menus to do sobecause of these skill checks You specializing in a certain area and RNGdecides to give you three 1 rolls in a row on a 5 check (mind you I have +2 proficiency in charismapersuasion and guidance on) makes no sense to me I hope they tune this in the future to have a certain threshold I understand they want to do it like D&D where there isn't a reload option in tabletopbut this isn't FUN at all I always choose social stats over combat ones in most situations because I'd rather get more information than having to fight it out Even after building myself that way I STILL needed to reload countless times to get passed those persuasion checks I am proficient intoDAOME fans will love this)featsraces etc)animation bugsdialogue loopsquest bugsperformance issues (everything goes in here due to being an unfinished game that is still being worked on and will be fixed with time)but keeping in mind that a lot of things have to be changed for balance sake and NO if you can't handle pretty much what I wrote in the CONS sectionThis is a turned based DnD game with RNG battles    I am 56 and new to turn based games as well as DnDyou can move freely - but once you engage in battle you move into static turn based mode   Battle mode can happen when you least expect it  Save often for this reason  If you are playing solo -- you have a lot of inventory and spells to manage  If you are looking for a rush thru fantasy RPG -- this aint itdesigned the battle graphics and wrote the enchanting luring music  -- make sure you keep them on the payroll  for sure!!

1,"PUT IT IN THE FREE TO PLAY SECTION NO-ONE KNOWS THIS GAME EXISTS(snorts line of coke) ""So you know halo right""portal but with gunsA movement FPS that transcends movement?but the higher you go on the skill curve the more of your actual movement gets replaced with dipping in and out of portals So while it's possible to sprint and fly around pretty fastyou quickly learn any movement outside of portaling is suboptimal this means the ""movement"" in the game turns into peeking angles rapidly by shooting portals: in other words as the skill gets higher you and your targets move less and less and the angles themselves move via portal placement even the actual gunplay and dodging becomes very much secondary to angle and route selection or blocking so that's pretty weird for a ""movement shooter"" where so much of the fun traditionally comes from tracking and juking targets as they movebouncing ricochetingand various newtonian physics (although there are a few gimmicky launches you can do by falling through portals at terminal velocity which is fun if not usually practical) but this also doesn't make the game bad by any means theres still a high mechanical and tactical skillcap in portaling even if its minimal on the WASD-side If anything this broadens the appeal to tactical shooter fans since there's an exponential amount of angles and positions to study and masterand also console/controller players since expert 'movement' via portals doesn't require much complex inputs to achieve the way say strafe jumping or tap strafing does (aim assist is very generous as well)and how much the quality/balance of the game depends on the quality of the map If the portal surfaces arent balanced well on a map it seems like it can really mess things up with a classical movement tech like bunnyhoppingyou can still move fast around a new map without being familiar with it but when it comes to portaling around quicklyyou really need to spend time studying angles and routes on a new map or else you'll be very sloweven if you are already adept at swapping portalsbecause the flow and type of practice required is so drastically different as you move up the curveand might be a lot less or a lot more fun than playing naively depending on your tasteafter I got this I gained 2 inchesthanks guysâ¢¸â ‰â ‰â ‰â ‰â ‰â ‰â ‰â¢¸â € â €â¢¸â ‰â ‰â ‰â ‰â ‰â ‰â ‰â¡·â €son?splitgate is one of those games that you playIt made me productiveNow it has Linux support I've been testing it out and it's a huge amount of fun Some of the freshest arena-style FPS I've seen in some time Worth playingit's really smooth on high detailsPortal + Halo = Splitgateits halo with portals that's all you need to know---{Graphics}---Halo + Portal = Funthere's a mode where you score by teabagging on dead bodies 10/10PROS:not much impactimowhich I like[h1] Core Gameplay [/h1]in factthat I want to write a section of this review dedicated entirely to the game [b] without [/b] it's primary gimmickthe portals Fans of Halo Reach would be immediately familiar with the game Tight controlssmooth sprintand powerful feeling guns The jetpack is fun to use and very reminiscent of Tribes: Ascend or Titanfall Combined with portalsit becomes ever more great feeling Splitgate is a good arena shooter andif not for the portalswould be a fantastic f2p halo clonemaps are designed with portal strategies and tactics in mind I won't go into specificsbut strategies can range anywhere from camping a safe side of the map and sniping enemies from a vantage point through your portal - to falling through a portal on the ground and using the momentum to catapult yourself right into the enemy team and shotgun blast their faces offas you can't see through enemy portals - only your own This singular gimmick enables this game to be played by a multitude of differently-minded playersbut there is a ranked mode The gameplay has so many layers built into it that pro-play Splitgate is probably an incredible experience to watch - and probably an equally incredible game to cast forand possibly more to be added TDM is a classicbut VIP and oddball are super fun and exciting to play Snipers and Shotties is a mode loved by many You either snipeor close the distance and shotty I encourage everyone to play every mode at least onceyou may ask?

1,"Greetings from Bulgaria! I am Vulkk (or Alex) and I have been playing SWTOR since one of its beta stages without breaks and time outs I would like to encourage you to give the game a try with this quick review belowwhile still being honest about the flaws of the game in its ""elderly age""and continue through the first digital expansions of the game up to level 60you could only subscribe for a month to get all of the story content unlocked forever for your account Howeveronce you approach the EndGameyou start feeling the limitations of the F2P model very hard Once you find out what it is like to play as a Subscriberyou may struggle to get back to Preferred status player (the middle limitation level) after your Sub expiresbut it shines in the group playespecially if you team up with guildies and have a voice chat available Be it casual or hardcoreraidingPvPingexplorationConquest - everything is more fun with friends in this game Play the class stories alone to immerse yourself fully into themthen join a guild or play with friends once you find yourself in the EndGame grindSWTOR struggles to offer continuously fresh and engaging content to some of the hard-core fans and veterans of the game I myself have been playing it since beta and have witnessed every single  updatechangebright moments and failures over the years It's a thing to considerbut if you are reading this reviewyou are probably wondering if it's worth picking up the game YesabsolutelyThis is a great game for all Star Wars fansI've been playing this game for years and I'm very happy to see it come to Steam! I don't know exactly how many hours I actually havebut I'm sure it's well over 3-4000 Sometimes that is a mark of shameand sometimes that is a mark of pridethis is one of the greatest MMOs ever madebut that does not mean it isn't without flaws The content releases are few and far between (but there is so much already here that's not necessarily an issue)sometimes EA has been known to flex their cash shop muscle in annoying waysand I won't liethis community is one of the more toxic ones I've been apart of There are some very good people who play and will give you the worldbut there are also a ton who will put you down for breathing the wrong way Turn chat off when you're not enjoying group content and you'll probably be much happieryou will love this game and all of its branching paths Even after finishing the 8 class storiesthere are ways to play those stories differently on a second run It's entirely possible to lose yourself while creating alternate charactersand imothat's a great thingthat is an important feature Bioware did not forget their hopeless romantics and perverts Just sayinga few bits of advice:[/b]you get all current content permanently and that is a LOT of content After you do soif it's only the access to content you're afteryou no longer need to keep subscribingmeaning you can access it on multiple characters You can do this by buying the Dromund Kaas or Coruscant stronghold (it's very cheap) and placing the one you get in the mail anywhere inside of your room (Noteyou may need to level your legacy a little bit) When you're about to go over 1 million creditsstore it therepress Y They don't tell you to do this Make a legacygive yourself a last name for all your characters Do it ASAPbecause you'll want to level that baby It's importantdon't waste your time in the cash shop Everything in the cash shop you can get in the game without spending real money by simply farming credits There are manymanymany ways to farm quicklybut there is a guide by swtorista which explains it best Go find her and watch a bunch of her videosshe's greatfinebut if you're not enjoying the storylines there is very little point to playing Don't skip the cutscenes the first time around Give this one a fighting chanceeven on free to play you can skip most of the side quests (there are a ton of them) Stick to the story and do all the heroics on every planet You'll get the gear you need and likely be appropriate levelyou can use that buff on other classes This is why some people can share all 4 buffs at once If you're enjoying the gameleveling each class type (only 4--BH = TrooperSW = JKAgent = SmugglerInq = Consular) might be a decent goal to keep in mindcheck out swtorista's guidesshe's an old gem and has a whole series dedicated to the Steam players coming in This game isn't terribly complicated to get into or even play (especially for people who are familiar to MMOs)but they might help should you need itHaving played this game for nearly 1000 hours nowhere's what I can sayyou still get access to 8 class storieswho take anywhere from 15 to 100 hours each depending on how fast you go through them and if you do side missions Then there's the usual MMORPG content4 man dungeons (called flashpoints)16 man raids (operations) and world bosses all with different difficulty levelsbut in an MMO Some class stories stand outlike the Bond-esque Agent storyor the classic overpowered sith story of the warrior Whoever you areyou'll find a story that suits your stylecoming from WoW and having also played Tera a lotdespite it's agewith your own lightsaber and very cool armor set that you can customizeeven if it got simplified over the years from what I read Your class story will give you access to 5 companions and you can gather more By the time you reach where the SWtoR story is at nowyou'll have a few dozens Companions can all be geared up with the oufits of your choice and story companions all interact with you and have different personalities and preferencesstill giving you access to more content and featuresso that's definitely worth it If you never subhoweveryour adventure will end shortly after the class stories (which can easily give you up to 500 hours of fun if you do all 8!)you will not be able to hit max level and will be capped at 1 million credits (which isn't that much once you start getting really into the game) <-- edit : Upon reflectionI moved the subscription system from ""meh"" to ""good""pvp is quite engaging Everyone gets a built in pvp trinket in their kitand interrupt and a stun It's not incredibly balancedbut most classes should have one spec that works There is however a bad side to pvp in this gamepeople are toxic as fuck in ranked (the most toxic community I've encountered so far)and I'm warning you as someone who reached the highest level of PvP in quite a few mmo's and played online games with a ""PvP mindset"" for the past 25 years (first by griefing people in diablo 1 as a 10 year old kid and getting Gladiator a few times in WoW during college Yeah I'm a boomer)you'll want to get your item level to 306and anything you do in the world will drop gear near your current average item level This means that you could solo your way to a fully optimized set of gear Of courseif you party up and run group content this process will go faster Once you hit 306 (max item level currently) you can hoard those items and twink your fresh lvl 75 altsputting them in best in slot gear instantly This is either good or bad depending on the type of player you are If you're hoping to be one in a million in BiS gear because it's locked behind hard raidsyou'll be dissapointedbut dated I don't mind itas long as the game is responsive when I use abilitiesbut for some people it can be boring This game is no Tera / BDO as far as combat goesthat's for surethe coolest armors (and boy are they dope) are all real money cosmetics Unless you want to shell out the credits and buy them from people who used real money in the first place Admittedlythe cash shop is probably what's keeping the lights on this gamewhile gearing is so easy it's impossible to call it pay to winit's definitely pay to get rich By spending 10$ you can buy a store item that you can then resell for somewhere around 150 million creditswhich is quite a lotbut won't get you one of the best looking lightsabers that go for 500-600 million credits (or 50$ on the store!) Againpurely cosmetic You could be using an ugly wooden lightsaber and it would do the exact same damage with proper modsI'm  happy I picked this game up The last time I spent so much time on an mmo was in the better days of WoW SWtoR has it's flawsbut it's definitely an epic game with an insane amount of high quality content You should at the very least pick it up and run the class stories for free I haven't even gotten through all of them yet either!I have over 3000 hours in the other version I love this game and have completed almost all of the content available You can definitely get the same amount of time or more out of this game If you need help getting startedI am willing to help Just leave your name and server in the commentsthen it is of benefit to sub for a single month But without subscription as long as you complete the main class quest and the planetary quest line you will easily be on track for leveling Also make sure to use your legacy bank for any money that you acquire while unsubbed as that is the only way you can transfer money to other characters on your account The legacy bank is uncapped also Subbing will also let you use artifact gear which is super important to the progression in the endgame I would suggest subscribing then picking that up with the cartel coins you are granted so you can enjoy the endgame betterI have played this game off and on since releaseI would guess 700 total hours or more  This game has had numerous updates over the yearsbut I will tailor this review to newer playersthis game in very welcome to newer playersbut I would suggest ignoring the general chat on starter worldsthis game is fair to play  Whether you sub or notmost of the pay options are cosmetic only  If you subscribe for a single monthonce you revert to free to playyou will be a preferred and keep a lot of the benefitsBeing a subscriber is my preferred way to play  You can level using only the class story and never have to grind sidequests to stay within level requirementsmost of the time you will end up being downleveled to the content as you will be over the max level for the region  The class stories are all fantasticand if you don't have to grind to keep upyou will feel like you have 8 full KOTOR quality gamesto include raids (Operations) and dungeons (Flashpoints) with an easy to use groupfinder and difficulty that allows all ranges of capable and experiences of playersmultiple ways to get involved in PVP to include matches of HuttballSpaceship combatworld PVP and ranked matches  The ranked stuff can get cutthroat and is best experienced with a group of players you knowused mostly for cosmetic purchases)  2  Sub for at least a month  3  Get into a guild (most have already unlocked the 10% experience boost)  I highly recommend my own guild of courseImperial Army on Starforge Serverbest group of players I have ever played with accross all my many years of many games wwwimperialarmyorg   and 4  Experience all the classes to at least level 20 before choosing your main (eventually you are going to want to experience all the class storiesand being subscriber will allow you to do that without breaking up the continuity of lore too much)I have over 10000 hours playing this prior to it being released on Steam I've played it on and off for the past 10 years It's unfortunate that it's only just now being released on Steam after all this time as I don't know how much more I will continue to play it I loved itbut at some point I don't know if I could put in another 10000 hours (It still gets updates and new content)for anyone new to the gamethere is a massive ton of content to exploreand don't be turned off by it being an MMO For players who prefer a single player experience there is still 100's of hours of quality content that can be done alonefriends optionalor a mix of friends and companions PVP is optional and completely avoidablesound effects and music are movie quality and fit easily into the Star Wars universe This is quite possibly the game with both the most quality and quantity of voice acting ever created A huge portion of the games $200+ million dollar budget was spent on voice acting and music production and it showsbut it's still really good looking with the options turned upand it's fairly low on system requirements so even people with older systems can get it runninglight/dark and so on variablesfully decorated at the cost of billions in game and years of effort with dozens of friends to unlock)the game is Free to Play so you can go ahead and at least try it for yourself There is an optional monthly subscription and it will greatly enhance your fun and is needed to unlock some end game (post class story) contentbut you do not need it to start with and can easily see for yourself if you are willing to invest more into the gamebut this is purely cosmetics There is no pay-to-win and it can be completely avoided Most cosmetics from the Hutt Cartel can also be purchased from other players through the market for in-game creditsgive it a trywould you consider following my curator page?[/url]I'm 55 years old this year This one is good for Star Wars fans of all agesOne of the best single player story MMOs out there FYIthis is a review from a mostly solo player viewpoint I've been playing this game very on and off since day 1so I've seen how it's changed and progressed over the years Unlike other MMOsthis one has only gotten better with age There is literally hundreds of hours of single player story contentwith solo dungeons and raids for you to do in case you're like me and enjoy playing solo If you're like me and stopped playing WoW bc of various reasonsI can recommend this game very muchbut there is an emphasis on player control By that I meanyou can have a handful of companions that join you and be your tankdpsor heals You also can heal yourself at any timewhich makes solo content fun I'm still shocked at how all the non force classes play so well and fit into this SW story so well I personally like the Smuggler and Bounty Hunter classes the most You get your own shipbaseand crew that you can deck out how you like4 Empire)and all have their own 20 to 30 hour storydepending on how much side content you do Choices matter and can affect the game in smaller ways The game makes you feel like you're the champion of each class You start small then get bigger and bigger in the story  If you're wanting KOTOR 3then this is what you need to play The story is a sequel to KOTOR 2 (loosely)so you'll see certain characters reappearing or being mentionedbut you're very limited with what you can do if you don't pay Others have said thisbut it's best to sub for just 1 month and then you get put on a preferred status even if you aren't paying anymoreso you still have access to certain features that F2P (never subbed) can't use The Cartel Market is their cash shopbut there's no P2W features It's almost all cosmeticsmountsboosters But all of these can be still purchased in the in game trade market for high prices But it's up to you The game is also new player friendlywith giving you a lot of early tutorials and goodies to show off what you can do right now and at higher levelsI think in 2021 SWTOR is up there with FF14 in terms of single player content I don't do any PVP or hardcore raidingso I can't comment on that part If you're jonesing for KOTOR 3realistically you're never going to get itbut this game is about as close to it as we'll ever see Just do like me and play it solo and just pretend the other players aren't there :)It's a MMO that people play for the storyYou can enjoy this game without paying a cent because you level extremely fast now Understand that if you start Free-to-Playyou aren't going to accumulate wealthuse purple items (artifact)and you will be walking for a while You will be given EVERYTHING you needtherefore you do not need purple items or millions of credits When you finish one or two characters and want to continuepay for one month to get preferred status The ""Chapter"" content that unlocks with a Subscription is vast and worth the one month of subscriptionbut play one class before you decide I played this in 2012 and left it shortly after finishing one class I was shocked that some of the bugs still exist 10 years later but the game itself is greatStar Wars the Old Republic is a game that has been around for eight years nowbut it was never able to shake that bad reputation from its early days Even as of nowpeople are asking if the game is deadthe game is most definitely worth playing in 2020experiencing the story firstthe fault was not completely with the SWTOR Developers Lucasarts closed Star Wars: Galaxies five days before the gameâ€™s launchso Galaxies fans who wanted to continue as they had were vastly disappointed And for several yearsthere were still people playing SWTOR who complained that the game just wasnâ€™t Galaxiesin 2020thereâ€™s a LOT of end game There are currently 30 Flashpointswhich are four-person quests for players to run through together There are also currently 12 Operationswhich are 8-16 player quests with lots of difficult bosses And both Flashpoints and Operations have multiple difficulty settingsthere are five maps for team-based PVPand doing well in these allows players to go into Ranked PVP Doing well in Ranked PVP allows players to get onto the SWTORCOM leaderboardwhich gets updated every two hours And if you keep the top spots until the end of the seasonyou get in-game rewardsyou take on the role of eight class stories across two factionswith four stories per faction And these are widely considered the best stories in the gameplayers head into the faction stories that are Rise of the Hutt Cartel and Shadow of Revan before heading into Knight of the Fallen Empire and Knights of the Eternal Thronewhich sets up the storyline going forward In Knights of the Fallen Empireyour character becomes the leader of an Alliance of specialists and Force users in their attempt to bring down the Eternal Empirebut now with the ability to sabotage your original faction This means that there are four possible stories instead of just the two faction stories now; loyalist Republicsaboteur Republicloyalist Empireand saboteur Empirethereâ€™s a wide assortment of armors and weapons to craft And thanks to the Outfit Designeryou can keep multiple specific looks available to you and still keep your up to date armors with your highest stats possible And even though itâ€™s not part of the game right nowthe developers plan to eventually add weapons to the outfit designerbut the game also offers many opportunities to shape the stories as you see fit In addition to the previously mentioned loyalist/saboteur storylines that came from Onslaughtplayers can play a Light Side or Dark Side characterskill or let certain NPCs liveand depending on the classhave multiple endings For examplethe Sith Inquisitor can have one of 3 Sith titles given to them based on their alignment; Light SideDark Side and Neutral And given the current â€œcommit yourself to one side fo the Forceâ€ systemthe Neutral titleonce a painis easy to getand the best part is that you donâ€™t need to spend any money to experience most of it In 2012the game went to a free to play modeland with the release of Onslaughtthat gave free players access to more of the game Free players now have access to 60 levelsup from 50up to the Shadow of Revan expansionup from the vanilla gameand can now have access to 1 million creditsup from 200000 for completely free players and 350000 for preferred players And if new players want to see what comes after thatthey only need to subscribe for 1 month to permanently unlock everything up to the current expansionas well as all content to come with that expansionyouâ€™ve got nothing to lose but time for checking outI've never really enjoyed playing MMOsand I've tried [b]MANY[/b] of them Most of the time those games were Pay2Winwith bland combat mechanics and uninteresting story with generic quests such as ""kill 3 big ugly monsters"" or ""I'm too lazy to harvest a flower I really need to brew my potiongrab it for me""and so on4 Republic It took me around 15 hours to complete the PROLOGUE of my first classwithout even exploring a lot or doing a bunch of side quests And let me tell youthe story is fantastic and your choices matter It's a BioWare game after alltons of different playstyles and an unbelievable amount of content to keep you busy for a long whileGreetings from USA! I am Walter (or Fat gringo) and I have been playing SWTOR since one of its beta stages without breaks and time outs I would like to encourage you to give the game a try with this quick review belowwhile still being honest about the flaws of the game in its ""elderly age""and continue through the first digital expansions of the game up to level 60you could only subscribe for a month to get all of the story content unlocked forever for your account Howeveronce you approach the EndGameyou start feeling the limitations of the F2P model very hard Once you find out what it is like to play as a Subscriberyou may struggle to get back to Preferred status player (the middle limitation level) after your Sub expiresbut it shines in the group playespecially if you team up with guildies and have a voice chat available Be it casual or hardcoreraidingPvPingexplorationConquest - everything is more fun with friends in this game Play the class stories alone to immerse yourself fully into themthen join a guild or play with friends once you find yourself in the EndGame grindSWTOR struggles to offer continuously fresh and engaging content to some of the hard-core fans and veterans of the game I myself have been playing it since beta and have witnessed every single updatechangebright moments and failures over the years It's a thing to considerbut if you are reading this reviewyou are probably wondering if it's worth picking up the game YesabsolutelyIt's a MMO that people play for the storySpent three years of my life playing WoW; wish I'd been playing this insteadThe gameplay may be dated but this is the best Star Wars experience I've ever had It tells sprawling stories that the filmsbooksshowsand other games couldn't hope to capture It makes the galaxy far far away feel grander and more epic in scope than ever beforequestsand raidsnot just because of the stories it tells but the stories I have to tell of my journeys through the Old RepublicTreat it as a singleplayer with co-op options The storylines and dialogues are amazing and there is ton of people willing to help youafter allmost of us dont want to see such amazing game dieFor free you get 8 awesome base stories and some good side storiesall with classic BioWare choices F2P players also get to play some DLCsnot the best ones (those are behind the sub) but they are still good Wouldn't say that SWTOR is as good as the original two KOTOR gamesbut its enjoyable and gives back the Star Wars RPG feelingbut its nothing that will make the story quality lowerbut they dont affect the funfactorA MMORPG with more single player / co op story content than many single player RPGs The MMO stuff is there too The graphics are a bit dated and cartoonybut with KOTOR 3 nowhere in sight this is probably the way to go if you want to play a Star Wars RPG Plusyou can play on the Imperial side this timewhich is always a good thing"
1,In Risk of Rain 2 your entire goal is to become so powerful that you no longer have any indication of whats happening on screen.I love spending 9 hours just to get killed by a flying bell[h1] Don't play this game at night [/h1]with a great balance between new content based on what the community want and new content from their hands with regular updates.on the edge of my seat wondering if itll rain>Playing Mul-Tthe Character with a minigun.which make enemies explode when they die.I hit max difficulty with exactly 666 health.he explodesthe explosion is so powerful all 3 of the other bosses die.This game makes 2 hours feel like 1 minutes.Fantastic translation of the first game's formula from 2D to 3D. A complete improvement over Risk of Rain 1.Enjoyed RoR1and they actually managed to transform it from a 2d to 3dkeep the charmand take it to another level.

The characters are greatthe items are greatthe levels are great and they are working on it diligently.  I can't wait until it's complete.  Ohand co-op.  Yes.but gorgeous in terms of visual style.wellyou might like it anyway.I usually don't write reviews for gamesbut I had to make an exception for this. [b]TL;DR at the end[/b]henceforth ror2is a multiplayer (or singleplayer) 3D roguelikebullet hell game. Itâ€™s difficult to put this game into words for how unique it isbut thatâ€™s what makes it a great game.howeveryou very quickly unlock the rest of the cast through playing the game normally.Rainstormand Monsoon.I find that the difficulties are perfectly balanced. Rainstorm offers a nice â€œnormalâ€ experiencenot too easy or hard. If you want to relax and be laidbackthen drizzle is perfect for that. Andif you want a real challenge then you can get that through Monsoon.and learning the game is a breeze. Thatâ€™s something that was very noteworthy for me when first playing this game. I had zero experience playing the first gameyet within 1 minutes it felt like I already knew enough to succeed in the game.the games gameplay is already almost perfect.The only thing I know that would immediately improve the experience of the game would be fixing the bugswhich I will get to later.all of the songs currently in the game always fit the theme of ror2 so welland always sounds like itâ€™s the perfect song for whatever moment I am. I look forward to tracks theyâ€™ll be adding in the futureyou can quickly tell how big of a threat they are from looking at themwhile also being distinct enough to recognize what it is. They did a very good job on this aspect. When things start to get hecticyou need to be able differentiate what is whatand they accomplished that.I found that difficulty scaled really well. The only problem I encountered was one of my friends DCing part way throughand they were unable to rejoin once their internet fixed itself. Howeverthey allow you to play with each other with modswhich Iâ€™ll touch on next.the mod community is starting to flourish. The devs officially support modding of the gameand actually separate users based on if their game is modded or notwhich helps to mitigate anyone modding to appear in your quickplay lobbies. Some of the current mods include:while not too gamebreakingcan be a hindrance. There are only a couple of bugs that I myself am aware ofwhich are:respawning and taking damage.but have seen clips)all of these are known and they are working on them.this game is a masterpiece. THIS is what early access should be. A really solid experienceactive listening from the devsconsistent updates and acknowledgement of the communityand a drive to create a better game. Iâ€™ve enjoyed every part of this gameand there is a lot to it. Engaging boss fightsinteresting achievementsaddictive but not grindy gameplaymultiplayerand wonderful devs. I canâ€™t find a thing I dislike about this game. It was all beautifully executed and very well done. 1/1and his music was electric
1,"Backstory :  I started with MS Flightsim on an amber screened IBM clone in 1987. It took several 'disks' to loadand I would go make coffee and  drink most of it before it would be loaded and ready to play. Looking backit was simply atrocious. It had no graphics to speak ofran at less than 5 fpsand used a keyboard as input. In shortit was the equivalent of flying a very stubborn turkey.I mused - this will be real. One day places will look like it does in the real world. One day planes will feel like planesnot just an illusion of something clearly being tortured on a screen.37 years later'one day' is here.like the fact that the frame rate is inconsistentand it slows down substantially around massive built up areasor that the drone camera system is somewhat cumbersome and flight planning could be a lot more user friendly when adding or re-ordering waypoints. But these are minor. And  though I am sure they will be ironed outI could also live with the game as isbecause all the rest is just so far ahead of anything else I've ever seen. It not just greatits phenomenal.trying my best for years and yearsand I'm still rubbish at it. Howeverthis simulator is a quantum leap from the ones before. I can actually land every time without crashing when realism is maxed out.  The actual simulation of flight systems and avionics has been vastly improvedmaking it so much easier to hand fly aircraft  than in previous iterations.  It actually feels like you are flying a planenot a simulation.  It actually feels like you are in your hometown when flying over it. (And no - that house you are flying into looks nothing like your actual house. In fact it could be mine.  )makes me so unbelievably happy. It gives me untold pleasure to admit: ""Its finally here and its better than I ever imagined possible""whenfor $6I can go fly anywhere in a faithfully recreated virtual copy the world. Fly over a place and exclaim: ""This actually does look like it does in real life."" How ungrateful would I be If I lamented the hours and hours it took to downloadwhenby the end of itthe whole world exists on a little setup in the corner of my lounge.  Honestlysome people.and its simply mind blowing.I'll post a full review later but just wanted to warn anyone out there that after buying the game you download a ~6MB launcher. The game itself is a ~9GB download from that launcher. The problem isthe launcher being open appears to being counted as play timeso just a heads up if you were thinking to return it if you don't like it. Butbased on everything I've seenit's clear that this is going to be a phenomenal simbut just wanted to let people know.for those of youlike mewho are installing this to a secondary drivenote that your main drive (C:\) will need to have at least 8.4GB free as it uses a ""Rolling Cache"" that's located in %AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft Flight Simulatorat least in my caseI came back and it looked as though the launcher had frozen at 15% (thatâ€™s where I left it when I locked my PC). I exited the launcher and reopened Microsoft Flight Simulator via Steam to learn it had fully installed. Important thing to noteI didnâ€™t put my PC to sleep overnightI just locked it and made sure it wouldnâ€™t automatically put itself to sleep by changing the sleep setting in Windows Settings.I'm a sport pilot so fly in real lifehere's what I can tell everyone else about VR and MSFS22.  Using a reverb G2 and flight yoke and throttle.or it has to many levelsor my airport is not depicted just right - but when you step back and look at the big picture this is a gigantic leap forward for flight simmers.I can tell you that the at times tonight for moments I literally lost reality and felt like I was flying in real lifethe sim can be that realisticof course the windnoiseand vibrations-turbulence are missing from the feedbackbut in VR it immerses the senses even more making those points above even less noticeable while flying.how good the sim is compared to real life and again while it would be easy to complain about various things - wow a jump forward for flight simmers! There are times while in the traffic pattern I'll turn downwindbaseor on final and look down and out the window and I get that same feeling as real flyingI literally forget I'm in the sim because the terrain and building match up close enough to trick the mind. Performance wise it may be running better in VR than on my triple screensstill to be determined.many have hangersFBO'sor other vital landmarks missing. Example at airport 2a the FBOone set up of public hangersand Tuskegee Airman hanger is missingnot sure how because that is certainly big enough to show up on maps. The closer to real life they can make this that much more immersive it's going to be for those who have flown over areas.specific to VR very impressed! The fact it can make me forget I'm at a computer at times and not in the actual plane is something no flight sim as done before. I highly recommend this and can tell you from a visual perspective it's highly realistic and in VR that much more immersive.had to cancel gamepass and buy the game on steam in order to play it the way I wanted.I am a real-life private pilot. This game is not only beautifulbut accurately represents a large portion of my time in the air. The detail within this sim truly allows for realistic VFR flights to be performed like never before.especially when coming in on final at an uncontrolled airfield.but more than enough to get you started on your journey through FS22.Before you buy the game hereI'd recommend that you try it through the Xbox Game Pass where you can get it for $1 a month on your first monthotherwise $6 a month. If you download it through Xbox Game Passyou can also use the downloaded files through the launcher on the Steam version if that is how you want to go about it later on. The sim itself is fantastic and I feel that it was well worth the wait. I'll update this with a full review later on when I get more hands on experience with the simulator.I wanted to give my inputs on how I feel about the simulator.is simply the best we've had in a flight simulator. For the longest timeclouds rendered in simulators like P3D or X-Plane 11 were 2D and flat (albeit now P3D has TrueSky which significantly improves their clouds) but with FS22we are finally able to get an overhaul to one of the most significant problems in flight simulation.these issues will be sorted out with their weather provider meteoblue. The gusts however are great with the frequency being shown and able to be adjusted. Gives the wind a more ""alive"" feel.it felt as if you were on rails. The aerodynamics are not comparable to X-Plane 11 which I feel has the better flight model (though it does feel too exaggerated). Flying in the third person camera however feels kind of arcade-like which is dislike but I enjoy flying more in the cockpit than I do flying in the third person camera. I feel the aerodynamics will need some work done on them as planes tend to be tail heavy in my experience with them pitching up too much upon touchdown.missing features in the GPS systems such as in the G1 where it can make it difficult or near impossible to fly with them on networks like PilotEdge or VATSIMand just general performance issues. They look really nice but don't have the greatest functionality but they are just default aircraft so it is to be expected that not everything works in them. They should howevertry to make really good avionics. Kind of like how X-Plane 11 has a fully functional G1GNS43 and GNS53 avionics systems as they work really well and are included by default. Most payware planes will end up using the default avionics and having strong base avionics is a must in a simulator in my opinion.glass cockpits suffer hard on performance). The game really needs you to have a beefy computer to run it optimally. The best place to test your performance is in a major city like JFK.I'm enjoying the simulator and love to just fly around with my friends and do FSEconomy flights here and there. It is an enjoyable experience so far and with the team wanting to support the game for a long timeI have hope that many of these issues will be fixed.I can now fly over my house at 4 FPSCrashed a 747 into my ex girlfriends house. 1/1[b]---Note to anyone getting slow download speed----[/b]uninstall launcherand delete all folders and files in C:\Users\USERNAME\appdata\roaming\Microsoft Flight Simulator\ and retryEncountered another player flying around Jefferey Epstein's island 1/1---{Graphics}---found my cheating ex's homecrashed into her living room1/1 gameFor a second the airplanes sounded super realistic...then I realized it was my PC.Quick disclaimer: I have real life flight training and I have my real life flight hours.cities with AI buildings also look coolbut of course they aren't entirely modeled.as well as the autopilot. These are extremely complex systems and quite honestlyI would be extremely surprised if they got some study-material aircraft perfectly at launch. Physics wise this is also very interesting. It's still not perfectbut it's getting better. Topographic turbulence and weather changes are becoming somewhat realistic.this is obviously a classic and will become the new industry standard. If you are here for big planes and exact real life proceduresyou might want to do that when third parties start releasing their products.go take a cub and explore your surroundings.I created a 747 flight from JFK to LAX.>Went to North Korea at nightReview after 6 hours - 22 Sept. 29:sonot stressful when people just ignore the rules)beautiful and immersive Flight Simulator today for PCbut since we're talking about the entire earth -> it is already amazing and awesome.. justnot finished. Sonot a bad ""con"".and can crash your plane easily.but that's logically to be expected ;-)since that's enormous work to be doneand much of it will be added later and / or can be bought from community modders.if you can live with not trusting the autopilot yet and wanna learn and enjoyI recommend you buy. The game is already awesome.where you have to switch and change valuesand change and re-activate them backjust so the computer acknowledges the values you've selected.Alt to 3ftV/S +1 per minuteI'm at 25k ft29kts. Autopilot descends 6ft/min dives downgoes beyond 36kts beyond safety and I have to disable it before it crashes my plane..). You can't reproduce this every timebut it happens way to often.until it settles. You have 2 systems competing with each other. Auto-thrust tries to keep the plane at the correct speed. The climb/descend angle has an influence on that and vice verseso you have 2 systems constantly correcting each otherbumping up and downwasting fuel..it has a lot of trouble just holding. Not alwaysbut many timesin midst of flightAutopilot Altitude ""Hold"" leads to ascending 5/mindescending 5/minand repeat 1 times.and one can configure the autopilot ""unwisely""but the state it is in nowwhen I fly from Paris to New YorkI actually have a way safer flight and burn less fuelif I manually adjust pitch trim and thrust myselfthan using the autopilot. That shouldn't be.that bug fixes are rolled out repeatedlyto improve those details.there are just a few elements on the displaysthat are wrong / show the wrong signal for specific settings and so on. (e.g. airbusdisplay still showing climb even when a different mode is active). We've got a really great community herewilling to help. If we eventually could have the authentic behavior of the real on-board systems/computersthat would be absolutely amazing ! Cheers everyone---{Graphics}---most realistic visual and pilots eye from cockpit simulation available (I am a jet pilot with 1 hours) . sounds are good but need improvement. fantastic base for the future patches and versions to comeAs an avid flight simulator enthusiast and student pilot in real lifeI would certainly recommend this simulator. The graphics are top notcha huge upgrade from FSX. HoweverI'm surprised to notice that MSFS does not include an instant replay optionpost-flight analysisnor does it include flight manuals; I have to google certain flight parameters. All of which have been included in previous versions. I hope Microsoft takes note of these flaws. Nonethelessit is a very fun and enjoyable simulator. I can attribute my success as a student pilot to using these simulators over the years.1/1 saw my house"
1,"As a historical novelist and former high school English teacher with over 700 books in my home devoted to ancient Greek literaturehistory and culture I had to try this gameIâ€™m not a fan of â€˜gopherâ€™ games that make you run around collecting itemsrescuing damsels in distressdelivering messagesand murdering politicians to level your character  The whole premises seems rather tedious and unimaginativeand I am not the most nimble finger clickerI was prepared to spend a good portion of my playing time getting my head lopped offyeahthere is a pretty steep learning curve here  I did spend a lot of my initial hours zigging when I should have been zaggingand with my opponentâ€™s spear in my headbut I stuck with it and eventually even an old poop like me was able to figure out the mechanicsSpartaArgosMycenaeDelosAeginaHydraCreteMelos (now Santorini)and dozens of other locales on the campaign map multiple times  Iâ€™ve walked around the ruins at Delphistrolled the docks of Piraeus and walked through valley of Laconia for research for my books  I wanted to see these places at they might have looked 2500 years ago and that for me is the true joy of Assassinâ€™s Creed Odysseyyouâ€™d expect to see historical figures like PericlesSocratesAlcibiades and Archidamas in a game about the Peloponnesian War  But that anyone outside of academia even knows who BrasidasAspasiaHerodotus and Pausanias wereis impressive  Kudos to youErechtheion and Parthenon as they were shiny and newinstead of in piles of rubble  I wanted to gaze up at Phidias' statue of Zeus in Olympus (one of the wonders of the ancient Greek world that no longer exists)speak to the Pythia at the temple of Delphiand see the five villages of Sparta as they might have looked  Getting to walk the streets of AthensArgos and Elis was like taking a trip back in time  Magicalthe game isnâ€™t perfect  The pronunciation of common names like Pericles and Socrates and the characterâ€™s accents were maddening  I can only guess that Ubisoft believes weâ€™ve Americanized the real pronunciationsor at least I hope thatâ€™s what they were thinking  Ultimately itâ€™s a minor annoyanceguess you canâ€™t have everythingbut have no connection to the Agiad royal family  By rights they should have been Pausaniasâ€™ cousinsbut theyâ€™re not  I donâ€™t know who they are The whole Pythagoras-is-my-father thing is rather bizarre and makes no sense at allas it serves no purpose  Suffice it to say that I enjoyed the gameget drunk and sing songs with Socrates at an Athenian symposiumfeel the Aegean Sea roll beneath your feet on the deck of a  triremeor stare out in wonder at the lights twinkling over Attica at twilighttry this game  You wonâ€™t be disappointedAfter my experience with AC: OriginsI was reluctant to buy this game It looked almost the same as Origins to meand as somebody who wasn't particularly fond of Originsthat wasn't a good sign NeverthelessI had quite a bit of money left in my Steam wallet so I decided to buy itmade it betterand threw in some of its own stuff as well It feels a lot more fleshed out than any of the previous games in the entire franchisethe game world is beautifully designed I loved Origins' game worldbut I have to say that Odyssey's game world is a lot better It is a lot more vibrantand it is incredibly easy to get lost in it There are plenty of things to do and plenty of places to exploremaking travel between them not too much of a hassle The map is huge I'm 76 hours in and I haven't fully discovered it all yet The amount of detail they put into it is nothing short of incrediblealthough not perfectare still better from previous gamesaside from a few over-exaggerated animations My main issue in the graphical department is the poor rendering Textures can sometimes fail to load in properly and the draw distance is far from impressiveso for my playthrough I chose Kassandra Either wayyou play as a mercenary in ancient Greece during the Pelponesian Wara time of great struggle between the Athenians and the Spartansand after that I found myself hooked There are three story branches that the game has you follow You acquire these new branches as you progress through the story I'm not going to talk about these branches in this review because I honestly think you should discover what they are for yourselves when you play this What they areand the way they are revealedare brilliant The more you go through the gamethe more content is available to you It can get overwhelming sometimesbut the things you say do have consequencesnot really Once you reach the half way point of the gameit begins to fall a bit flat It's not that it becomes badit's just not as good The level of mystery begins to become a bit stale and the structure of the main quests begins to be a little repetitive You find yourself having to do other needless things before being able to do the main questwhich can get annoying As well as this the ending to the main story branch is a bit weakand honestly a bit cheesywhich was something that was incredibly forgetable in Origins It's still not that greatbut it's more interesting in Odyssey and the conclusion to it is excellentthe story overall is goodand that goes for all three story branches The writing in Odyssey is engaging and I find myself liking the missions and the characterswhich is something that Origins struggled to do for meyou will notice a lot of similarities when it comes to gameplay The combat is very similarand some of the other game mechanics that were in Origins are present in Odyssey as well What makes them different in Odysseyis that they've been drastically improved The game has fully embraced its RPG side which means it isn't holding back on anythingor exploration mode Guided mode is essentially what Origins was with a compass and icons pointing to where you need to go Exploration mode removes all of this and makes you figure out where you need to go with the tips you've been given from talking to people or finding notes or letters This makes the game a lot more challenging and serves as a way more memorable experience to say the leastthe combat is really entertaining You can fight using a variety of different weapons and the introduction of combat abilities makes these fights a lot more exhilarating You gain a skill point each time you level up which can be used to invest in these abilitiesresulting in the whole thing looking goofy Assassination executions can sometimes screw you over and get you spotted by other enemieswhich can get pretty annoyingbut Odyssey has done it almost perfectly It's simpleand it can be really exciting Your ship can be upgraded using resourcesand the more you upgradethe better your ship can sustain itself During your travelsyou can recruit new people to join your ship These people will give your ship bonuses and will assist you in boarding other shipsyou need to weaken the hold of the controlling faction Once a conquest battle is unlockedyou can begin a massive battle that will decide who controls the region You have the ability to choose which side you want to be withOdyssey introduces bounty hunters If you commit a crime and it has been witnessedyou risk placing a bounty on yourself This will send a bounty hunter after you They are smart and very powerfuland can show up when you least expect itthis was a major issue in Originsand almost made me give up on it Throughout my playthroughI rarely had the need to grindand when I didit was hardly any hassle for me at allas the ways you can level up are plentiful and entertaining The amount of XP you gain increases the more you level upwhich is a brilliant way to tackle grind If you don't rushyou shouldn't have an issueI'm really pleased with this game I'm glad it didn't end up being an Origins 20 The writing is good and the characters are memorable The game world is stunning and is filled with things to do The only things that drag this game down for me are the poor rendering and the poor mid-late story pacing If you're willing to pay the price tagthis is definitely a game you shouldn't missbe sure to give it a like! I'm still learning :)Judging whether or not youâ€™ll want to play this game is most easily done by comparing it to its direct predecessorAssassinâ€™s Creed Originswith which Odyssey shares a lot of its DNAand the setting of Ancient Egypt is wonderfulbut [url=https://steamcommunitycom/id/greatjon_umber/recommended/582160/]I found there to be severe flaws in the foundation of what that game does regarding stealthcombatand story[/url] Typically with an Assassinâ€™s Creed game I expect a great core experience that often lacks polish in terms of stability due to the grueling yearly release schedule from Ubisoft that doesnâ€™t allow adequate QA time to fix such things With Originsit was the oppositeâ€”The core experience was lesser than Syndicateâ€™sbut the game was very polished It ran well and looked gorgeousfull of people raving about its wonderful setting and graphics while neglecting the deeper issues the game had at its core Odysseythenreminds me a lot of what Syndicate was to Unity;

chiefly Athens and Sparta Odysseyâ€™s modified version of the Nemesis system depicts what feels like a livingbreathing war going on around you Athens and Sparta change territory through the story and your actionswith each cityâ€™s forces being easily identifiableand each occupying different fortresses as they move They have leaderscities you can disruptmoney and materiel you can steal and destroy There are various war leaders and mercenaries that function as the actual Nemeses from the Shadow gamesand somehow the team has made this system feel more natural in an Assassinâ€™s Creed game than the Lord of the Rings games which inspired it Itâ€™s the main draw of Odysseyand itâ€™s a huge one It all works smoothlyindicative of significant polishand the game is worth playing just to experience it even if you were burnt out on Originsand itâ€™s a fantastic quality-of-life addition There are also now non-lethal takedowns and enemy recruitingdeepening stealth gameplayand Origins taking that away really damaged the experience for me They are now back as a map featureallowing you to hover over map markers for a brief paragraph of backgroundthough The balance of the game is offrequiring a bit too much grinding if youâ€™re not clearing every map marker like I am The leveling system is also far too rigidturning enemies one level higher than you into health sponges This should be addressed in a future balance patch It didnâ€™t affect me much because Iâ€™m always overleveledbut I could see how someone focused only on the main story would become frustratedwhich is puzzling in a game about Greek combatâ€”A style of combat based almost wholly on the use of a heavy bronze shield I loved the shields in Origins and am puzzled and disappointed to see them gomuch of Odyssey looks the same as Origins: The menus are nearly identical You have a pet bird to scout with The running and climbing animations are the same The buildings look similar The graphics are of the same quality But these similarities--like the critical praise for Origins--are only surface-deepand itâ€™s become one of my favorites in the seriesI'm not saying its as good as the Witcher 3[b]I bought the Gold Editionwhich seems to have a better valuethe Hourglass mountand the spear ""Harvester of Time"" - this pack gives more warrior damage boostand the Dusk Blood Offering sword - this pack is more stealth focusedTHE FATE OF ATLANTIS and bonus mission The Secrets of Greece + The Games: Assassin's Creed III REMASTERED and Assassin's Creed Liberation REMASTEREDthe only difference between Gold and Ultimate Edition is that Ultimate has the Deluxe Edition Content Unless you want to spend extra money to receive the deluxe pack for temporary xp boost and some armor and skins (the armour looks really cool and is useful after level 5 and not really useful after level 8 - upgrading it at the blacksmith takes too much resources and there is much better armor later on; up to you to buy Ultimate vs Gold Edition - price difference is not as big when on salethough I bought Gold Edition) then I'd suggest you to get the Gold Edition[/i][b]meaning if you buy the base game or the Gold Edition and decide you want the Deluxe Edition later - you will be rebuying the game again with the Deluxe/Ultimate Editionand that's money wasted Buying the base game with the intention to buy Season Pass or any of the other editions later onis not worth it at all either - buy Ultimate Edition to have absolutely everything or buy the Gold Edition to have everything important gameplay-wise You are saving money and getting the best of the gameand available only through Assassin's Creed III Remastered Soin order to play Liberation Remasteredyou need to launch Assassin's Creed III Remastered Both Remasters are slightly better graphicallythan their previous versionsbefore trying to launch the remastered content because Ubisoft Connect needs to load the content that comes with the Gold/Ultimate Edition Otherwisethe Ubisoft client will ask you for a cd key activationwhich is not possible anymorethe info will help youso you don't have to look around various sites or contact the terrible support teamsfeel free to check my Assassin's Creed Black Flag Review -[/b] https://steamcommunitycom/id/brake_id/recommended/242050/[h1]Overall Score: 91 / 10[/h1]@ 60 HzinterfacegraphicsOK with KB+M (butsimplebut quickly respondingsimplewhich increase enemyHP and dmg;

I think that I've enjoyed the origins graphics more - especially the sync point viewsespecially considered to everything after AC IIIbut sadly not as good as the desmond story which I really enjoyedbut it does not affect the story or any stats like a male is strongerbut not as agile as a femalethe GTA wanted system and the shadow of war nemesis system It's a nice ideabut I often felt interrupted at discoveringbut it doesn't really matterbut it's mostly the same thing gameplaywise Kill this personsteal somethingtalk to a person and so onbut only after level 50but without new skills or something like that Lazy and latebut sadly the game isn't that great optimized Most settings barely boost your fps I'm getting a stable 60 fps at almost max settings I've tested it on different CPUs and my GTX 1070 This is definitely not that great especially considered that it does need 10-20% more performance than originsalthough it doesn't look better Everything else was fine for me I didn't have any serious bugsit didn't crash or freeze The loading times on an SSD are finebut you still have to be at least 3 levels under your enemieswhich does make it pretty pointlessyou have to do a lot of side quests to level up It does throw you out of the storywhich is really badbut of courseit's definitely nothing which belongs in a full price game!but it's way too much You have to upgrade your gear like every 10-20minbut still expensive)I do like every AC game I do think that every part does have something special and their up and downs It's also my favorite game franchise That's also a big reason why I wanted to wait until I've finished the whole game before I do share my opinion I had a lot of fun with this gamebut much more to donew and improved thingsexcept things as graphics and performance It's the better game gameplaywisebut not storywiseno assassinsand no templars So No How could it even be? It's before the brotherhood has been created BUT why yes? Well""sadly"" it's still an Assassin's Creed even if it is not the same feeling as for an example in the Ezio Trilogycause of the isuthe antic artifacts and present storyI would only! buy it on sale now I've bought the Gold Edition to play before release Buy the season pass/gold edition if you can't get enough The season pass includes the 2 DLC's and AC III and Liberation remasteredbut with 3h per episode to complete everything way too short If I am honest and hard it's like almost every DLC these days it just feels like free content for money Soyou can skip it if you had enough of odysseyI've heard that each episode takes about 10-12hbut I can't confirm that It does add a new area and took me about 18 hours to complete everything It has been great More mythological stuffbut that's what I honestly expected for the main gameadded automatic arrow craftinga story creator modethe discovery tourweekly eventswhich are repetitiveeasy and nothing special at alla visual customization systema mastery systemand many other thingswhich expand the game for free The performance(balancing) and other negative points are sadly the sameI really do like the game It's a good gamebut the worst! Assassin's Creed For meit was the GOTY 2018 for PC!but sadly you can't write more in the reviewThis game made me book a holiday to Greece and visit the ancient sites- roughly 80+ hours for the full storyie people of your level are a challenge in groupbe under leveled and you'll get you ass handed to yoube over leveled and you'll be doing the ass kicking (although the game does scale up as you level up)up closeor assassination or even in combination with each otherkill someone and move up in ranks although if you are being hunter it does get ridiculous sometimes if you have 4 mercenaries hunting your ass at the same time [spoiler]you're better off paying off your bounty at that point[/spoiler]who doesn't love a good ass handing with a [spoiler]minotaur[/spoiler] or [spoiler]cyclops[/spoiler]I love these kind of games (open world / rpg) that have a lot of diversion and things to work ondoesn't get repetitive or boringyou can always switch to doing something elseI'll keep it short and sweetor who'll want to do the same to youall kinds of them with all kinds of things and stuff in themin which your lieutenants are chosen by your hand in battle and now fight for your glorymake them rulers of parts of the world and gain mighty gear and weaponsmuch more in factthat epic story is for you to find outI never thought I'd think much of it WellOdyssey has straightened me outjust let your true spirit free and dive into ancient Greece and intoI tamed a wolf Named him and had great adventures with him That all ended when some Spartan soldier killed him[h1]Pros[/h1]exploration etc)but daggers are clearly the bestOdyssey's greatest strength is also its greatest weakness: [b]Bloat[/b] Far too many points of interest in the game are simply duplicatedand thus pointless to visit: Same campsfilled with the same enemieswith the same layoutsand same chests While I visited every point of interest in OriginsI have to say I simply didn't bother with many of the locations in Odyssey I wouldn't recommend visiting them eitherunless mindless repetition is right up your alleyhas to be the annoying RPG system I played the game on Hard with enemy level scaling Because of thatgear has to be constantly upgraded in order to be relevantand upgrades cost a LARGE amount of money and resources which require grinding Raising the level cap to 99 was also a massive mistake on Ubisoft's part as wellbecause leveling basically made the game harder I only really had full ""end game"" gear after close to 100 hours of gameplaystats are extremely important Not having 100% crit chance from your equipment basically takes away guaranteed assassination killswhich is an insult to a game in the ASSASSIN's Creed franchise I can't say I enjoyed the direction Ubisoft chose here Perhaps it would be best to simply call this game ""Greek Mercenary: Odyssey""and Origins is easily my favourite installment Origins had just the right amount of content; the points of interest actually served a pointand the obscure locations gave you cool equipment I also found Egypt to have the better looking landscape as compared to Greece It also didn't have the obnoxious RPG stat system either But perhaps I'm biasedseeing as the game that preceded Origins happens to be the worst installment in the franchiseif you couldn't afford to play bothI'd still recommend Odyssey solely based on bang for buck You simply cannot go wrong with the sheer amount of content provided in this installmentdespite it being the greatest departure from the franchise [b]9/10[/b]you can sparta kick people off of cliffsBUY IT IF- 1) you like RPG's and want a vibrant world to dive in2) are an AC fan for your collection(Thank god that damn shield from Origins is gone ! :Palthough some people did love the shield based combat i know) Free running is also pretty darn easy nowKassandra/Alexios can pretty much climb any damn object no matter how jagged/smooth it is The quests sometime get pretty boring and repetitive (Go someplacekill some thugsrescue XXX from bandits) and as you level upkilling bad guys becomes more and more routine and easy thanks to unlocked abilities The Naval Combat system feels refreshed and its fun to ram ships around and roam freely Overallgood improvements herei found the storyline to be a bit dull when compared to Originseven though the protagonists are well designed and animatedthey sometimes feel hollow (Maybe due to not such a great story?) There are some fun moments and interesting characters though ;)Even if you're running it at medium-high settingsOdyssey is a treat to watch and the option to switch to travel speed when travelling via ship showcases the amazing lighting and water quality of the ocean from a spectacular anglethe character quality and facial animations have certainly improved Overall a treat to watch and experience ancient Greece in a beautiful way If you can run it at ultraeven betteryou'll be somewhat disappointed as there are not much ""Assassin's Creed-staple"" features in the game Instead of earlier AC games's emphasis on sneaking inyou can always barge insword and spear blazing but ultimately its up-to you what approach you takequite a few amazing creatures/monsters to battle with as you level up and on the other hand several menial tasks likefetching wine and helmets as well A good balance you think? if you cant decideread the starting para of this review againit may help :P77 hours inI have reached level 42 and I'm not close to finishing the main storynot even half way Too busy completing side quests and everything else in this huge and incredibly beautiful game Every time I decide to go for a main quest something else comes in the way And to be honestI do procrastinate the main story because I don't want Kassandra's story to end I'm pretty confident to say that Assassin's Creed Odyssey is the best game in the series followed by Assassin's Creed Origins and Assassin's Creed 2the storythe music and soundthe combatthe skillsthe RPG elementsthe world and how stunning and different every area is Just as in Originsthe world feels so aliveif not a tiny bit more in this one Take the time to listen to conversations around you and watch what people are doingit can be pretty funny at timesAssassin's Creed Odyssey is a masterpieceYes sure it's not following the other AC series and it's not actually a Assassin's creed but it's a wonderful game; Here's why:I liked it enough to play it for 5400 hoursso yeah it rocks"
1,"[h1]Fallout: New Vegas[/h1]and since then I've played nearly 1500 hours of it across 12 playthroughs of ~120 hours each It is my favorite game of all timebut not necessarily because of nostalgia Fallout: New Vegas hasto my mindnever been surpassed in its pairing of roleplaying [i]and[/i] narrative flexibilityby any game since its release - and I've played The Witcher 3so you know this game must have something special Thereforethat's what this review [i]must[/i] provemost of everything you [i]need[/i] to know about the plot of New Vegas is laid out for you in one of Fallout's many iconic slideshowsbut if you are entirely new to the franchiseI'd suggest clicking [url=https://wwwyoutubecom/watch?v=nvqm_pPD-aQ]here[/url] OtherwiseI'll just state that New Vegas is much more connected to the stories of Fallout's 1 & 2 than 3 or 4due to it being set on the West Coastand is in some ways a continuation of the story from Fallout 2 The restI'd rather not spoil Althoughin this specific Fallout You are a courierhired by the Mojave Expressto deliver a package to the New Vegas Strip What seemed like a simple delivery job has taken a turn for the worsethe character you create can essentially be [i]anyone you want them to be[/i] If you have the ability to coherently write a characterFNV becomes your own narrative playground; one of my favorite elements of the game The character creation tools presented at the start of the game are suitably expansive as well; between skillstagsand traits Further progression in New Vegas is also superbas you raise your skills accordingly and select from many game-alteringor at least usefulperks The character creation and progression in FNV is exemplarychoicesconsequencesand other roleplaying mechanics to be found These systems all work together in perfect harmonywhich puts real weight behind your actions This could even mean small actionssuch as how you talk to a companion changing their character arc Speaking of talkingthe dialogue system is especially of noteas this is where most decisions are madeand where you express the personality of your character There are always a stunning amount of choices you can makeand you'll never feel like a viable option was left out - in any situation Many of your decisions even leave lasting effects on the Mojavewhich I'll explain in greater detail later onas you can choose from one of four main factions to end the game withas well as affect nearly two dozen other minor factions - either by aiding or hindering them Each organization has their own backstory and loreand all of them have quest lines worth delving into These groups will remember how you treat themwhich builds a lasting relationship between them and the player It's these dynamic factions that really bring the world to life through their thematic depthand give the Mojave a lived-in feelI'd like to highlight why it's my favorite game Because of how incredibly detailed and lore-dense the Fallout series isthe jaw-dropping amount of narrative flexibility in New Vegas is what seals the deal for me The ability to shape the Mojave as I see fita world that is so well realizedis unbelievably tantalizing to me; and I don't think any RPG has handled this better It makes me feel like such a tour de forcethat it's my character making these monumental decisionsand changing the future of a whole region - foreverclearlyand the desolate design of this setting establishes a highly authentic apocalyptic atmosphere I find the vanilla graphics to be timeless because of thisbut mods can certainly modernize them The region is a joy to explore tooas there are countless locations with pieces of environmental storytellingquestsand loot within them There's also an optional hardcore modewhich makes these barren wastes just that much harder to surviveI'll quickly state that almost every side-quest in New Vegas is spectacular They were crafted with the utmost attention to detailas they all have several ways to progress through them; and sincerely thoughtful writing applied to them Each storyline has a distinct and often original motifwhich makes them all a pleasure to play and experiencewho all share one thing in common; purpose Every follower has their own questsbackstoriesand motivating factors that make them relatable to the playerand from even the most minor of (named) characters to the most importanteveryone has identifiable personality traits No one feels like wasted potential These honest personas are what grounds your adventures in FNVby making you truly care about the Mojave and its inhabitantsFallout: New Vegas' combat is funbut also clunky Shootingstabbingbludgeoningdisintegratingand exploding your adversaries is what you'll spend most of your time doing when not exploring the wastes or having a pleasant chatand this level of variety is where the strength of the combat lies Just because it's clunkydoesn't mean there isn't visceral joy to be had The VATS system has also returnedbut I don't personally use it In essence the combat is just good enough to impressbut moddingwhich I'll mention latercan improve in considerablyundeniablyits performance This is almost entirely the engine's fault; Bethesda have never been known for their technical aptitude in games creation - and Obsidian had to make do Minor bugs run rampantas well as crashes if you don't make necessary tweaks to the ini fileswhich you can look up to discover what I'm talking about The game also stutters oftenbut mods can alleviate this issue for the most part My advice would be to save oftenand install a few modswhich is the next topicand the post-Fallout 3 series in generalis its customizability Anything from simple fixes to new questsand visual overhauls to gameplay tweaks can be added to the gameand to do this I'd recommend the [url=http://wwwnexusmodscom/newvegas/?]FNV Nexus[/url] I'd suggest watching some tutorials on how to mod the gameand from there NVSENVSRNVACand Project Nevada are all essential mods as far as I'm concernedbut it's up to you Visual mods are also welcomehowever they're subjective so I won't recommend any here All considered; [i]modding[/i]: a useful skill for any FNV playerbut what it does do correctly is simply exactly what I want from a game The roleplayingdecision makingcharactersworldlorenarrative - and so much morejust binds together into such a cohesive package of everything I ask for from an open world RPGthat I can't resist it's call Andif I remember correctly (but of course I doI could never forget)it sounds a little like

to Play Fallout: New Vegas âœ§id rather play fallout new vegas than support my kidsThe Wild West meets the Fallout Post Apocalyptic world and a great game is bornbut many different factions are

are about to be thrown into the middle of it What will you do?hilarious dialogue and so many entertaining quests that it would be hard to do them all in a single play through The DLC adds many more hours of fun although it is quite varied in flavour and in valuebut all of them are worth playing at least once The exception might be Lonesome Roadwhich most people loved but I had some issues withespecially with one decision it forces you to take that I felt was not one any of my characters would ever have made But Old World Blues may be my favourite DLC for any game ever The first fifteen

a little awkwardlywhile the open world is often littered with a lot of tinycluttered textures although it gets a pass from me since it's pretty believable that a post-apocalyptic world isn't squeaky clean of dirt and grime The lighting is okay but some indoor areas are pretty dark so be sure to use your pipboy light oftenyou wake up and discover that you have been rescued and nursed back to full health From therethe main story has you follow up on your mystery assassin in order to figure out what he stole from you and why he wants itthere is a larger plot unfolding as political tension is rising in the major factions residing in the Mojave wasteland There is an escalating conflict about land dispute as the NCR are expanding eastwards into Nevada attempting to establish order and law to the ""lawless"" desert while the Legion are expanding westwards trying to take over territory while committing acts of mass murder and enslaving any survivors they encounter There are a multitude of other factions that are interconnected in this political war such as the Great Khansa tribe of warriors that has repeatedly been weakened and pushed out of their homes by the NCRand the Brotherhood of Steela group of people obsessed with controlling technology that are in hiding due to a previously fight with the NCR where they were outnumbered and also pushed out of their residencewho is rumored to be in control of the New Vegas strip which is home to a wealthy and profitable gambling scene but nobody has ever seen him and he is somehow in control of a large army of robots that do his bidding Although the story begins with you having a multitude of questionsas you continue to play you understand how all of these factions interactwhy they like or dislike each otherand what kind of middle grounds they are willing to meet onif anyin order to solve this dilemmayou get a much better idea of their relationships and attitudes towards others and more notablythe factions of the Mojave Particularlythe companionVeronicahas like 50+ lines of dialogue about who she iswhat her goal isher relationship to her faction familyhow she feels about her enemy factionsand how she even feels about youand the game will account for it accordingly! If you meet up with an NPC that is part of a quest chain that you are followingbut you decide to kill him/herthere is more often than not an alternate way to proceed in the questor the game will account for that death in a later questline and see that you killed the NPC and proceed with the quest under that circumstance Perhaps most importantlyyou have the complete freedom to play as a villain in a Fallout game If you want toyou can be a complete knob to everybodykill everyone you dislikeand align yourself with villainous factions to aid them in their political agenda Your relationship will deteriorate with anyone that dislikes your actionsbut you have that choice to pursue if you so desirethe tunes immerse you in the feeling that you are actually a nomadic wanderer travelling the desert with a gun at your side (unless Johnny Guitar is being played)standard firearmsexplosivesand tech weapons that use laser and plasma technologysome of them being unmarked and up to you to discover off the beaten path Exploration is to your benefitbut the game feels like it doesn't agree and your shot proceeds to miss entirely Some weaponsnamely the bigger ones like a missle laucherdon't really have a proper aim/iron-sighted assist to make your shots line up more accuratelythe game suffers from a small voice cast You will probably hear many NPC's recycle the same voice actor throughout the game The voices are greatalbeit a little too frequently used among the different NPC's so to speak I swear to youYuri Lowenthal voices all but a single man in the Brotherhood of Steel bunkermoreso if you are afraid of LARGE insectssome sections of the game will likely give you either a moment of terror orat worstnightmares Humongous irradiated insects roam the wasteland often in packs and are littered all over in hives making themselves feel at home in dark caves underground Most of them are optionalbut just be wary of surprises at any timeI only wrote this review for awards"" is a waste of everyone's time If you are interested in genuine & detailed game reviewsfeel free to check out my others [b][u][url=https://steamcommunitycom/id/bonafidemonafide/recommended/]here[/url][/u][/b] (or don'tI don't tell you what to do)Fallout: ""I need to find a water chip""Please for the love of god let obsidian make more fallout gamesOver 800 hours and i still dont know how to play caravanObsidian: ""I'll just make my own Fallout with blackjack and hookers""please listen to the radioi want another obisdian fallout gameI dont' care who the NCR sends I am not paying taxes!To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine daydidn't have too much to sayno one dared to make a slipcame the whisper from each lipmade it plain to folks aroundwouldn't be too long in town20 men had made a slipit was time for them to meeteverybody held their breathhe might have went on living but he made one fatal slipbig ironI drank water from toilet to increase healthOne of my all-time favourite gamesI really enjoyed it and I spent manymany hours playing this The huge amount of choicesfactions and playstyles the game gives youmakes you want to experience every single one The story may be a bit weak and the graphics a bit rusty (same engine as Fallout 3) This is however beaten by an awesome gameplay (modable weapons!)a brilliant atmosphere set in sin citynevada and its surroundings and also 4 high quality DLCs (I strongly recommend Lonesome Roadbecause of its story and revelations)big iron"

I spoke before of unity And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family That is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheelsmoving in unisonhappy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves Not that these small metal objects are actually animateI'm of course speaking only metaphoricallyI have increased in skillbut I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share Even if that team is less than ideal I have realized that cs is about more than just one's athletic ability Insteadthere is a deeper meaning behind the coltthe AKthe AWPthe deaglethe sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno) And more importantlythe teammates at my side I love them It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatnessI love cs I love to win I love pushing myself to my physical limits It's that feeling that first drove me to the computer For every second that I am not playing csthere is only an unquenchable thirst to play A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outsidesitting at the televisionor playing sports I had an extraordinary time playing this gameand I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel This review may be overthis game may be deadbut I will never stop playing couner-strike (16)I met a lot of people who slept with my mother 10/10old but gold <3yesI was on the fence about this gamebut now I think I can recommend it
1,"It took a year and a half of updatesbut damn it's good now  I have to change my reviewthe game is actually about building and exploration now instead of pond hut simulator  There's actually a good variety of locations now and things to do  Took forever to get the lore right too  It used to be full of just useless notes you'd already read being dropped in the dumbest of ways  Now it's actually got some story to it  I wouldn't say FUNCOM made the perfect gamebut this is probably their best work now  It's no longer an empty game of click and gather  It's got a real building system and the skills aren't broken anymore  I don't change my reviewsbut this right here gets a thumbs up finallyI like Conan ExilesI play all the survival gamesRust7 Days to DieARKI think I like Conan best  No modern weaponscan't get head shot by some wild kid with a killer instinctno real bombscan't get your doors blown off by some wild player with destruction on their minds  I'm 64 years old and I've been a gamer since the early 80s  Work at a prison (sorrystate correctional institution) so Conan is my wind down from a hecticsometimes exasperating dayTo the Devs;dont fuck it up000 playersdont drive people away shitty updatesor useless featurespolish it upsquash the bugsand get it the fuck out of early accessSo me and 2 friends are playing this on a private dedicated PvE server None of us played Ark and the likesbut we are all long time RPG fans Conan Exiles went under our radar for a while as it mostly gets grouped as an ""Ark-like"" TruthÂ isto usit's pretty much the multiplayer survival Skyrim we always dreamed ofdo yourself a favor and play this with your buddies This is not just a sandbox there's much more to itand I'm not a PvP kinda guy But yeah me and my buds are having a blast so farreally Unfortunatelythe Siptah ""expansion"" came out during our playthrough and introduced tons of bugs and adjustments that kinda ruined the end of our journey We had many bosses bug out on usand some gameplay changes were not just hard to get used to but also downright questionable It's been a few months but it seems all recent updates still concentrate on Siptah (which we haven't played) I personally think splitting the map was a bad decisionas the original map is beautifully scuplted in a coherent way and tells a story that cries for expansions Stillall in allif you have buddies to play it withI still recomend it[i]I'll get this out of the way before I even start I am going to compare this game to ARK and Rust While it is its own beast with its own merits and flawsit is within the same genreand many people will wonder how it compares in certain aspects[/i]Conan Exiles has the most potential I've ever seenand it's the first day I am completely baffled by the negative response Compared to ARK at its releasethis game has a much clearer vision and a more complete framework; even if a lot of the contents of that framework are missing or buggy I'm inclined to believe the negative reception is due to the fact that Conan is an existing IPnot a new one People might just expect an IP like this to be completeand not release in Early Access I'm not entirely sure why those people purchased the game in the first place There is definitely a bright blue EARLY ACCESS banner on the Steam store pagethe game does have a lot of issues There's a lot of seemingly random framedropseven to the point of the game completely freezing for several seconds I'm confident this will be worked out with further optimisationbut it is an issue that has somewhat affected my enjoyment of the gameat least initially is superb I can only suspect that it will get better from here[/i]but not ARK simple I said simplenot ugly[/i]but it's obvious there was a lot of care put into the visuals[/i]but it's pretty nice[/i]but a bit more streamlined in my opinion As you level up you gain points to level up attributes like Strength or Encumbrance Furthermore you gain points to purchase crafting recipes But unlike in ARKa lot of the recipes in Exiles will net you two or more items[/i][/list]But Definite Room For Improvement[/u]combat becomes much much better There is a degree of ""Git gud"" going on Howeverblocking responsiveness isn't fantasticand enemy range isn't always what you'd expect it to be[/i]but also better The size of the individual building pieces is rather smallbut despite thisyou don't feel like a giant standing in a hobbit hole if you only build your shelter one wall high Looking at you hereARK[/i][/list]but not so much that it's unplayable[/i]but it is still much better than similar games at their launch[/i]but Co-Opeven with a good connection has lots of desync issues Time of day isn't always going to match up between players I was alsoâ€”as the person not hostingâ€”randomly losing my tools as I tried to equip them At one point we also saw two different items in the same slot of a chest Removing the item and dropping it reverted it to normal[/i]but it's also somewhat problematic for players too Animals will frequently spawn right on top of you Out of the time I've spent playingno less than 3 crocodile-alligators made my ballsack their personal spawnpoint Of courseI could have been in the wrong place at the wrong timebut it seemed a bit too coincidental This exacerbates the issue with low level beds When you're low enough level that you are having trouble with a single crochaving another spawn on you means nearly certain death I haven't unlocked beds yetbut I'm assuming they're more than single useas the low level bedrolls break after one respawn I feel like this is kind of counter productive All it does is encourage resource wasting by building 2+ bedrolls and filling your base with them A much betterbut still similar mechanic would be to damage the bedroll after each respawnand require it to be repaired They could also implement a respawn cooldown That would be vastly superior to how they currently work[/i][/list]and are willing to provide feedbackthere are definitely worse things you could spend $30 on If you're wondering if the game has promise and are just looking to see if it might be worth buying in the future; unless the devs royally eff it upthis game is [b]very[/b] promisingI've liked this game from the start (I started playing during the first month of Early Access) The mood and atmosphere really suited meeven though I have little to none experience with the conan universe Also I generally like open world survival games I came to Conan from countless hours of Ark: Survival Evolvedand although they have many similaritiesthis is an entirely different gameand much of the game mechanics has been revamped several timessuch as combat There has also been some trouble with the developers interraction with the communitybut this have improved a lotit didn't have that much to offer to the survival genre that we hadn't already seen in similar gamesexcept maybe the avatarslarge deity-based creatures that can be summonned at endgame to really wreck havoc on other players Sadlythis was very overpoweredand the game got boring really quick The gameplay (for me at least) was mostly Farming -> Building -> Get raided -> Repeat But as I saidthe mood and atmosphere in this game made it bearable none the less And sometimes I would just exploreand each time I would find something newlike a new NPC campfriendly NPC's that would teach you stuffsome kind of lore (that is scattered around the entire map)caves/dungeonsetcit was mostly just spamming the attack-button on buggy creatures while running aroundor shoot the more powerful creatures from a safe place But this was not a big problem for meI enjoyed the game anyways My biggest issue at that time was how easy it was to exploit the game and the mechanicsand the PvP was very unsatisfying It was more or less required to build your base up high on mountains and suchthen remove all the stairs so you couldnt get raided The whole ordeal was just stupid and sadand the game couldnt be played the way it was meant to bebut I reached max lvl and felt like i had seen the most of what the game had to offermany months laterI am backexcept for a more cinematic introand a bit improved Character Creation But it didnt take long before this felt almost like a new game for me!and they all have their own patterns which is similar to games like Dark Souls Combat now includes things like lock-on and enemy health barwhich is very satisfying for me I haven't tried archery yetwhich was my primary fighting method when I first played this gamebut I hope I will see improvements there as wellwith two new biomes! Also old familiar places have been pimped upand the world seems even more lively now And stillthe game is more performance-friendly then ever!such as traps for raid protectioncounter measures for the avatarstime window for Structure Damageetc The combat is also more dynamic now (you can defeat a player even when you have weaker weapons and lower lvlif you know what you're doing) This opens up for building more freelywhich is a very important aspect for me! Also I feel the community recently has become more friendly (even in Europehaha)which I've always liked in Conan (compared to games like Ark) This have also been greatly modified/improved There are so many things you can craftand for the architects out therethere is few limitations when it comes to structures and building Alsothe new system of which you learn the different crafts is so satisfying (for me at least)even though it took some time to get used towhen you're not building or engaging in PvPthe gameplay revolves heavily around lore and dungeons (this is maybe an even more important aspect in PvE) And there is just so much to explore!and I cant wait for the release!and i was SO looking forward to that! :(A caveat: I play on a private server very casually Just a small group of friendsno pvpjust super casual gatheringbuildingetc But with that saidthe highest praise I can give this game is that my wife loves it and finding a game we can play together makes me happyThis is a pretty good open world sandbox not going to lieI've played this mostly on private servers with friends Almost exlusively Played a lot of Rust and stuff like that andya knowyou get tired of hours of work being destroyed for the lolz by a group of a**holes slightly more numerous than you You could join themand troll othersand wreck their stuff but it gets old But that's how PvP in these gamse go As a group/solo experienceit's fun to bonk people on the head and drag them back to process them into happy citizens of your towna looooong time agoyou couldn't jump in FPS games Golden Eye Perfect Dark Couldn't jump Go back and play them It's weirdor a small rock and you're likestuckand you're like""Bruh really?""mate Die doing it But you died doing what you loved And most of allYou Died FREE[h1] Corporate greed strikes yet again[/h1]there is no privacy policy associated with this 3rd party account system The game offers no information what data is collected or stored which is illegal under EU GDPR regulations If you have bought the game prior to 16062020 updateI would recommend to STOP playing the game and seek for an immediately refund if you wish sogot rid of Steamworks APIsmost things will now go through their 3rd party services People are unable to join serverssome cant even use the game due to no more possible offline playuntil developers clearly indicate what is this new funcom's 3rd party account servicewhere is it based and what data is being shared/collectedavoid buying the game even under saleunless the game is actually freethe only sh1t they care about now is how to get money By people buying the game and then profiting of our dataI have only played 45 hours here on steam But that does not mean thatI don't know anything about this game or that I have not played more of it I have played it but not on steam for a good 100 or so hoursFirst offthis is an amazing game Maybe the best hardcore pvp survival game out there Sure it's a buggy mess at timesbut the lore is suprisingly cool and pvp barrier of entry is much better than Ark  The building is better than Arkthe items and weapons in the game are better than ark (there are a ton of weapons)the bosses and dungeons are numerous and better much than Ark it's a lot of fun and massively underappreciatedRUIN SYSTEM is what he's known as currently He looted our vault that's 100 ft up in the air just by looking at it It wasn't even during raid hours He ran like the speed of a horse and killed me on my mount He was clipping through walls and was killing us even though he's level 20 and we're three level 60's and pretty well gearedwe witnessed him raid another vault without breaking it as well and put on the best gear in the game and proceeded to run around killing people When called him out (because he was terrible at pvp honestly) he crashed the server for over an hour and duped his stats so he had maxed out everythingwhich is something they dobut this is a massive issue in this game and all of the veteran players are leaving It's not like Call of Duty where you just get more killsthe items in this game can sometimes take hundreds of hours to accumulate to the degree that people doand someone just comes in and takes itundermeshes a base where no-one can raid itand Funcom doesn't seem to be doing all that much about itor crack down hard on hackers This game will die if they do notI don't like survival games Something about them just never really grabbed me or clicked with meI am losing sleep! Should probably throw out a warning out there peoplethat this is addictive once you get into itlike I saidits a survival gameI missed that What matters is how the game is nowpurges (raids)and Legendary Creatures that well better come prepared with some friends I thought it would get in the way of the funbut it adds so much I am glad it is thereto meads and ale to get you drunk and add buffs or to warm you up for cold conditions so you don't dieto cookingto alchemical bases for making potions or stronger steelto weaponsarmouretc It feels endless at times with the amount of options you have Very satisfying each time to progress to the next recepe and to unlock new things either through learning or exploration You can even have thralls (boink enemies over the head and bend their will to do you bidding) and pets nowintuitive and so much fun You can build almost anywhere and almost anything Not gonna say more about this oneother than its a time-siphon that I am enjoying so muchcrafting and building?

There is a chance they will add magicbut I kinda hope they don't We can summon huge avatars in the image of gods of worship to rek shop as well Its enough imosingle purchaseand its yours The content you can buy is just cosmetic really With completely new building skinsplus armour and weapon ""skins"" that don't power creep into the game and ruin balance And with this system at hand there is potential for them to add so many more variations in the futurePvPPvE with PvP windows on certain hours/daysfull PvEor go offline and play it solo or co-op with friends on private games were mind youall options are yours to controlalong with even admin privelleges (just press ""make admin"" and you're done) for a lot of wacky ways to testbreakor simply enjoy the gamesurvivalbuildingcombatexploration or roleplayingand you are gold to go with plenty hours to wasteits not the best stability I haven't tried PvP for this very reasonand do not intend to I don't think I can enjoy a game with frequent 100 ping climbs This is rather noticeable on a real time combat game like this where timing really is key between living or dying And being able to play offline rubbs it in your face when you see how fluid and awesome the game can bealthough less than a third of the time its going bannanasits still a little too much I think and throws your confidence off for things like PvP There are private servers too ofcourseso this experience can varybut nothing too game breaking so far Surethey do become annoying when they happen Other times they are just hilarious (like AI bugs) This is another area that needs more polishsome RP polish and server stability/netcode polishthe game is a blast I completely recommend it Do I need to say more?so this game is getting more hate than I think it deserves""this game has a lot of potential""and people not picking the right server for them it will kill the game and never have the chance to live up to its potential that everyone wants to seethat will depend on what server you select Its the nature of the survival genre to have a ""toxic"" community and favor those who play more This game has a very nice feature that goes unnoticed by too many players that can fix that issue There are server types it brings up when you search for a game (pvppvepve-rppvp-rpblah blah blahnot going to list all the combonations) The beauty of that is there ARE SOME SERVERS that are heavily moderated and have rules and regulations such as not being allowed to raid people when they are offlineor not being able to just kill players with no purpose in mind or whatever your prefrences are pick the right server for you and the game will pay off far better for you in the long runin fact i've come to like it better than any other survival-crafting game out there I suggest playing it and forming your own opinionI love roleplaying in this game helps me forget about my cancer :)As I push 200 hours I feel it is time to give a competent review of ""Conan Exiles"" in its current stateand from my perspective given the style and game mode we (my wife and I) are currently playing Just a notewe are diehard Conan fansand the given genre is right in our sweet spot having been avid ""AD&D"" and ""Everquest"" players back in the daytaking far greater interest in games such as ""The Forest"" and ""Empyrion"" than games such as ""Ark"" which I played someand games like ""Rust""""Life is Feudal""""Day Z""""7 D2D""which I sampled but never really got into I also greatly enjoy many of the single player survival games some of which are VR capable such as ""Subnautica"" While I consider myself equally PVE and PVP centric as a playerplaying ARK PVP was nothing short of a relentless and unproductive experience and despite some tenacious efforts to enjoy it on my partwas never fun to play However â€œARKâ€ in VR is nothing short of one of the greatest treats I have ever encountered as a lifelong gamer of many yearsand beta testing ""Shroud of the Avatar""""Gloria Victis""""Savage Lands"" etc We have also basically played just about every MMO on the market including ""Conan"" for many years I would say we have extremely discerning taste when it comes to gaming and will happily take a quality game like ""Mount and Blade"" whose lack of graphics are easily made up for with content and replay abilitythe experience was tantamount to that which we had in ""ARK"" in that when you aren't fighting relentless server issuesyou are contending with a completely unbalancedoften toxic population of people hell bent on making your in game experience anything but productive or pleasurable by utilizing the plethora of bugsglitches and exploits which currently riddle the PVP portion of the game I am confident that in timegiven the tenacity of the devs and their constant efforts to patch and improve the gamethat these issues will become manageable and we will revisit that element of the game in the future In the meantime the two of us are just playing PVE together on a private serverand truth be toldwe are absolutely loving the game In factfrom this perspectivethere is little to nothingsave some minor bugs here and there that we even dislike about the gamealbeit even simpler to learn and progress than in either of those games We have only slightly deviated from the default settings and are taking our time progressing through the content We are both around level 30 and have tried to balance our time between buildingleveling and exploringall of which are extremely rewarding in their own wayboth of which are powerful machinesand by comparison is in some ways more straight forward and rewardingas well as recipes and uses for that which you obtain from harvesting them If anythingthe fauna can be a bit overwhelming in the earlier stages of the game and act as kind of a meter suggesting by one's success or failure if it is time to move onor to stay put and improve gear and attributes a bit moresurvival or tower defense genres We dabble with the ""Dark Souls"" seriesbut ""Conan Exiles"" truly satisfied just about every aspect of our gaming needs Most importantlywe are having fun playing in a way so many games simply fail to deliverbut currently we are enjoying the aspect of the game we are playing and the experience is nothing short of a 10/10 for uswith smaller clan size limits of perhaps five people per clan Obviously the more like minded the players are on the serverthe more enjoyable the experience will be for everyone Alasnot everyone has ten or twenty friends they can get to play the same gamebut this is one game which would truly shine above most given such a scenario We definitely look forward to the server issues being improvedand we remain encouraged by the obvious care and time the devs are continuously putting into the game's development Until then we will continue to enjoy this great experience and look forward for more to come as the game progressesIt was good back in the day I bought this game solely to play Singleplayer offline Now I can'twhen I'm traveling with a laptopor somewhere where I don't have a connection at allstart the gamechoose Singleplayeryou get the message that it can't connect to Funcom Live Services That's ityou can't playI won't be able to play at all I've had enough of thisbut it's locked behind Online DRM False advertisingAfter being purchased by TENCENT you now need a connection to the funcom servers even for single playerApparently difficult to format this anymore One way to make sure truth stays obscured!the company running it just cant figure out that if they are going to update - and ALL games NEED updating How to do it in a way that doesn't crush the spirits of the player base!I admit I am enjoying the game - precisely because I play on a Server with several Gigs of Community patches (I mean MODS) on itunless the got it for free or nearly soHonestly it can be a lotta fun and the graphics are good and the mechanics are fair as well but I do not recommend this due to the massive incompetence of the developer I can only see it sliding into oblivion and would save some poor soul from spending their cash on something in a tailspinIts too late for me but save yourselves!Official game servers are down and crashing And they TESTED this for upwards of a Month and didn't spot ANY of these totally game breaking issues?Back when this hit early accessI was hesitant Told my friends I'd wait for it to release Got it on Humble a while back and finally installed itDarkout to SubnauticaI've played a lot of themI'm playing on a private server with friends but that's how I always play these gamesif a little odd sometimes Having the optionthoughis awesomeit's one of my top 5<---------------- EDIT ---------------->AFTER being limb shit for years about the cheatersNOW they are banning PVE players and destroying their structures without so much as a noticeor even chance to correct it if FUNCOM decides it is against its vague rule bookwho is no expert on how game servers functionthat in attempts to save their gameFuncom has doomed it by turning against their own players And hell bethey cannot weather few puny cheatersso to feel in command they ban and demolish players with years of history in a single serverjust because some asswho joined talks smack on their forumsas you can tell I have over 4 000 hours in this gamemost of them I've spent on Official PVP servers I've started to play the game when it was still in [b]early access[/b]seen it's developments throughout the years With the most recent massive update [b]Isle of Siptah[/b]our clan returned to the game with full forcewe enjoyed it very much and hoping that all the bad things that are possible in this game wouldn't follow us there How wrong were weafter a week server started crashingand global chat went wild about cheatersand cheaters we found indeedthey were meshing and using speedhack (while going in to the meshes and destroying the cheaters is simple enoughcountering the third-party hacking software is on it's own league)but some of the things that have been broken over the years are hatches and elevatorsvarious weaponsand now the whole cooking systembut there are things that have been going on for yearsthere is no server or a period of time when I have not encountered cheaters in this game or any of the servers I'v played on Now I knowthat Funcom is trying to fix these issues by implementing new measuresbut all in all I think that is wrongthe answer is more severe punishment[b]permanent bans[/b]came the cheatersthe official PVP server (#6002) was full almost daily before the first clan that left due to cheatersand after our encounter with themour interests waned as wellspend countless hours on itand my money It irritates me that I cannot enjoy my money and time invested the way the developers intended because of cheaterand it irritates me that they don't permanently ban these peoplethey shouldnot with all the cheating going on on the serversand not taking good care of ustheir customers and source of incomeI really like this gamebut the 100gb mandatory updates make me want to PULL MY HAIR OUT I live in a very rural areaand my internet peeks at 12mbsso it's a good 15hrs of downloading We rely on the internet for our phone and TVso I constantly have to pause the update -- especially when my wife complains Last update took 5 daysand now I'm having to do it all over again Why does Funcom make you download the entire game every time they patch? It's extremely frustrating Give me an offlinepatch optional versionplease""you're rating your internetnot the game"" -- you've completely missed the point There is this concept called 'usability'; When you purchase a productand can't control when you are able to use itthat's an issue For 15 years I was a SSE for a big manufacturing firmso I understand the convenience of code modularization Funcom does not"
1,"So there I wasbuilding my factory with a nice day/night cycle after a while I noticed that it had been perpetually night for a really long time I chalked it up to a bug and continued building my bowl of spaghettion the far side of the planetbeing eclipsedI'll keep it simpleconsidering the amount of time you'll be enjoying themI have over 300 hours in this gameoften playing it all day long It's never crashed It's never glitched out or corrupted my save game I'm at the point where I've completed a Dyson Sphere and it's never dropped a frame despite multiple planets literally covered in production lines Dyson Sphere Program  looks absolutely beautifulI could describe Dyson Sphere Program as ""Factorio in 3D""but that wouldn't come close; perhaps ""Satisfactory on more than one planet and with an actual end game goal"" would be a better fit There's soso much morebut that's a good starting point I hate it when someone seems like they're raving about a gamebut that's what I'm about to do There's a summary at the endif long-winded prattle isn't your style Saddle uphere we goI have 46 hours played and I only bought it 72 hours ago I played it for 15 hours in my very first sessionand only stopped because my wife insisted I get some sleep I'll admit that I left it running while I slept for about 9 hoursbut in my defense I was trying to break the game by flying to another star system (remember No Man's Sky?)but have never launched a rocket; I have over 1000 hours in Fallout 4two weeks of which was spent breaking the economy in survival mode with the workshop DLC by smashing tens of thousands of lunchboxes [spoiler] Nuka-Cola is too heavy to be good for commercebut if you drink it you get a bottle cap Pens and pencilson the other handare weightless even in survival mode [/spoiler]I unlocked my screen to find myself close enough to the system I aimed for to check out the planets in itand spent quite a while gleefully doing exactly that (and taking notes) I went on to visit several star systemsalthough none was nearly so long in journey time as the first trip I did some IRL things while I coasted through space at a ""mere"" 1000m/s for an hour or two on my way to neighboring star systems that were ""only"" a few light years away As far as I can tellthe sole penalty for not using warp drive is that it takes [b]much[/b] longer to get where you're going; I regret being too impatient to research just a bit more before I left my home systemjust like in reality The letters (roughly) follow the alphabet in scale As an exampleSol (our sunaka the star in our own [i]solar[/i] system) is a G type staras is the star you start on in any new game F type stars are slightly hotterK are slightly cooler relatively speakingand there tend to be more of them They also tend to have large chunks of ""basic"" resources on them F type stars seem to be likely to have a relatively good selection of basic resourcesand to also be relatively comfortableif [i]slightly[/i] less densely populated by planets than G type stars' systems K and M stars seem to have more rare mineralsbut the very few planets are let's just say""less hospitable"" Lava or ice were prevalent features on manyif not most that I visited during my journey B-type stars have amazing amounts of resources on a fair-to-middling number of planetsbut those planets tend to also be slightly less pleasant than would be ideal; ""Warm and dry"" would be a good descriptoralthough less hostile in general than the ""fire and ice"" I found at the K/M end of the scale [u]The only water oceans I found were in orbit around F or G stars[/u]but did not visitboth a neutron star and a black hole as well as several red giants and white dwarf stars I'm looking forward to visiting thosebut did not feel like 30+ real-world hours of travel time could possibly result in a payoff that would be worth it I may come back and update after I achieve warp travelbut don't hold your breath [/spoiler]leaning toward F type rather than K type if you have the option Skip M type and B type until you've got a solid logistics system and/or can bring a ""base in a bucket"" with you [u]Don't forget to bring fuel for the return journey[/u] unless your plan to get home is ""load a save file""and research warp drive before heading for another star; It makes the journey *much* fastersound effects are stellarand positional audio is *so* immersive (thank youdevs) The graphics are top-notch for an Early Access title It's obvious that a lot of time and effort went into the art assetsand I don't actually feel like anything is missingat least in what I've experienced so far OhI did encounter an unimplemented technology in the research treebut it's labeled ""Work in progress""it's not selectableand skipping it doesn't prevent other techs from being researchedso the actual impact on gameplay is practically non-existentand the grammar is kinda gnarly in placesbut I would imagine that will be polished to perfection when they get around to it and it still manages to [i]mostly[/i] get the point acrossalthough I did have to read a few phrases more than once to understand the intended meaning To be fairI've seen worse spelling and grammar in titles that only had English as a language optionso this is perhaps another point to be impressed byrather than an actual issueabout 60% complete?) then I can't wait to see what it looks like once it's actually finished Well worth the money I paid for it in its present stateand knowing what I know nowI would easily have paid twice as much Buy it before the price goes up; this one is phenomenalStep 1: Make spaghetti factoryso you decide to make a bunch of planetary logistics systems and mass produce logistics drones in an attempt to literally cover the entire planet in an apocalyptic cloud of resource-trafficking robotsWARNING: This game will eat your time There were so many moments i wanted to exit then the sun rose and i saw what i had madethen played for at least 2 or 3 more hours I have some quality of life issues but jesus this game is too good to dwell on those Buy this is you like factorio and satisfactory but make sure you have a clear scheduleI'm still trying out but this game seems fun Those who said that this game chews away time is obviously untrueand I certainly recommend it! Jokes asideit does suck away a huge amount of time per session Handle with care""I started playing at 6pmand before I knew itit was 7pm What a productive 25 hours""Oh lordlet me just start out by saying that as soon as I got this game I played for 6 days straight until it was finishedâ€¦ for an average of 12 hours a day I abandoned responsibilitiesslept like 4 hours a nightand my room is a mess at the momentbut it was a fun rideand realized that career path was too much work so I got in to a programming careerand this game hits both of those aspects of me in just the right way Progression is fun and rewarding The game gives you very little in the way of explanations of things Thereâ€™s an advisor like in Stellaris that gives you tips on how to play the gameeven a very minimal tidbit of lore about who you arethe state of humanity and what youâ€™re doing Itâ€™s interestingâ€¦ itâ€™s just all in very poorly translated engrish It sounds like they hired a fluent English speaker to voice the advisorbut it also sounds like they paid him to read a script straight from google translate and he just said â€˜hey so long as you pay meIâ€™ll say whatever you wantâ€™so now youâ€™ve just got this fluently english dude reading a half-unintelligible line and while many would see this as a detrimentI found it very amusing and endearing The funny thing isyou really donâ€™t even need more than the half-unintelligible tips to figure out how the game works The game has a very low learning curveand is very intuitive They made a system thatâ€™s really fun to just mess with until you start to get a feel for how it worksand you continually expand and compound on what you learn The upgrade tree is very simpleyet engaging as well I like that the later tiers even have infinitely repeatable upgradesso if you just want to keep going after the end gameyou could just become ridiculously decked outand itâ€™s already fleshed out enough to give me 70 hours of sheer enjoymentwell worth the price It still needs a bit of polishbut really already has a level of content that exceeds many comparable fully released games Theyâ€™re very actively updating it and have added very many quality of life features just in the short few sleep-deprived days I've played it It still has its flaws For instanceinformation matrices (one of the core items you have to produce to win the game) was the bane of my existence There are 5 main â€˜matricesâ€™ you progressively create manufacturing lines for (plus a 6th final matrix made from the previous 5 combined)and these are then used for researching new technologies and personal upgrades Information matrices are the 4th tier of those 5and feels like it requires half the silicon in the known universe to make as many as you needafter all Itâ€™s a shame really I went to a black hole for shiggles onceand the way they rendered it was absolutely gorgeousI just had no reason to go there This game really is just beautifulâ€¦ sometimes I would just sit in awe amongst the array of lights from my many conveyor belts watching the sunset as it was surrounded by a ring of dyson sphere nodes and the glimmering ring of the dyson swarm surrounding that Hats off to the modeling teamthey really outdid themselves with the beautiful and scientific aesthetic of it all And hats off to the coding team! I was really struck by how you could justâ€¦ fly into the air and you were in spaceseamlessly The entire universe was at your fingertips to fly to at any time with zero loading screens Itâ€™s not just an open worlditâ€™s an open universe and every logistically complex mining/manufacturing plant you create on every planet keeps going even when youâ€™re not there without overly bogging down your computer Color me impresseddonâ€™t be too hyped for getting a bigcrazy ending I won't spoil anythingbut itâ€™s very brief (though there is some lore!)and itâ€™s really only there to mark an end pointto tell you youâ€™ve done just about all there is to do The beauty of this game is truly in the journeyand you can continue playing even after youâ€™ve finished everythingI very highly recommend this gamebut only if you can spare a good 70+ hours becoming utterly addicted to it I canâ€™t recall a game I was as compelled to binge as this one in years For fellow technically minded sci fi nerds like methis game is absolutely worth itand then quadruple that infrastructure Silicon is going to be your most used resource by far late gamemostly for those dang information matriceseven once theyâ€™ve reached max efficiencyhave a â€˜capâ€™ of how much power they can drawor how many critical photons they can produce Once the power your dyson sphere generates exceed the cap the ray receiver can drawonly then do you need to make another one I didnâ€™t realize this til super late gameand thought I only needed one ray receiver and was like â€˜wowmy dyson sphere does jack diddly for power demandsâ€™ Also! Put ray receivers at the poles Light hits your poles all dayand so they never lose efficiencyor shells and such I didnâ€™t realize this until late game too and was like â€˜oooohhhhthat wouldâ€™ve been helpful to know a lot soonerâ€™There's plenty of reviews on here comparing this game to Factorioand saying it's a great game that's just like it This is 100% truebut instead of just adding the same stuff onto the pileI figure I'd address some of the things I've seen in the negative reviewseven though in reality you're placing buildings with a ""rectangle"" footprint on a sphere(planet) and the fact that it's 3d instead of Factorio's 2D I haven't had an issue placing blocks or buildings at all The only thing I would ask for is for blueprinting to be addedbut that's not something I would expect day 1 of early access(Factorio didn't even have it day 1it was added after about a year)but nothing is hard to understand Here is an excerpt from one of the paragraphs in the game: ""The Photon Combiner can convert low-frequency photons into high-frequencyeffectively reducing solar energy loss from solar radiation"" Seems like a pretty coherent sentenceespecially when that is something I imagine would be a little difficult to translate It makes me wonder if people chose Chinese when it asks what language at the start of the game and are now complaining they can't understand anythingexcept for manually crafting larger number of items I would suggest maybe instead of the +/- by the produce buttonmaybe just a normal click makes 1shift click makes 10and ctrl click makes 100? But the technology tree is easy to use(even allowing for queuing of technology)the map is easy to usebasically everything except the manual production bitsince I do have a nice PC(10th gen i7GTX 2070)but I haven't had an issue The game is capped at 60 FPS defaultand in the settings to bump it to a max of 100 I can run it just fine at 100but I leave it at 60 since that's good enough for me when it comes to a factory building game But maybe there are some issues on lower end hardwareI would hope as development progresses those issues get ironed outthis should be in the game As of launch it's notbut I know it's on the roadmap and they seem to think of it as a high priority But I agree with this oneI would love to change key bindingsbuilding big factories on planets is fun stuff I haven't gotten to jumping around from planet to planet or system to systembut looking forward to it I'd give the game in it's current state a 75-8/10 so farmain drawback is those keybindings :P Once those are added I'd go to a 85-9(maybe higher depending on how fun the late game is)and more development could raise my opinion of it even more Great fun for anyone who is into this type of gameAbsolutely overwhelmingly yesfactorio and a plethora of other such games where smart engineering is at the forefront of the gameplay itselfthis is practically a stealand for an early access title is one of the most polished and enjoyable releases i've seen in quite a whiletop seller in steam's chartswith a 96% approval ratingyou cannot go wrong giving this a tryDSP is a game about putting things into boxes so you can build things to put in boxes so you can build boxes so big you can put stars into the boxes Boxesby the wayintrinsic logicelegance on a level I've never seen in a video game before Also the graphics are nice There is nothing quite like standing at the north pole of your zen garden planet staring at your ten layer deep matryoshka sphere that you designed to look like you've created an origami swan with tesseracts folded through a variable-dimensional n>5 space and thinking to yourself about what the next one will requireBLUF: My first save of the game was titled""What time is it?""No Man's Skyetc I was interested in factory games like Factoriobut the 2D perspective and overwhelming complexity was a bit of a turn off DSP looked like a bit more accessible version of factory genre plus a nice dose of space explorationso I took the plungethings feel really big when they are bigbut not so much so that it takes eternity to get anywhereto your solar systemthen the entire star clusterunlocking buildings and items as you go Finding rare resources and exotic stars and planets is really coolespecially when they are useful in your interstellar factoryMUCH LESS an EARLY ACCESS title A few placement issues with buildings and beltsbut very minor One crash in over 135 hrs of playyou don't actually have to build a permanent Dyson Sphere structure to ""beat the game""only do a specific research that requires resources gathered from a star Since there a couple different ways to get this resourceyou don't actually have to finish a structure to beat the game A slightly odd choicebut I suspect is was done this way because it can take a REALLY long time to finish a sphere (see more details below) and giving the ""mission accomplished"" before the long grind sets in is probably a good thingit's a bit surprising that there is no way to automate the rapid construction of buildings and the sorters required to interact with those buildings This becomes more and more of a problem in the middle to late game when you are making dozens of the same structures over and over again Mods like ""Copy Inserters"" and ""Multibuild"" are an absolute requirement to save you from clicking yourself to death - and this is coming from someone who generally tries to avoid using modsof the 135 + hrs I've spent on one play throughalmost half have been after ""mission accomplishment"" just waiting on my sphere to finish building Yesyou can make your factory bigger to speed things upbut scaling up your dyson sphere component production takes a LOT of repetitive factory building and a bit of resource whack-a-mole There is nothing that is challenging from a problem-solving perspectivejust a matter of how much repetition can you put up with It would be really nice to see some higher level automation available Like some AI that you can command to ""go setup xx metal extraction at xx planet and bring it here""or something like thatbut definitely worth checking out in it's current stateFactorio + Satisfactory + Planetary annihilation all you gotta knowDecades agoplaying video gamesI saw generation after generation improve on what could be done XCOM with maps that you could climband damage;

The fun is in figuring that out  Every so oftenas you research and craft more componentsa new building will be unlocked and you won't always know what it does until you try it  You will be forever battling energy and resource limitationsbut that is the point of the game - creating a sustainable and stable energy source  The game never feels difficult to understandbut there is no hand-holding either  So you made that thing - now figure out what you can do with itI suddenly realised that the research tree is a bit misleading (probably because other games of this genre pace their resource tree to span to the end of the game)  But in Dysonresearch is just a fraction of the game  I've unlocked nearly everything and have yet to make any significant in-road to building my Dyson Sphere  I realise that I'm nowhere near the end goal yet  I have so much more to do  Right nowin FactorioI would be well on the way to building my rocket and escaping the planet  In Dysonyou are aiming for much more than a rocket  It is muchmuch bigger  I expect I will be playing my current playthrough for a long time to come as yetI say no  I have read criticisms about the space flight but I disagree  I think the flight model is more realisticbeing sucked into gravity fields of gas giantsovershooting a planet creating difficulties in swinging back for a return sweep  Another criticism I've read is that the planets are so smallbut I think that's necessary to make resource management critical and can absolutely see why that design choice was made  I've read criticisms about balancing issuesand there is a degree of that (especially with chemical-plant related construction) but that is an issue that is more a staple of this entire genre and not just specific to Dyson Sphere Program  I think the only criticisms that the developers do need to look at is firstly handling properly a lack of inventory slot when manufacturing something - especially something 'expensive' like a logistics station because all those valuable resources are lost if no space is availableand also making the end goal essential  Right nowit's not  I don't want to say too much because spoilersbut that does need addressing  Howevertaking into consideration that this title is still Early Accessthe absence of more major flaws is impressive!this game's rating stands at 97% overwhelmingly positive - and that's with good reason!  The fact it's still in early access is a credit to its highly-active and public-focused developers as the game runs flawlessly  My only technical issue is that it does turn my gaming laptop into a hot toaster pretty quickly(!) but that asideI've run into no problemsbugs or crashes at alland the bar has been set very high for the factory building/production line genre of games  While it is clearly inspired by all the best of Factorio's offeringsit also takes the game in a sufficiently different direction so that it doesn't act as a replacement or a blatant copy  I cannot recommend this game enough and it thoroughly deserves it's overwhelmingly positive ratingThis game is absolutely addicting I kept thinking I would be able to put it down after hitting the next milestoneso far that hasn't happened I made some early mistakes with my first buildso bad that I restarted from scratch after about the first 6 hours After thatit was no looking back I obsessed over routing resources from place to placemoving and re-moving different conveyor belts and optimizing paths and output cadences Once the aerial logistics comes inthat's when this game shines Seemingly overnight I went from plodding along to covering an ENTIRE PLANET with stuff Once the planet was fullI ended up using some of the other planets in the system that were otherwise totally uninteresting and useless - random volcanic worlds with scorching hot surface? No problem! Build stuff all over itthat would be totally annoying Insteadthis little robot - I know it says ""Icarus"" I call it ""Skippy"" - manages to keep an absurd abundance of hardware stored in higher dimensionsI have entire logistics systems devoted to logistics systems and basically at this point have a dozen planets pumping out components to build dyson spheres in a dozen other systemsgreat to immerse yourself in or have on in the background while you're working on other stuffalmost forgotit's BEAUTIFUL Taking your Skippy up close to a black hole's event horizon and coming back Checking out a stonetree planetwindswept plains of a desolate wastelandtropical paradisea funky Alpha-Centauri-looking planet - it's all just gorgeousDo not buy this Game  at this point I have been playing this Game for 150 hours and the game is not out that longI started the game uptook a drink of waterand suddenly 84 hours have gone byIt's Factorio simplified & repackaged with a space themevisually very pleasing and no performance issuesbut it's easy to find flaws and leave feeling underwhelmed"
1,"It would honestly be fair to call 2K an evil company at this point There are only two options; either the company is staffed solely by incompetent developers who are incapable of creating a functioning game ORmuch more likelythey knowinglyannuallydecide to tighten the screws of their monopoly around the heads of literally millions of kids who shell out billions of dollars in revenue to this company every yearabysmal AIor the horrific optimization that is sure to make even a beginer-level programmer cry himself to sleep Ihoweverthink it is much more interesting to talk about the scam itself: to purposefully make the game unbearable throughout every facet of its gameplay The sheer malignance of such behavor is difficult to understand for normal peoplebut here it is important to understand how financial incentives choke the life out of every argument for game improvements that is not bounded in optimizing the ""revenue stream""as far as I am aware Making the game unplayable is actually profitable If you drip-feed as little fun and engagement to your players as humanly possible and hide even this behind as many paywalls as possibleyou create the illusion that ""once you pay just a *bit* more the game will get fun"" but it just never does It's economics for elementary schoolersand it works magic It's a freemium game that you pay 60 euros for every year A cash cow only rivaled by the Madden/FIFA franchiseswho succumb to a love of basketball every yearand every year walk away disappointed The worst thing is that I'll probably keep playing I'll suffer through 10-15% of every mycareer game consisting of advertisements and skippable-after-a-while cutscenes I'll suffer through trying again and again for literally hours to get games in the rec centeronly for my teammates to lag out for the 10th timeor for the entire opposing team to consist of 110-everything-with-every-badge-in-the-game hackers I'll get booted/dc'd/lagged out in a hundred different wayswhile walking a tightrope trying to avoid the myriad of game-breaking bugs and glitches that the game """"""features""""""so allow me to do it digitally plsall I can think about is how they can possibly be so disrespectful The solutions are not difficultthey are not even expensive or technically demandingand yet they will never be implemented It pays so much more dividends to invest in ""2KTV"" or the new look of the neighborhood It's a slap in the face of every playerevery day of every week of every month of every yearand my unbridled disgustå…¶ä»–é—®ä¸åšè¡¨è¿°ï¼Œæ¯•ç«Ÿä¸€ä¸ªäººæœ‰ä¸€ä¸ªäººçš„å–œå¥½ã€‚åªè¯´ä¸€ç‚¹ï¼ŒPCå¹³å°å…¬å›­90%çš„å¤–æŒ‚ï¼Œéš¾é“å°±æ²¡ä¸€ç‚¹åŠžæ³•ï¼Ÿå…¬å›­å¼€æŒ‚ï¼Œæ”¹ä½“åž‹ä¸å°å·ï¼Œåˆ·å¾½ç« åˆ·VCç«‹é©¬å°å·ã€‚åˆç€ä½ çš„åˆ©ç›Šä¸å®¹ä¾µçŠ¯ï¼ŒçŽ©å®¶çš„åˆ©ç›Šè‚†æ„è·µè¸ï¼ŸThere is very little difference from 2k20 The only difference is the shot meter All icon are the samecut scenesits quite astounding how little has changed Feels exactly the same There're not even trying anymorewhat a jokesame bugs also Have to be in window mode for Sim to work Like fix something at least!

Why are we shelling out $60 dollars for nearly the same product as last year?  Simple answer: Because they can! The endIn-game ad for a full price game?? Seriously??Wait it's all the same?This game is objectively the same game as 2K20not only branded as a new game at a $60+*** price tag but it also disgraces Kobe Bryant's memoryand all of these changes could've been implemented in a tiny game update (for MyCareer):only to find out that you need to spend another $50-$100 to actually have a character with any semblance of NBA talent/skill (or optionally you can suffer through ~50-100 games of absolutely awful and boring gameplay with a 40 overall player)too goodawkward animations in general make the game play like Madden (and that is not a good thing)which has a massive weight in the overall systemthus boosting your overall to make it appear your player can runjumpdribble a basketballand etc (which they can't do until your player is heavily upgraded)but they couldn't hire anyone to port the next-gen game to PC? They didn't tell us PC wouldn't be getting the next-gen update until the new consoles launched If you don't knownext-gen 2K21 actually has a lot of improvements and is a substantively different (and better) game than 2K20 and 2K20 20 This game is a $60 roster update marketed off the tragic death of a basketball legend Don't buy this garbage Stick with 2K20 if you already have it If it's cheaper than 21of course buy it insteadnot made for the pcdevelopers just don't careCopy and paste gameplayawfulcheating AIlazy developers Embarrassing effort I remember back when 2K was really goodbut that's goneI actually spent money on this gamejust to have all my files corrupted (Which is totally my faultknowing 2K is a scam company) This company literally does zero work to improve any aspect of the game and used the death of Kobe Bryant as a marketing ployI was suprised I had to download 85 GBthey could have just taken 84 GB from the already installed 2k20Paid 59â‚¬ for a patchNEXT GEN ON PC PLEASEHonestlyI am a big 2k fan As much as I want to make this a positive reviewI just can't Game feels too empty Especially in MyCareer which I play the mostI haven't encountered any singe cutscene Super disappointingpre-game showsdugout cams Everything seems to be emptySowhere to begin  Iflike meyou love basketballmaybe you once collected cardsand you enjoy games with ""management"" elementsthis game has elements that touch all of those interestsyou should stay farfar away  This is one of those playing-it-for-100-hours-before-you-ask-am-I-really-having-fun-and-uninstalling kind of games  It's incredibly frustrating becauseit could be so goodmultiple game modesa steady supply of new challengesthere's a mycareer modeetcauction houses exploitative; this is no different  It's a trick to make you feel likeif you ""sell"" your 15th duplicate cardyou didn't *totally* just waste your actual moneyfranklythey need to create a practice mode that simulates the 300 ms delay you often feel when you press the shoot button so you can practice compensating  (many gamers eventually turn off the shot meter and just use visual cues because it's so lagged out and deceptive)  I've played games that have guns shooting bullets (you knowsomething whose speed and responsiveness should be much harder to simulate) that do waywayway better than this basketball game  Battlefield 4 had less rubber bandingat firstfun  Eventuallyyou realize that they keep trying to force you to play in ""unnatural"" ways to earn rewardssomething that I first experienced with the Battlefield assignment system and eventually contributed to me quitting that series (after 3 games)  Let me explore the game my way!

It's quite disheartening to grind for a player/cardcome to enjoy it (for a short while)and then realize three weeks later that you can't use that awesomefun player card anymore without getting embarrassed by a lower skilled player with players from new OP packsdo MyTeam Co-Op and Co-Op matchmaking (against the AI)  Co-op is out of fashionand yesyou could play in the ""Playground"" to do some co-op stuffbut wouldn't team/deck building for a Co-Op in MyTeam against the AI bejustfun????  Short game modes and scenarios onlyfor surebut come on!  Do it! (I say do itbut I'm pretty sure I'm never playing another 2K sports title; let others enjoy)have players live pick their cards in alternating fashion1 by 1certainly for Triple Threat  Yesit'd add like 90 seconds to a match but it'd also build more actual strategy into the team selection rather than dumb luck  It also might more elegantly allow peoplelike meto quit if I'm not wanting to do my 8th straight match against Galaxy Opal Giannisafter an online matchgive a small VC bonus to the opposing player if they wereyou knownice and/or a good challenge  Having some positive incentives might actually curb some of the toxic behavior (FYI: the PC online community is decent/mediocre  This opinion is influenced mostly by my console experience on Playstationwhich is a cesspool  And yesI own the game twice because I'm an idiot)  I've actuallyoccasionally played against someone I had fun playing againsteven when I lostand it'd be great to actually support those folks  Honestlythe metrics of this sort of feedback system should also be incorporated into matchmaking to groupummore ""compatible"" player typesno jokeinvisible players in some games against the AI  Optimize your graphics  Using the most standard/best camera anglevery subtly labeled 2Kis the camera angle that will shank your graphics card and create frame pacing issues every time the transparency of the backboard comes into view  Fix the issues created by a framerate over 60 (just don't go over 60especially in MyCareer while simulating time when you're on the bench Just don't)  Fix the fact that the g-damn player cardsTHE PLAYER CARDSare the thing that will drive your graphics card (and Playstation) into hysteresis  Your system will start to taxi the runway every time you decide to check out your ""Heat Check"" playersI promisebut it absolutely does not love them back  Don't believe me?  Check out an NBA 2k21 focused youtube channel  Check out the content near the end of a ""season""  They/we are exhausted andhonestlymiserable  The high of getting the card will show upforlike3 minutes of the video/experienceand then it's back to the same ""sweaty"" reality  What you just worked hard to get will beby designmuch less usable and fun in a monthtops"

Then suddenlyhe told us to get back in the truckwe were told we were meeting up with another squadwhich was under heavy fire and needed reinforcements I sat in the front watching the viewnext to the squad leader and the driverand then-the truck grinding to a halt I turned to my squad leaderwho yelled ""PRESS F1 GET OUT GET OUT ENGAGE""panicking at how long it took I fumbled three timesmiraculously getting out unscathed from the hail of bullets smashing into the front window All around me little blips were showing up demanding medical attention as soldiers in our squad went down one after the other The squad leader yelled ""SETUP THE MG AIM AT THAT HOUSE OVER THERE"" before hetoowent down I couldn't even see where the bullets were flying from All I heard was shrapnelricochetand screams of ""MEDIC!

The other squad's leader grabbed the medic from his squad and ran out the buildingshouting that he was going to setup a rally away from the fightingleaving his men in the bloody firefightmy revived SL and the rest of the squad opened fire from another building they had occupied The enemy was under enfiladegetting fired on by two sides Artillery rained down on them I cheeredwooping as they were surely obliterated As I stumbled out of the buildingmy SL checked my stats and remarked""Well doneyou're doing good for a new medic!""that was the first skirmish We haven't even flipped the first flag yet Come on! Onto the objective!""I think to myself dear Lordwar is hellAfter several thousand hours of playing this game over the course of 3 yearsI guess I can review itand you basically will not win a match if your team does not work together This is glaringly obvious when you are on a team that is not working together The game has decent visuals and is more hardcore than many other shooterswhich if you like low TTKstrategic positioningand general small unit tactics then this game will mostly cater to you This game is really fun if you play it with players who actually understand military concepts as you can accomplish much more (The game is not so rigid that it is a milsim however) The mechanics are not well explained so the time you spend trying to excel at mastering the game will feel fulfilling when you see improvement in your skill It tries to be a middle ground between ARMA and Battlefieldand I can safely say thatyeah it does at least come closebut I feel it leans a bit more towards battlefield minus destructive environments and little to no customization The community leaders are generally helpful to players wanting to try the gameand dedicated servers means that hackers are hardly a problem Modding really increases the cool factor of the game and adds contentwhile willing to help new players is just as quick to dismiss or demonize and try to ruin the experience/reputations of their fellow players/servers/clans The clans can be cool while you are in thembut they often get toxic fast As the game can get very competitive it really draws in a lot of try-hards who are not the nicest If you are a seasoned playerthe constant influx of new players from free weekends/sales can drive you nuts with asking questionsnot knowing the gameand playing the game like Call of Dutyor by just being extremely toxic like its CS:GO TBH you can't really blame them too much because there just isn't a tutorial that is in-depth enough to cover every thing or enough to tools to handle the issues Eventually though they leave or adapt and the game will generally play better again Admins are not always present so the game can sometimes be play at your own riskyou will spend most of your in-game time warning or banning people and out-of-game time getting shit on by players who 'dindu nuffin' and want you to un-ban themor getting trolled by groups who are bored Most players have no loyalty to any one serverand so admins/players will flip flop to new placesrequiring you to constantly look for staff or playersand on top of the issues i mentioned you will spend hours every day trying to populate your server to get a match going If you don't have a clan or large community willing to try to populate dailygood luck Additionallysome of the guidelines that the devs want you and your admins to stay within do seem kind of limitingI do not foresee the game staying popular for very longas I feel a competitor may outdo the current product fairly soon (ie BF3 reality mod)playing the game(note: not admin-ing) a couple times a dayor every once in a while with some close friends (preferably ones with military experience and ones who are mature enough to handle losing) will give you the best experience Don't play this game for more than a few matches a day or you may go insaneCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - Nothe game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armorthen proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawnthen you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so muchif you do not communicate)running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killedespecially if you're new to tactical shootersyou need a drivergunnercommander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun) Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bouncebut even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)here are my personal tips:shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)but remember to join a squadgenerally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m Sometimes it is the right choicebut before you know which is whichit's a good idea to hold on for a medicdo not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a foolthan attacking But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyonewith in-depth enough mechanicswhile also being easily accessablecheck out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)I might have 380 hours in this gamebut I still have no idea who am I shooting atLike ARMA except you don't have to pretend that you're having funmy wife also left me while i played  this game  very realisticImagine instead of writing Shakespeare you get 50 monkeys together to create and execute a military operation against another 50 monkeysI've have over 3k hours on this gamefrom CQB to long range to hit boxesSquad is a game that strikes the middle ground between Battlefield and Armabut I'm sure you've heard that before I'll be a bit more specificand then half coordinate what you're going to do (Usually sneaking behind enemy lines and getting that Conquest Flag)then this game probably suits you The gameplay is essentially your Squad Leaders talking to each othertrying to coordinate what to do Then they relay to their Squads what the plan is Then you do that thing Simpleright? Wellnot quite There are a lot of moving parts in each game I'll explainsuch as GrenadierRiflemanMarksmanLight and Heavy Anti-TankMachine Gunner (with three variations)and some other funky ones like Combat Engineer and Raider That isn't including vehicles crewman/pilots Each game will be diffferentas Squad Leaders changeSquadmates changeand with each map change you often have to readjust your squads strategy and role kits to best suit the plan If you were the previously mentioned Battlefield player with a modicum of strategythen you'll fit right in with being a Squadmate under a Squad Leaderand for your first few games I would recommend either Rifleman or Medicjust to get your bearings and start understanding the game I would also recommend telling your Squad Leader that you are newthat way they will better know your skill level and plan accordingly I personally have only met one or two Squad Leaders who say they don't want new peopleso if you run into one like that you can always switch Squads or Servers I would also HIGHLY recommend having a micit doesn't matter if it's amazing as long as it works and people can hear you clearlythen I would say to branch off and try to play Machinegunner and Light Anti-Tank (don't take Heavy) After a few more games of thatlet's say you're at 8-15 hours Then I would personally say you are more than welcome to branch out into either more complicated and niche Squad roleslike Combat EngineerOR you can move onto Armour or Helicopterstherefore I will touch on it only briefly Armour (I am spelling it with a U as I am Canadianit is not a typo) is fun if you like blowing other vehicles sky high and being afraid of towns You will most likely be enemy vehicle hunting for most of the gameand providing support to infantry so that they can capture a point or destroy an enemy FOB (you'll learn what FOB is in gamebut it is essentially a player-made base that you can spawn and resupply on) If you get really really good at armouryou and a couple friends/squad mates can pretty much solo win games (againif you play really well and coordinate with your team even better) WellI guess this wasn't brief Oh wellnext!getting information for your teamand being the hero who picks up an entire squad while hovering inches from a cliff If you enjoy being chill and playing the long gameand having brief moments of extreme intensitythen helicopter pilot is the way to go Just don't become Black Hawk Down and lose your team tickets ;)after you have been playing for 20-30 hours and have a basic concept of most things in the gameyou can/should hop into Squad leading If you want to be an effective Squad leaderyou have to incorporate everything you've learned in the past 30 hoursand use that to help your team win the game Just like when you're first starting out I would recommend telling your allied Squad Leaders that you are new to Squad Leading It's helpful for other Squad Leaders to know You can/should (in my opinion) tell your Squad that you are new to Squad Leadingbut not the gameand that while you may not be the bestyou will try your bestyou can try out Commander after some games Squad Leadingbut to do it effectively I would recommend having a lot of SL games OR joining a Clan It sounds weirdbut many Clans will help newer players (and experienced ones) learn the gameand their desired specialization such as Squad Leadingany Squad roleHelicoptersor Armouredjust to make it a balanced review/tutorialand will curse out other players or intentionally make bad calls to lose the gamelike leveling or weapon level The only thing to show how skilled you are is your skill It's kind of a 50/50 con/prodepends on your opinionespecially ones with varying skill levels If you just stay polite and continue trying to winyou'll be a-okayand the learning curve is difficult for someone unexperienced in this type of game I myself never really played a strategic shooter (unless you count Tarkovwhich I count as a tactical shooter) before this gameso learning to work with everyone and come up with plans at the beginning was difficultand then suddenly their team starts silently taking out your HAB/FOBs from behind Suddenlyyour last HAB is being overrun and you lose the game shortly afterbecause you can't reinforce the objective in time Take from each loss a lessonso that you can move forward with experienceSquad isn't a game for everyone There isn't a progression system or a battle-royale modebut what it does have is engaging gameplay with tons of room for growthconstant replayabilityand an amazing community If you even think that you MIGHT like this gamebuy it on steamhumblebundleor wait for a free weekend (they are pretty common) If you stick around after your first few hoursthen that means that you'll be around for a long time coming Thank you for reading this long reviewand I hope to see you out there soon![h1]One of the few multiplayer games that reminds me that people can be amazing[/h1]I've seen some sh*t I've seen people crumbleI've lost friendsI've watched people eat each other even when they are winning When people are supposed to be working together and yet they would rather treat their ally like trash because they refuse to take the blame for their own wrongdoingexecuteand accomplish masterful plans to outsmart their enemy I've seen teams rally from the depths of defeat and flip unwinable games into incredible victories Heros emerging from the storm of mortars landing upon their bunkerto squad leaders risking their own lives to save those of their

originally didI have been playing it ever since-Plays on a Afghan map on the US Teamcan't scatter due to constrained wallsgo prone and jump on the Grenade and begins to cheer for my selfless sacrificeSo for reference I'm a child playing an advanced military simulation and I join one of my first gamesI spawn in and immediately my squad leader brings me over to an anti tank weapon and just tells me to blow everything that goes down the road the fuck upserious goofballsor legit fucking monkeys its greatespecially if you are newask them what you gotta do and you'll have an amazing

medical kit to stop the bleedinghelps me forget about herIf you never played this game please for the love of god follow these 3-4 stepsAfter just reaching 1000 hours in SquadI can say wholeheartedlythat this game was worth every pennyand every hour I have owned this game since it was just a foundation of what it is todayand never did i ever think that this game would evolve into what it is today The development team is very proactiveand does a really good job of listening to the playershelicopter transportartillery barrages when you least expect them To say this game is immersive is quite an unfair understatement I wish i had a heart rate monitor on sometimesas things can get seriously hairy Like defending the police station on the new map Mutahaall by yourselfagainst  25 something US soldiers and a Bradley IFV You're positioned across the streetand have an angle on just about everyone With so many targets and potential ways to die you begin to sweat a littleyour hands begin to feel clammy as you lay your iron sights against your unaware enemy Who do I shoot first? Once I engagewho will notice first? How will I react? This game is in a way a three dimensional game of chessexcept the chess pieces are camoflauged in the treesand have the firepower to scare even the most battle hardened veteran playersI have yet to find any other game that lets one person wreak so much havoc upon a large group of enemies I have walked around corners unsuspectingly to find 5 enemies in the same compound as Iall bunched togetherand i was able to switch to full auto and mow everyone down with one magazine before making a hasty retreat Ohand lets talk about hand grenades While these are a common item in most shooter gamesI've never felt as much impending doom as i've felt in Squad when I see one of those tossed over the wall of the compound i'm in I've seen one tiny hand grenade tossed directly into the center of a compound take out close to half of my team once Imagine 9 or more people all with microphones screaming ""GRENADE!!!"" in unisonwith audible terror in their voicesand scrambling to find something to hide behind that can withstand the blast Most don't make it  I know i didn't Now i'll recognize that familiar ""Pop!"" of a grenade being tossed anywhereand in my opinion gives one of the most fulfilling gaming experiences possible"

1,"Greatest FM ever. Too expensive howeverTLDR 7.8/10 - WORTH buyingbut NOT a MUST BUY.I've basically won every trophy this seasonhowever I did get incredibly lucky in the UCL Semis where I beat City on Aggregate 1-0 (with a total of 3shots over 2 games) woops. Did some major changes to my squadSOLD PogbaMartialMaguireFred and Costato fund my BUYS J FelixHaalandMarquinhosAouarR Neves and Donnarumma. Massive changes to structurebut hope things go well in my 6th season. (After this seasoni'm starting a fresh save)trust meI've collected more than 1500hrs in each FM that comes out each year(from fm10-19) (Yea probably need a life).but gives a nice feelI buy the game in support of the developers for all the years and hours of fun it's given me. So i've already grown to know what to expect as each year goes by. Its the same gameits just refreshedsquads updatedand some small nice additions. The development center seems to be a very nice addition to the gamehowever i'm not deep enough into the game to warrant a full conclusion on how it really performs.nothing ground breakingnothing overzealousjust simple and what you need. Lookthis year its again a simple facelift plus some. The addition of a handful of small new featuresand the big addition of the development centerits good. Thats it. Expect the game to be as how it always has been.seem to miss too many or hit them directly at the keeper. Maybe its just my poor forwardsno cluehave to keep monitoring.are really minutematch engine tweaks have been a LITTLE BIT betterbut still far from perfect. Still dislike the 1-on-1 failures and shooting from impossible acute angles. But its better than the start of BETA.but nothing that jumps at you as a MUST BUY series. Good game as always nonetheless.This is the fastest I'm dropping an FM gameand by a MILE. 29 hours might not seem like much but for someone who has thousands and thousands of hours combined between previous editions going back to Championship Manager 4it was enough.giving you control over more things than everwith some littlesometimes unnecessarybut cool touches... in the end it delivers on most promises bar onethe crucial aspect - the match engine. That one doesn't seem like you can control it AT ALL.or the conversion rate of 1-on-1'sand it's all true.and for that the team can take full credit. You've lured me in. Even with limited time I've decided to come back to the franchise after two yearsso kudos to the marketing team.responsibilities) instead of keeping it simple got messybut it's not a big deal.except for... the game itself. The match engine just doesn't cut itand while I don't believe that's the caseit literally feels like it was an afterthought this year. To the extent that I wouldn't be surprised if someone told me this engine was created from scratch in like 100 hours.your team does the same things for the most part regardless of the instructions... The game gave me no joyeven when winning. I wasn't winning. My team wasn't playing the way I wanted. The majority of goals scored had nothing to do with the style of play my tactics were using.thinking it would affect the outcome.but even at FM's worst points the game didn't disappoint me to such an extent.AI teams always going bankrupt... BANKRUPT SIMULATOR 2020 )Good gamebut you got to make a discount.The price is too high for a game which released 4 months ago!Everything apart from the matches is superbbest FM ever.so SI nerfed the conversion rates of one-on-one chances to keep scorelines acceptable. The result howeveris that your world class  striker misses 2-5 easy chances every game.instead preferring to shoot from obscenely acute angles rather than play the ball across the box.and yet over 50% of the crowd are dressed in orange. It diminishes the match experience and detracts from the game as a whole.broken for 2 months nowI've bought every game in this series since the year 2000I pre-order every year (literally the only game I will do so with) and said I'll continue to do so until I get burned. WellSI Gamesyou've broken me at last. The 'Bugs' section of your forum is littered with these issues that are ""under review""well you can consider my purchase of FM 2021 in the same category.you'll thank me for it.Every year we see improvements here and therethis year that's not an exception. Although still far from perfectthe 3D engine and graphics were improvedsmall tweaks through out the entire game and interfacemore tactical response from the players in the pitchimproved relationships and the biggest focus for this new edition The youth prospects and the future of your club and carreer. Now the club's objectives are set on a more accurate and demanding way and the young players are really taken into consideration regarding the next few years. It's fair tosomehowsay that this new edition is ""more of the same""but in the end it's refreshing and its changes are enough to renew our desire and hunger to keep playing year after year this amazing game. I play since the very first edition back in the 90'severy year I spend long hours playing. I was a teenager by that time and I'm a 41 years old married father today. I never get fed up of this gameno matter what.I love football manager and I genuinely regret buying this game.despite two updates and promises that it will be sorted. This is a football management game where the strikers can't score one on oneswhich therefore renders all counter attacking football as useless. I've been a huge fan of the series for a decade but this is the worst one I've ever played.Beware...you might never leave your house.This game (and the games before it) converted me into a football fanand I had barely any appreciation of sports before that point.in gaming termslike a grand strategy RPG. You have the grand strategy element of heaps and heaps of numbers going up and down and the initial confusion of understanding what any of them meanas well as being able to play for 400 hours (like I have) and realise you understand absolutely nothing about the gameand still having that creeping feeling that you really don't know what you're doing.and you have to balance your match day squad as best as possible. It's not just a case of ""who's best at what"" (although sometimes it can be) - you might need to settle a disgruntled playeror give one of your younger players a chance to shine and get some experience in the first team.cringing when your team has an awful defeat and cheering when they do well. Were you responsible? Was it just RNG? Who knowsbut it's funisn't it? Trying to work out what's actually you and what is just smoke and mirrors is part of the fun.even if you're not a fan of football and sportif you have an interest in grand strategy or complex RPGs you may just appreciate the incredibly diverse and immersive game that has the potential to grab you here. For meplayers like Alessandro RossiHendrick Weydandt and Luismi are burned into my brainand I've gotten a brand new appreciation for the complexity and nuance that the sport of football has. This IS the beautiful gamebut not as you know it.Each edition of FM stands or falls with its match engineand 2020 is unfortunately one of the poorest entries in that regard. The problems in the vanilla version have already been covered in many reviewsand hoping that the most recent update had improved thingsI gave it another spin. The outcomes are no longer quite as absurd as they used to bebut still miles from acceptable. World-class forwards waste chance after chancegoalkeepers win pretty much every one-on-oneand most goals come from standards. There are some interesting UI updates and streamlining of various sections that are an improvement over earlier editionsbut the constant match day frustration makes this one an inferior entry over its last few predecessors.PLEASE put a discount on for this time of need. I LOVE Football Manager but with issues with money because of COVID19its extremely expensive.I think there's a lot more to come from you and I completely believe you've got what it takes.Fotball manager is always solid fun. Developing a club is such a rewarding thing. I do wish that they would not release a new game every year. More development would benefit the gaming experience. A rooster update every year would satisfy more players.Understandablyas someone who has clocked up roughly 8500 hours playing the FM series thus far from CM00/01 to the current iterationI'd like to think I know what makes a good Football Manager game and what has historically let the series down. FM20 does the best job of any instalment so far of improving and expanding on the good and dealing with the negatives.Cruyff turnsstop-and-goall represented here in the best match engine to date. Yes the crowd animations are repetitive but you know whatif you want to play FIFAgo and play FIFA.friendworry not! Along with all these new options comes a wealth of new staff responsibilitiesand you can delegate or take charge at your leisureLike to finalise signings but don't really care about the scouting side of things? Delegate it. Prefer to find those hidden gems yourself but couldn't care less about negotiating their contracts? Suredelegate it. Want to keep an eye on your blossoming U23 side but the U18s are just too far off your radar right now? Guess what? Delegate it.everything you can think of that would improve the series from FM19 is here. Data presentation is fantasticplayer development and progression is as close to perfection as it could be. FM20 makes the complicated things seem simple and makes the simple things seem effortless. To methis is now THE Football Manager title.FM20 is a defining moment in the history of Football Manager titles. Make no mistakethis one is a classic. Though you may not find the next Tonton Zola Mokouko sitting in Derby County's reservesevery story you do write for yourself on this genre-defining game will carry its own memories and legacy and surely that is the highest praise of all.Game is good but the price is ridiculous for a glorified patch with 1 or 2 extra features.Was free on EPIC last week.Last night I calculated my Football Manager playtime since I first purchased FM2013. It was 5929.7 hours. So now I finally feel qualified to review it.Here is what I'll say about if you should purchase this or notits too expensive"

It gives you a chance to try the classes you've only sat across the table from Try new card combos and items or enhancements The Guildmaster mode (which is basically the main game right now)lets you quickly jump into a scenario and playall the campaignand starts into the Expansions I can't get enough Gloomhaven TBHand this game just gives me one more way to play it If you're a GH Junkie like meyou need this game Buy it!Bought this because I had no one to play the board game with irlnow I can play by myself and have fun! Thanks Gloomhaven!I think this may be my first review in all of my years on Steamwe are now about 4 months into the Early Access version of this game and I wanted to really highlight the development team's handling of itsubstantial changes to the core elements of their Adventure mode variant of this board game adaption alreadyconsistent additions towards that eventual goalmy confidence in the team that will be able to eventually deliver that faithful port of the physical board game has grown tremendously since they seem to be completely on track with their road map thus far They even amended their road map through this process to include shifts in priorities based on community feedbackwhile I have no station to guarantee it will happenI feel quite confident that they will be able to follow through on their promise to create a truedigital adaptation of Gloomahven In the meantimethe adventure mode that is constantly evolving several times per month is already worth the modest asking price as I've already put over 100 hours into the gameincluding almost all of the playable characters and over 100 scenariosThe game is still in early accessso features from the board game are being added slowly; currently there's only five heroesand the full campaign from the board game hasn't been added (you have a randomly-generated mode instead)  Even the existing heroes don't yet have all their skills  Additionallythe devs have been forthright with the fact that adding the full game and all the classes will take some time  If you want to play with [i]everything[/i] you may want to waitif you're fine with early access limitationsthis is a very good game  The developers are responsive and have tweaked it in response to user feedback; right noweven with all its limitationsthe randomly-generated mode is quite funTwo words: Early Accessand you can play solo through as many scenarios as you like If you enjoy turn-by-turn tactical puzzles then this is pretty funat least at firstand there is no larger campaign No story No larger goal Pretty quickly it gets to feel like ""been there and done that"" I've maxed out three of the character classes and learned a lot about how to play the game I'll probably try the other character classes But after that I'll probably set it aside until the full version of the game is finishedyou probably want to wait[h1]IN A WORD: [b]COMPELLING[/b][/h1]turn-based tactical combat and compact dungeon-crawling With abstracted elements providing adventuring servicesand minor character and party management Set in a dark fantasy world with a nomadic aesthetic Where players take a group of up to four mercenaries on a series quests to defeat a myriad of enemies and level-up their characters while hunting for treasurebut with a number of subtle differences The GM mode plays more like a sandbox with generic quests when compared to the campaign Which consists of up to 95x unique story-linked scenarios in the guise of core and side-queststo overcome Perhaps the biggest difference between modes is that in the campaign characters take on take on a personal quest that when achievedforces the mercenary to retire and a new one called in their placecustomisation and the inevitable trainers Cooperative online sessions for between two and four playersrequire an invitation code be sent to participantsgiving gamers the possibility of taking on the role of gamemaster and/or the mercenariesattack modesstrengths and weaknesses Plus 7x bosses to defeatthat plays somewhat like a sandboxForest & Dungeon that can become overfamiliar with extended playsettings and visuals it certainly proved enchanting to take a look at The deeplayeredcomplexity generated by copious mechanics make this a dream for fans of tactical board type games Though it should be noted that on standard and higher difficulties the campaign possesses a seemingly strong level of pre-determination and a puzzle like quality to its gameplaythis would have been UNMISSABLE As it is casual gamers be wary; the Guildmaster mode will be enjoyablethe Campaign mode not so muchgo off-Steam to:I already love this game  It's been available for just over an hourbut I eagerly installed it  I played through my first scenario with a Brute and Scoundrel  It's great  It's super faithful to the board gameand I really wish I didn't have to go to work right nowbut it would just be nice to have that extra confirmation of what my attack did in a text logand I'm sure there will be improvements here and there  ButI am really amazed that I played through the first scenario without seeing anything incorrect  AndI definitely used the cards to full advantage (pushed and pulled into traps)  Maximized my looting  Really great job!  Best Day 1 early access experience in a whileA few hours in so far My thoughts are generally positivebut it definitely feels very early access at this point Disregarding the fact that the main modes (multiplayer and campaign) are not yet accessibleI'm only critiquing what is currently playablewhich is a sorta randomized adventure campaign that you can play solo with 2 charactersso you need to know how all that stuff works already There is a work-in-progress Youtube tutorial videobut you would never be able to play the game after watching that you need help info during combat to explain what is happening To be clear I'm not really knocking the game for thisit's kinda expected for early access This is more just a warning to anyone thinking of trying this out if you haven't played the board gamewhen a round startsyou don't see the modifier cards that the enemies pull unless you mouse-over each enemy to see what they're going to do that round This is very unlike the board game where you individually pull each card to see what the enemy does that turn Another problem is that the attack modifiers that you pull on each attack are super understatedand it took me a while to even notice where it was showing this it's tiny tiny text over the enemy's health bar that appears for like 1 second and then disappears This needs to be like a big overlay center screen that says ""+1"" or ""2X""so it's really clear what is happening on each attack I constantly have things happen and I'm like ""waitwhat happened there? why did he not die? did he negate that or something?"" It doesn't help that there is no battle log so you can't just look back at the last move to get the summarythen at other points to specify the attackthen at other points to specify the push directionetc it can be confusing to figure out what the game is asking you to specify at any one momentand it can be real finicky about accepting what you're telling it and moving onto the next step In some cases I've had it actually get stuck at a certain step and refuse to let me back out of that like I had a movement action where I selected that movement just to see what my options wereand it locked in the movement and wouldn't let me undo or back out of the action the only option I had was to confirm the movement which I didn't want to do (and it forced me to walk into a trap) But in general during these steps it really needs some text or visual indication of exactly what action you're doing right now so you don't have to just intuit what the game is trying to get you to dowhich can be a problem when you're trying to make a decision and there is UI covering the characters like when you need to decide if you're going to take the damage or lose a card instead it's important to know how much health the character has for this decisionbut in a lot of cases you can't see their health because that specific choice UI covers itthey are just a background with nothing to do there I feel like I'm missing somethingI'm still having a lot of fun with it because Gloomhaven is just plain fun and the original game mechanics are pretty much there Looking forward to all the improvementsI've played the board game and all of it's expansions extensively andin my humble opinionGloomhaven is the absolute pinnacle of strategic turn based card combat in any game ever The digital version is fantastic at not only recreating the game in virtual spacebut also creating new fun ways of playing the game I would highly recommend any fan of board games or dungeon crawlers get this game (or the real board game and it's expansions for that matter)This is an amazing digital recreation of my favorite board game of all time As of writing thisthe full campaign has not yet been releasedbut the Guildmaster mode alone is worth the price of entryit's a turn basedco-opRPGstrategy game in which players choose from their deck of cards to guide their character through a series of dungeon crawls  There are a variety of enemieseach with different abilitiesrequiring different strategies to overcome  The rules are low-to-medium complexityand this digital version takes much of the more complex work (the rules dictating the AI) out of your hands  There is character progression via gearHPnew cardsand card modificationdo yourself a favor and pick up this digital version  It is fairly faithful to the physical board gameand removes much of the busy work (eg no setupno AI to manage)  The graphics do a great job of bringing the board game to lifeand the game is beautiful without requiring high end hardware  I believe these games are always best played with friendsbut I have spent many hours enjoying playing this version solo - something I couldn't do with the physical board gamebut even cranked all the way upoutside of missions where new enemies constantly spawnan adept player will almost never fail a mission  There are mods available to increase difficultybut as of this writingsuch mods are not functional in multiplayer gamesGood attempt at the actual board game My only issue really is that there is no well implemented undo button for botched turn picks All they need is to have the undo option let you rechoose card orderempowering thingsusing itemsetc If you miss a stepthere's no going backwhich ruins a whole dungeon sometimes I've lost many times when I really shouldn't have from a faulty click with no option to go backeven though the execution hasn't even been finalized Still recommendedbut that UNDO button is badly neededas other reviewers will also tell youI've never played the Gloomhaven Boardgame so i did a deep divenot really preparedit will take more than 2 hours to go thru with itkeep that in mind if you want a chance to refund it Maybe watch a video on YT first before palying (digital) Gloomhaven at allat least at the start until you knowwhat you do After that you can play a quick adventure here and there and build your guild  & toons upGloomhaven is still in Early Access  It's very playablethoughwith a lot of content  The latest update introduced a new sort of story mode they call ""Guildmaster""  You basically run a guild of dudesand go exploring for dangertreasurefameand gloryand I know manymany others agreeGloomhaven is one of the best board games ever made  And this digital version is EXACTLY the board game converted to PCand the interface is smooth as silk  One of the best board game interfaces I've played on PCbut they just introduced a brand newcomprehensive interactive tutorial that really helps out immensely  There is also a ""How to Play"" rulebook in-game that you can access at ANY TIMEeven in the middle of a fight  Which is nicebut they promise the FULL campaign from the original board game  This will be an outstanding and immense campaignwith 80+ unique and hand created missionsgear to find and equipbonuses to discoveretc  The game is a blast to play if you like fantasy board games  It really is a wonderful digital adaptation and it nails the board game rules without deviationnothing to complain about here  The characters and monsters are really detailed and look great!highly recommended even now in early access  The new Guildmaster update really adds a ton of contentand it's almost like a full campaign in its own rightbut they still give it two very dark sunglasses up  The band they got back together really enjoys it too!If you're a fan of the board gameyou should get this game  All of the funnone of the set up time  Scenarios take 10-20 minutes instead of 1-2 hours  No more arguing over line of sight or monster focus/move mechanics  The AI takes care of all that for you  The multiplayer mode is fantastic and the introduction of Guildmaster is a welcome improvement from the free-play adventure modethe game is still in Early Accessso there are a handful of bugs  Nothing too major  My friends and I had to restart the game a handful of times when the game bugged outbut luckily it auto-saves at the beginning of every roundso there's no need to restart the scenariothe Steam game is a good place to start to learn the rules and mechanics  It will save you a lot of time reading the rulebookonline FAQsand googling ambiguous situationsIt is only appropriate that one of the most ludicrously ambitious board games ever should get one of the most ambitious ports ever It is far better than I'd have dared hope for - combining faithful translation of the board gameexcellent UXand decadent 3d graphics The departures from the board game are all good choices: resolving AI ties with randomness instead of player choicereplacing a couple abilities that would have made the interface much worseetc In additionit is both wonderful and kind of insane that they added an entirely new semi-random campaign mode (""Guildmaster"")that is arguably better than the original's campaignbut since they have provided modding supportit's not too big a problemwowgreat job Flaming Fowl!!Updated 11/10/20 for the City Streets release! I'll abbreviate my updates for this release with ""CS""but resetting and playing with other people is extremely difficult and largely impracticalI was stokedespecially since most of my gaming group moved over the past few monthsso goodI have to say While this isn't the campaign experience from the board game at this time - that's coming later - what's here so far is solid I appreciate the developers making sure each new mercenary they release is done rightthis is early accessso features are light right now and bugs are aplenty Here's what you'll get as of this writing:moneyenhancementsand perk pointsnot every mission)but is easily resumablethoughthere are [strike]a *lot*[/strike] of bugswhich is par for the course with early access Here's what my friend and I have seen playing together co op:but does still occur Typically what happens is my online session as host terminates suddenly and my friend is kickedforcing him to quit and rejoin my session[/strike] CS: These seem fixed!allowing them to be used a second time (yay?)[/strike] CS: These seem fixedtooso they are always used immediately when the encounter starts (but do refresh properly on long rest) CS: Still seems to be the caseand I am wondering if this is a design decision at this point rather than a bug?but gameplay can be slow and it'd be nice to have a 2x speed option (especially for solo play)no matter how long it's been since the prior clickso it's very easy to accidentally start an attack without hitting all available targets There is no confirmation for skipping targets like there is for skipping whole card effectsbut for standard movement this should absolutely be an option Finding out you hit the wrong hex and you're out of range for something when you could have been elsewhere sucksthere's no undo action for card effects that will not actually affect anything until future actions For instanceif I apply a buff to myselfthen change my mind and want to moveI should be able to do that - the buff doesn't matter until I've done anything elseafter allwhich is bad and confusing During setupcards are deselected by left clicking them again During the roundcard actions are deselected with a right click Enemies are deselected with a right click as well Given the above noteaccidentally left clicking an enemy a second time to undo will launch your attackso hopefully you were done picking targets :Dwhich is something I hadn't specifically noted in this review but was a very pleasant surprisehere's my 2 cents:you should absolutely buy it nowyou won't find it yet and should waitwatch some streams? This is fun and I'd probably like it anywaybut your mileage will definitely varybut my core evaluation remains the same Great updatethoughwith lots of new content and a lot of minor improvements!This is an extremely faithful adaptation of the tabletop game (for those who aren't awareGloomhaven has been the #1 board game on BoardGameGeek for about 3 years now) As of June 24 2021the game is only missing the board game's campaignwhich would be a bummer if it weren't for Guildmaster modewhich acts as a sandbox campaign with a whole ton of content and the entirety of the game's roster of mercenaries for you to play with and experimentgiven that the game is in Early AccessI'd say it is in a very good place Wholeheartedly recommended to anyone looking for a great tactical skirmish experience It cannot be overstated just how good the turn to turn gameplay is!there's now a x3 speed up button and the campaign is in beta!This is a great automated version of Gloomhavenentirely faithful to the original (though campaign isas of early accessnot complete yet) If you enjoy strategic boardgamesthis is an easy purchase If you enjoy Gloomhaven specificallythis might be a ""Must Buy""even though we are in early accessthis game is fun as hell Dev's appear to be good communicatorsthey've got a roadmap for the evolving nature of the productand have got something pretty damn good builtSo let me start this review by saying that yesI do own the board game I have a 178 hours into Gloomhavenmost of which I accumulated during Early Access playing the Guild Master mode I am currently playing the campaign modeand I have done the bulk of those hoursoutside tutorialsin multiplayerfor me the challenge is my gaming group is almost always 5 people which is one too many For referenceI do play a lot of board game digitallyThrough the AgesCarcassone and Ticket to Rideto name a few I also love ZombicdeHero Quest (got the new edition this week)Vindication and 7 wonders to name a few physical gamesbut the person can rejoin the game at the start of the next roundwhen you pick your cards It would be better if they could join while a round is in progressbut the disconnects are not frequentalthough I would have no issue added a third and either do 3 or one person gets twonot readily throw your turn away because the card system is both your lifeyour time limit and your abilities This can make for some surprising interaction and decisions and sometimes luck and some pretty hilarious accusations when your partner does something really dumb or brilliantmost people will find one more classes that suit their playing style It's great fun to play in Guild Master mode or the Campaign You unlock characters in both They just play so differently though that it's great and rarely feels stale even if you've been playing for a while and are moving onto a new onewell you can learn Some of the classes are complicated and not easy to really get the hang ofbut you really don't have to focus on the characters you really hate playing if you don't want to If there is more than one of youwell your partners might love what you hate anywaysome explorationa lite story now and then and chance encounters It's a coop board game that allows everyone to play the game and not try go be some game master or something that separates you from the other You can also do something meaningful in an hour to hour and a half I mean this isn't Divinity or Neverwinter Nights or a full fledged RPG experiencebut it is a great digital version of a board game many people love or love to hateunique decks for each classinteresting mapslots of monsters that behave differentlythe maps with traps and obstacles can change your strategythe campaign has bosses with unique decks and challenges even decisions to be made It's a lot of stuff without the 2 hour affair of separating componentswell this is nice way to jump right in each nightgive it a try You never knowyou might just really enjoy it enough to play night after night and still feel the thrill of trying another roundseeing another encounter or trying to remember what the heck those plant looking people are called"
0,"As a person with a disability of not having use of my hands to play regular games I have found a passion in clicker and idle gameswith that saidthis is the best clicker game I have ever played and it is still in early access It has already beaten the competition and has great potential for so much more! Thank you for the hours of entertainment I shall find myself lost in000 hours  This had the potential to be a great game  But three years init's become more cash-grab than anything else  Want the best gear?  Paywall  Spent actual cashmoney on a character?  Said character gets nerfed to oblivion  That's why it's important that they have that 'Early Access' tag on the game  So they can make good characterscollect the money from playersand then nerf it to the point that nobody will use it in their formation  Now they've put event characters behind a paywall toobecause you won't have enough currency in the form of Time Gate Pieces  Prior to this changeyou could pick up all the previously released characters in a particular event by simply running each variant once  Nowyou have to pay Time Gate Pieces  It'll cost you 12/event to pick up the characters you missedescalating by 6 per year  You know how ELSE you can get previously released characters?  Whyyesyou guessed it  PAYWALL!  Fork over that cashmoneysucka!Crusaders of the Lost Idolsthe devs gave characters 3 item slots  Here they have 6with the standard CommonUncommonRare & Epic varieties  BUT WAIT!  What if you haven't had much luck opening the chests you earned for free by playing an event?  PAYWALL!  Alsowith the addition of Golden Epicsyou have ANOTHER opportunity to give them money  A Golden Epic is TWICE as effective as a normal epic  GET THAT WALLET OUT!there is a Golden Epic released EVERY weekendwith an additional one released for each new character every two to three weeks  If you want to keep upthat's a minimum of five bucks/week + the new character one  You'll need to spend between five and ten bucks depending on the week  But then you'll have a Golden Epic and a bunch of Uncommons or Rares on the character  So you'd better spend MORE than the minimum of $5 to get that GE  Probably better to spend ten or twenty so you get some SHINIESwhich are 50% more effective than the normal item rarityso that every 10 of a SINGLE kind of chest you open will have an Epic in it   But ten bucks will get you 7 chests plus the three you get for free from running a character's event missionsso you could be ""unlucky"" (read: normal luck) and have only the GE you bought and one epic from the missionsplus one shiny on a random slot for that character  The $10 option has the 'Most Popular!' with an explosion graphic so you're tempted to spend that MONEY  But the 'Best Value!' is 42 chests for $50 bucks  So if you want to actually gear up a characterGET THAT WALLET OUT!the better you do  Don't spendyou'll be consigned to the bottom end of the power curve  If you like giving your money to blatant cashgrabsI recommend playing the lottery  Skip this onethe QA process is broken at best and nonexistant at worst  Events and new content regularly come out with gamebreaking flaws  Sometimes they're fixed quicklysometimes not  Depends on whether they affect their cashflow from their playersif you do have a problemthe customer service is wildly erratic  Sometimes they'll get back to you quickly and solve your problemsometimes they won't respond at all  Sometimes they'll sayeffectively'Neener Neener' and mark your ticket as resolved after a year  QUALITY customer service (Sarcasm detected)but I just can't take it anymore  I'm doneIn response to the '''review''' pointing out that most of the negative reviews have <50 hours of playtimehere's a guy with over 5k hours telling you to find a better idle game to playand they will sell literally everything possible in the game to get it: chestschampionstime gate piecespotionsscrollscardsfamiliars I wouldn't be surprised if they start selling campaigns in the future Don't get me wrongit is entirely possible to play the game without buying a single thing (like me)but you'll find that you are not the type of player they will cater for and you'll be consistently 'just behind' the peak of progression because of itso I'd be remiss not to point out some others that I've enjoyed:it's the company that's adding them you need to look atnot the playersThis is definitely not for everyoneif you're a new parent looking for something to do with a baby in your other armcatharticidle game that you can sit down at for a few minutes then walk away from No massive pressure ""login"" every 15 minutes You can still make progress just poking at it whenever you have a chance to sit for a few minutesand this definitely fits that over-worked-but-need-something-to-click demographicbut I'm sure there are plenty of Steam users out there who understandIt's one of those games where you've put some time into it only to ask yourself""Why am I even playing this?""then by all meansbut don't expect to get any real joy from thisIf you havenâ€™t played Crusaders of the Lost Idolsget prepared for the deepest clicker everand if you enjoy idle gamesyou ought to give Idle Champions a shotI have a love/hate relationship with this game   You can be successful just grinding away endlessly but to be successful in one's lifetime you really need to pay to play  That bothers methough I have paid to playso maybe that's why  It is extremely addictiveand while I cannot say the time spent is dedicated (mostly checking in every 30-60 minutes to see how things are)I also cannot say it is fun  It's just there  Always Running in the backgroundand the content added sometimes brings nostalgia for past games (like Neverwinter Nightsor D&D obviously)or some of the recent Twitch stream D&D characters playedI am still grinding away much more than a thousand hours later (as of this writing)then this is recommended  If you are not into grindy or hate P2W schemes then avoid this at all costs  As such I am going to give it a slightly thumbs up 501 since there is no maybe button  YMMVOne of the most complex idlers I've seen to date A little too complex to be honest It's greatbut it is very longthere is a lot of strategy involvedand to me the strategy doesn't seem well thought outit is just the byproduct of throwing many random mechanics in the game each update It's power creep at its finest yet there are no safety guardsthey just let it grow more and more out of control each timeyou can't choose who you want to attackor what abilities your champions useand you can't see health bars if enemies are stacked on top of eachother (which they will beby the dozens) you can't remove buffs that aren't helpful (Firebreath potion) Yetthere is such a big focus on these mechanics that if you don't do themyou simply won't progressI'd say it's downright impossible to find the best combinations on your own and to keep up with all the moving parts You absolutely need to search for external guidesopinionscharts and spreadsheets if you want to progress steadily The game is very involvedbut at the same time it feels like you can't do enough if you prefer an active playstyle Meanwhileit's called Idle Championsyet sometimes it doesn't feel like an idle game at all because of the complex strategies needed to make any progress If you were to let the game run for a full yearyou would make very little progress because each ""adventure"" is isolated and self-containedgear you buy could become completely irrelevant once you unlock a better champion They sell chests in packages of $5 to $50 USD This is PER champion and there are 60+ champions in the game Imagine trying to gear all of them via in-game purchases Yesyou can play this game completely F2P (and I suggest you try to) but just the fact that they give you the option to spend thousands of dollars to gain only a bit of an upper edge is absolutely appalling It's one of the biggest traps and I expected a lot better from the devs given how wholesome and accommodating the community isI give the game a thumbs up because I still enjoy itand I do recommend it if you're into idlerssince there's nothing really like it It's just a little ridiculous when you step back and look at exactly what is going on If you do try itbe sure to read some guides if you get stuckand be VERY careful of the in-game cash shopNeverending grind even if you are paying Paying just puts you farther ahead on the same grind Not even in the ballpark for D&D lore either The lore of D&D is what made me want to try itespecially since it's supposed to be set in The Forgotten Realms There is no loreor almost none and what there is isn't very deep or engaging in any way Drizzt stats alone should get someone fired Their answer? They plan to nerf all of the good well used characters and give slight buffs to all of the worthless ones like Drizzt in hopes that people will play the bad ones more Heard of socialism in D&D? Make them all more equallaughable The truth is that by nerfing the good and buffing some of the never used they hope to have a giant cash grab while players have to get better equipment on the garbage ones by buying chest deals that give a gold item or a set number of shiny items I doubt these devs have ever even played pnp D&D and they most likely get the new ideas from cash grab guru's who have also never played D&D What about having to choose between the characters? Want to bring the monk and the rogue pickpocket in the same group? Too bad so sad There are quests that only allow certain characters based on statsalignmentetcI'm not talking about that Every time a new guy gets pooped out of their cash grab officesit gets added to a slot occupied by other characters so you can only choose one from that slot at any given time What exactly would be the trouble in making all of the characters available for quests that they qualify for? If you wanted Minsc and Catti-Brie in a group then you should be able to have themalong with any other combo a player wants Considering what a shallow obvious p2w cash grab this game is the least they could do is let you play who you wanton quests that allow the character anyway (I have to keep throwing in that fine print for the fanboys that will totally miss the point I was trying to make) Lastly the rate that they churn out eventsnew characterspetsnew quests requiring certain group combos with gear levels you'll only get by spending loads of cash on chestsetc means you never get off the hamster wheel if you want to be on top Hamster wheelhey the event ended 2 days agohere's another event with character #386 that you'll need to buy this golden item chest combo forwho cares that he's the 18th bard we've releasedslight exaggeration but not exaggerating the time frame of events and releases of new products There are many fanboys who will defend anything that the devs do or say but with 3000+ hours and playing D&D since the early 80's I think I'm entitled to my opinion Do yourself a favor and play real games instead of idler cash grabs Anyone that says they have 100% completion on this without spending loads of cash is flat out lying 2 thumbs downif I had more thumbs they'd be down tooThis game does what it advertisesand well  It gives you all the correct dopamine injections to let your lizard brain thrive[h1]All of the negatives of their other titlewith very few of the positives[/h1]this is an idlerso don't expect clutch gameplay or anything like thatmay I suggest their other title - Crusadors of the Lost IdolsOP championswhich has always been a strong point of CNEthe negatives:[/b]if you have a slow internet/live far away from the serversyou will have severe loading issues (champions don't appear on screenskills aren't shownenemies are invisible) that will potentially break your gameif you aren't actively trying to get the new championsyou will fall behind It also exacerbates the above re:loading issuesa very forgettable idler - if I wasn't going for the 100% in achievementsI would have avoided entirely[/h1]I have more than 1000 hours in this game I still don't recommend it - as I mentioned aboveI am going for the 100% completionclosing this one seems to yield significantly less gold than if I left it open - hopefully this will change in future patchesthe reload time is awfuldue to the lack of local caching - another reason to keep it runningthan you do and hit a wall after 100s of hoursThis is my newest reason for not getting ANY work done You can set it up and leave it (hence the idle part) and just return for an adjustment every now and thenbut invariably I find myself spending the same amount of time watch the incremental progression of my championsas I did in the old days of yore watching my hard drive defragmentingHere's the rub This is a good game As clicker/idle games go The company is activemore the most part fixes things fastreleases lots of new content It's a great idle clicker game One of the bestachievement hunters and whales They release streams of new skinsfeatsgolden epics and new characters  But I guess that's the name of the beast Though they are ratcheting up the microtransactions more More packssurprise ""special time only"" offersmore skinsdifferent play modes that need extra play time (or money)have a whole bunch of extra money or have an iron will to not be temptedavoid this game Your wallet will thank you But if none of that is an issueit's a damn god game I dumped 13000 hours into it before finally seeing what it was becomingWithout a doubt the most disgustingly monitized clicker game ever Chock full of loot boxes and overpriced consumables with exceptionally low durationsadvertisements for ""Starter Packs"" Charactersitemsand boosts only available for real moneyexcessive ingame item advertisingoverpriced lootboxesReal Money Consumablesand intentionally tedious game design make this a very solid NOTrust meA fair bit of enjoyment for little effort  Definitely worth the cost of admissionbut the amount they ask for things all but guarantees I will never buy anything from this gameIf I play on an ipad and steam I have to buy the same things over and over It should be possible to link the accounts so that I can use the same purchases on both systems   It would be nice to have the option to buy for all accountsIt's a single player game with extremely predatory monetization  Loot boxes will be crammed down your throat every 5 minutes  Also kind of addictivebut I guess that's the whole point  Give this a passGo look at the DLC menuthen come back and tell me this isn't maliciousTLDR: psychological free to play garbage in a D&D skin Play something else insteadThe only satisfaction I've derived is psychological tricks which are all too familiar in gaming nowadays There's goals to progresscurrencies to accrue but it's all so hollow because it's all designed to 1) keep you playing and 2) funnel you into using the storeit costs gold (the most basic currencythe one you earn the most of by 'playing' the game) to 'unlock' the characters in your roster to be placed in the party and it costs gold to level them up And every subsequent character and level costs more And yes the game is designed so you are encouraged to 'grind'especially if you really want to access that level up advantage for that one character or unlock that character further on in the roster And wryly amusing: this is the only D&D game I've 'played' where character levels are meaningless Because they're bought with gold (appropriate for a game such as this)called favour It basically something you only seem to accrueand the more you have the more quickly you'll gain gold when adventuring in that areathencan be unlocked in a different screen Of course for money you can get a lot more/better chests Chests can contain various consumables which increase stats like character power or gold earned and they can also contain gear for the characters in the game (including those you don't have) as well as items which upgrade an item for one of the characters (but only if you have a character with an item in all slots)it gets complicated except not really because it's all a roundabout way to keep you playing and want more and spend money This being a D&D gamethere's special characters or character skins that may be desirable if you watch certain streams and there's events with special currencies an characters which can be earned by playing as well as codes which can be used in 'locked chests' to get different types of chests"

Its a great RTSprobably my favorite game I've ever played which is saying something since I'm well into my 50's and have played 10's of thousands of hours of games both video and otherwiseit reached this stage at the end of its product cycle instead of the beginning which is a tragedy quite franklybut if not CoH2 is one of those games capable of giving a player thousands of hours of gameplay without ever feeling like you've seen it all/done it all  If you have any interest whatsoever in WWII or RTS gamesthis is an automatic buy  Thanks for spending the time to read my review!Update March 29 2018but most of my original criticism still holds It seems the dev team is now focusing on making COH2 a competitive RTS Little real improvement has however been realized The ingredients for a competitive RTS are completely lackingbalance is a total joke Since launch in 2013 their have been numerous patches concerning unit and faction balance Each and every patch has only made the situation worse For example: till January 2018 axis super tanks were exceptionally powerfulespecially in 4vs4 Up to the point that 4 US players would simply not been able to win a fair 4vs4 game against equally skilled players (other than having to buy that 1 OP commander) So now Relic nerfs axis late game tanksup the point where the allied tankscosting less resourcesoutperform their German counterparts Now the allied forces hold a complete advantage over axis in late game in a 4vs4 situation These changes are just not thought trough properly This is just one example of numerous destructive balance changes that have been made I think this game cannot be truly balanced anymore Too many factionsunitscommanders and new mechanics were added over the years Compare the old commanders to the shit the new ones get Its not possible to create a balanced RTS in what feels like a fanmade modthe new maps feel atrocious to playespecially in 1vs1 You are constantly running around trying not to loose that one control point that connects to all your other control points So if you loose that pointyou dont get any resources In the old game natural choke points would eventual erupt from the course of the game Now it feels so tiring to constantly have your supply line disrupted by that one fucking point covered in mines and MG's Also giving factions with early access to suppression a clear advantage You just hold that one point throughout the entire early game Effectively denying your opponent all resources in the most important phase Again: why do you implement this? Poorpoorpoor design choicesit just isn't a serious or competetive RTS anymore If it was to begin with anywayan overpriced in game store with microtransactions and a slow transition into a free2play game This could be related to the 2013 takeover by SEGA and an imposed microtransactions model I would'nt have granted them a single cent if I knew what they would end up trying to do Free2play is coming soon Every update is clear step in the free2play direction In a final assault they want to get everyone to buy the game before they actually make it f2p Like with almost every gamefree2play will demolish of what is left of a once great game If you really want to playjust wait for the free2playits really that fucking bad During the 2015 christmas salecertain items were 75% off Great!is what you might think However these fuckers are so FUCKING greedy that they actually raised the price of certain commanders to 9 euros (instead of the normal 2-3) so that they could pretend giving a -75% discountwhile selling it for the orginal price :^)""no we wont add pay2win commandersbut we actually are adding pay2win commanders""a 40 euro single player campain that didn't add any MP-content and wasn't even worth half of the orginial pricea weird random drop system that they just used to justify their pay2win model""because now you can get it by drop so it doesnt matter were asking outrages prices for content in our store"" (The chance that something drops you actually need or want is nihil and the only thing that really drops are crappy bulletins)I have always defended this game because it was enjoyable and it was a good RTS In the end the game is still finebut the way Relic and Sega want to make money of its player base is not They have crossed the line  In recent patches they have made it clear that they only see's players as a cow to be milked before they send you off to the slaughter in the free2play fuckfest they are planningcomrad!wait for free2play If you really want to play it well the only thing I can say is: get it on sale It would be worth the moneybut be aware of what your getting yourself into and the direction that Relic and Sega are taking this gamebut I think those with deeper historical knowledge and understanding will find it unsatisfying and childish The campaign of COH2 was thus not compelling and (imo) did not paint a complete and historical accurate picture of the Eastern frontIf you are running in to the issue where you can't obtain a free copy of the game because you already have DLC:go to the store page (/app/231430/Company_of_Heroes_2) in your browser (not Steam itself)log in to your Steam accountpress F12 and go to the Console tab of the window that pops uppaste/type  AddFreeLicense('328549');and hit enterNot as good as the first imo but still playable and Epstein didnt kill himselfAnyone who is having issues with the game being locked on the free forever weekendIts a bug and relic is working on fixing it[b]This strategy is in Real Timewhich proved to me that strategies can be not only excitinginterestingbut also beautifully realistic![/b]who with courage are ready to die for the sake of seizing key control points or defending their positions These are truly epic battles that unfold on maps It should be noted that you have a task at your starting point (base)in which you produce your unitssoldiers or equipment Collect this shock groups and participate in exciting battles!in which every soldier and every drop of his blood is like a Victory flag!and bring you a truly unforgettable pleasure from each battle After allthe balance system is made almost perfect! Whether it be 1 vs 1 or 4 vs 4in any caseyou will receive an unforgettable feeling of this spirit of a heavy and bloody Victory that we inherited from our grandparentsas I would not like to talk a lot about the company In factthese are quite good missions in which you can test your knowledge of tactics and strategies You really get more fun from additional missions from the DLC than from the main campaign of the game For this reasonI advise you definitely to buy additional missions that are not related to the main plot of the game You can relate to the main story with ironybecause there is nothing in it! The history that the main story tells us is a unipolar view of the events of the Second World Warso I want to emphasize once again that you should take this view of developers to events of the past with irony and a lighter look And be sure to get a DLC to enjoy the mission and actually get the real Second World Warwhich we were waiting for!but when we talk about strategieswe always put this in the end - because strategy is important for its gameplay and tactical component that captures and strains your mind And we no longer look at the graphics or technologies that the developers use in those games But this game showed me that it can be beautiful! And at the same time excitingand the technologies that are used here add a truly detailed realism of events unfolding on the screen If your computer does not have enough features to get the maximum settings and see all the features of this gamethen this is the case when you have to buy a new HardWare and see this Virtual World in the full palette of colors of Life and Death!After scrolling through many negative reviewsI began to realize that these reviews were not reviewing the game at allthey were just complaining about Relics business choices Now the amount of DLC's  Relic made for this game is shamefulbut the game is amazing and definitley worth the 30 dollars Rather then write a lengthy review i will just have people see how many hours I put into the game and have them judge for themselvesThere is ""Good"" in Goodbye!ThanksHumbleBundleCoH3 when?It's good unless I losethen it's badThere is ""Good"" in Goodbye!This is a game my late brother loved more than all others He'd play this game religiously My favorite memory of him playing this game would be when he'd use the command console to speed the game up 1000x (or close to that) and play entire 1v7 matches in a matter of minutes on the hardest difficulty I would enjoy playing against the computer with him This game has a fantastic multiplayer mode and just being able to cooperate while playing spoiled me too much I will always look back on my time with this game fondly I hope anyone else out there can find just a positive experience with this Have a great dayI have to write this review as it troubles me greatly the way that SEGA are distributing games  I like Company of Heroes 2 and I like playing it just as I like the Total War series but I do not like the precedent that is being set through DLC and need to make others aware of itwhich no sane person would pay!  Pleaseplease wait until the game and all its content are on sale to buy it else you feel like you've had a raw deal  I bought this game for Â£10 from a supermarket when it was on special offer and the deals Steam puts on can undercut that  I felt I had got a good deal but if I had paid Â£2999 I certainly would have felt cheatedmultiplayer serversmodders and the publisher could release updates for the game  Then the bad like publishers releasing buggyunfinished games which would then be patched later  Now we can add to that the insidious practice of DLC (down loadable content) that we must pay for to use  Now I'm a realistsome DLC such as extra levels or new units may be worth paying for where it adds to the game and its here to stay  SEGA aren't the only distributors to sell DLC but in the case of Company of Heroes 2 they do let you know what you haven't got!one theatre of war and some commandersskins and intel bulletins for skirmish/multiplayer (more on that later)  So you have a relativity engaging single player campaign but for multiplayer you quickly realise you've just been sold a 'starter pack' if you will and you're lacking a hell of a lot  That doesn't mean it isn't thereit just you can't use it!Ardennes Assault and Fox company rangers to try and get you to purchase them  It seems the game delights in showing you what you don't haveyou have to see them through the gamethose are: CommandersSkins and Faceplatesall with associated costs  Then you thinwhat have I actually paid for other than the short campaign?  A good Question and the answer raises more questions!Stalingrad Â£699 & Case Blue Â£699)total of Â£1697the cost for all those bits of DLC for multiplayer  For those who arenâ€™t familiar with the Company of Heroes games one of their traits is it allows you to select a commander  who has specific abilities that you can use to gain a tactical advantage during the game  This can be the ability to call in airstrikesoff map artilleryspecial units or uniquely powerful armoured units such as Tiger tanks  In the original game there were three commanders (InfantryAirborne and Armoured)  In this game there are lotsI donâ€™t know how many but thereâ€™s a forum about it somewhere  Initially when you buy the game you get a basic number of commanders for the Soviets and the Werhmacht  (I got a message that as a legacy player Iâ€™d unlocked some so I have a number that werenâ€™t â€˜unlockedâ€™ with the base game)  These are critical for your experience on multiplayer and skirmish as the computer can use commanders you donâ€™t have access to and it will  Likewiseonline players may have access to that German commander who can call in a Tiger Ace (a Tiger tank with full veterancy level) and you donâ€™t have a commander who can call in an equally powerful unit  This makes the game unbalancedso I talked about â€˜unlockingâ€™ commanders and earlier on I mentioned intel bulletins  Intelligence Bulletins change the mechanics of the game and you can select three from a vast number of options  Some are subtle such as giving machine guns a 2% faster rate of fire and some have a greater impact such as giving tanks 20% greater accuracy  You canâ€™t buy these through DLC (thatâ€™s no loss as thereâ€™s already plenty of that) you have to â€˜unlockâ€™ them  You unlock more commandersintel bulletinsvehicle skins and other goodies via the war spoils system  This essentially involves grinding away for hours on skirmish matches to â€˜winâ€™ random war spoils  Thereâ€™s no logic or pattern to what you getwhen you get it or how many get  For instance after one 20 minute game I won two war spoils and after one 1 hour game I got none  Plus you can get repeats like trading cards except you canâ€™t trade them with anyone  So intel bulletins and commanders are classified as commonscarce and rare  The rare types being the more useful and more powerfulI want the special commanderscanâ€™t I download them?  Yes you canat a price through that store page accessed via the game  Now Iâ€™m not saying that anyone would buy all the commandersor that you would even need toespecially as many just have different combinations of the same abilities  But just say youâ€™re a completestwell there are: 1 x starter bundle of four commanders at Â£6498 commanders at Â£279/each8 commanders at Â£299/each and 10 commanders at Â£199/each  Total cost = Â£7263noyou can also alter the cosmetic appearance of the game with vehicle skins (different camouflage paint jobs) and for a full set you need three (one for light vehiclesone for medium and one for heavy)  Now Iâ€™m not big on paying for cosmetic changes but just say you wanted to as they were there and you wanted them all  There are two starter packs (one Soviet and one German) at Â£479/each  There are then a whopping 40 extra skins at Â£159/each  Total cost = Â£7318yes Â£18413!!!surely you wouldnâ€™t download all the cosmetic stuffjust what you want  This is truebut itâ€™s not the point  You have paid Â£2999 for a game that is missing fundamental aspects to make it playable in multiplayer and the only way to get it is to pay morea lot more  I would never part with my hard earned cash to buy commanders which should be in the game Iâ€™ve bought  In fact they are in the gameI just canâ€™t use them  Fix the war spoils systemreward players who are very good and very skilful with the better commandersdonâ€™t fleece us!stuff the gameplayit doesnâ€™t matterno game is worth Â£21412 (DLC cost plus base game costall full price) to access all of its featuresnot oneever!but please boycott paying for whatâ€™s in the game already  Donâ€™t buy the commanderseven those you really want or need  Â£299 may not sound like a lot but you can often buy a FULL game for that on a Steam offer  Youâ€™re paying to use a single special unit that the computer can use at will  It sucksOnce you buy the gameyou have to spend another $60 to play the other half of the game In fact its more like 3/4th of the game"
0,"After a lot of hours in the game i can saysometimes u really feel the battlethe play time from 10-30 minjust minor bugsIf you want to get BANNED for no reason play this game2 of my friends got banned for no reason at allthe funny thing about this that 1 of them stopped playing the game for a month and he still got bannedbut the other 1 spoke to the admins of the game and she replayed as follow: [ ChenshuToday at 6:02 PM u have been banned for hacking ]BIG PROGRESSION ISSUES Once you reach level 30- which happens very fast - You move from the newbie 1-29 matchmaking pool into the general matchmaking pool While that itself shouldn't be a big deal there are several problems which make this a complete brick wall for progressing your hero and soldiershaving much better gear and units The Gulf is huge - The units alone are so insanely more powerful than your own hero+Units that is virtually impossible to do anythingGenerallyI would say this game has a great potential and new ideas which worth trying and playingbut suddenly the matchmaking starts putting you with people which is 50+ levels higher than you! They come with very highly upgraded weaponry and units and you and your squad canâ€™t even scratch his paint!!!some of them have abilities can kill your full health character within 3 seconds and you canâ€™t do anything about it! Many people just picking these characters for meta playthey can easily wipe you squad and kill your character and you can`t even do anything except of running for every time you see these charactersyou will find less stuff and gears on the market and basically everything is hard to find comparing to other region servers They have added cross server matchmaking lately which is goodbut they didnâ€™t do it for the market which give all other servers players advantage over you in term of available resources and gears Moreoverif you have a friend playing in another server you can`t create a cross server party to play with him even with the cross server matchmakingbut theses issues is ruining every thing I have liked about this gameHi allI have been playing this game for more than 1000 hours and payed more than 500$ for itthen got banned for no reason and when I asked them for a reason and a proof for banning me they did not provide anything for it and ignored me If you want to get banned for no reason I recommend that you play this gameIf you like games like Dynasty Warrioru will like this gameu might be okay with this gameu might be able to enjoy this gameu'd be okay in this game)minimap and enemy movements Can't be salty to your teammates when u isolate your archers and they get trampled by cavalry from your flankis of course limited Focusing on territory and house should be on the late gamenot early because the late game is literally thousands of other players fighting for territory There are thousands of houses and big alliances consist of veteran players Of course a new house is not gonna stand a chance in territory war So don't go off crying and complaining about your 2 member house with only 46 hours of play time can't get a territory and expecting the game will compensate u with something It's literally real life politics when it comes to Territory War and Alliances and territory are the end game rewardswhy the hell are new players even bitching about this??unitsgear crafting Having knowledge on this early in the game will help save u from a lot of resources being wastedthis game is really heavy towards meta U need to know which units are meta at the moment and play those because everyone in the late game will do itthis game can fun at times and frustrating at times Some people might like itsome people might not like it Some people try hard to get good at the gamesome might just complain and blame on maxed out units without understand the game concept To each it's own I guess? And my last piece of advice is do your preliminary research on the game as it will enable u to enjoy the game more from the start and prevent u from being salty later onThe devs of this game never listened to the advice of the community and also ""Lock""delete all the discussion of the problembalance topicSome players and families take advantage of the territory fightThe devs never made a compensation or hotfix of their problemNew ZealandersAustralians and Americans tend to share the same online servers if there aren't dedicated NZ/AUS Servers; this game oddly enough doesn't seem to allow for that and instead forces NZ/AUS Players (Predominantly English speakers) to play on Asia/Pacific servers The irony is the AP Serverbased on its ping results is in the US anyway Alsoup until recently the game allowed South America and Asia Pacific players to play with one another But not NZ/AUS players with NA players THERE'S LITERALLY AN INTERNET CABLE CONNECTING NZ AND AUS TO CALIFORNIABeen playing since Feb 2021 and I'd say this game definitely deserves a thumbs up at this pointbut very annoying if you're just looking for a fair 15v15 match for funI gave it another shot and realise the depth and (somewhat) balanced gameplaythe game does extremely poorly at easing in new playersyour new player experience will be sh-ti just want my siege battle to be funwth is this?and I wasn't disappointed when I decided to try it one month later Now I'm happily discarding my green horses and other random sh-t Not a time waster at allI decided to invest energy into figuring it out by watching youtube vids But most of these seem unnecessarily convoluted and doesn't add value to what's great about this gameit really took me this long to properly learn and enjoy the first 2 weapons On the other handit's not like I can just grab a bunch of green weapon and armour and expect to do okay in matchmaking Everything is a grind herebut it's fun when you're finally therewhere the entire game economy forms a loop by itself and drains the in-game currency thru wear and tear This game has all of those elements but at least in my serverthere isn't an actual ""free market"" going on All the green tier resources and loot drops are salvaged or out-right discarded coz nobody is buying them (Or maybe all the wear and tear is going to the Winged hussars kits where a few dozen hardcore players are pouring tons of money in territory war -_-"")it's like playing two entirely different gameseach with its own funafter you grind your ass off till your gold tier and meta unitsI'm just grateful that no unit is exclusively p2wmaking this grind a minor inconvenienceI'd spend so much money on the cosmetics and spend my time ENJOYING the actual game Just look at dota 2 I might be wrong given that I wouldn't know the actual business model and the things this company has to deal with financially But one thing is for surethis whole grind-fest and convoluted things is not going to bring in new players quickly Or maybe that's their strategy so that their servers can keep up hahahaalso the skill points Watch some youtube guides and gameplay to see which you like Good news is that there isn't really a bad weapon to speak of I see all kinds of weapons being mvp of the matchiron cap swordsmenspear seargentyou'll see maybe 1 glaive0 nodachi and 0 poleaxe per team So that's the meta currently (Although there're few dual blades/short bow and even long swordi'd say that these fulfill a niche role for the team per game) This doesn't mean that these weapons sucki'm sure they're lots of fun too although I haven't tried them myself It just means that they currently suck for tournaments hahaThis game totally chinese If you dont want to get bannedjust make friend with the Chinese If you fight themdont trash talk They can talk shit about your countriesyour racebut in case you telling same thing to themboomyou get banned for 30 daysJust waiting for this game to blow up so that queue times get shorterIt's a good gamebut damn most chinese players are toxic AF They will bully and gang up on you if they dont get what they want I was on a team of Chinese Players on Strength In Numbersthey called me names and used artilleries on my troopsjust because i brought some ranged unitsGame is terribly unbalancedcasual matchmaking makes lvl 30 players (less than 5 hours of game) face lvl 300 playerswhich in a game shouldn't be that much of a problem except that it has MMORPG formula and that lvl 300 player three hits not only the new player but also his entire regimentnot pay to winSevere progression issue for new free playersat level 30 you start to enter the next tier of match making poolwhere you face off level 50+ opponents with fully decked out troops and equipmentwhile the game expects you to make do with the supplied lv10 equipment and troopsridiculous! This is a PVP gamesuch progression system creates a huge gap between opponents of the same class It is ok to make players choose between skill treesbut locking is just plain stupid Very bad ideawe are only humans and we can all understand that some might not want spend that amount of bronze per game just for repairs!same issue Ridiculous ' Max durability ' system You will always be farming for bronze and silver JUST TO REPAIR and ' RECONDITION ' your set pieceYes you can ' Recondition ' a piece of equipmentat lower cost than the crafting requirement to make it as good as newbut does that really solve the problem? You're literally stuck at doing thiseven after getting a full set of equipment you likeand by the time you farm for enough materials to ' RECONDITION  ' that 1 pieceyour next piece is already unusable and needs to be ' RECONDITIONED 'or if they faila heavy price to pay A very vicious cycle really It's a gambling game alreadyand they exploit this They know what you thinkhow you thinkand they entice you by selling you cash troops which are free of repair cost Very schemingand when everyone enjoys the game they playthey are more likely to invest into the premium benefits that the game offers Win - WinI dont know why there are so many bad reviews But this game is awesome Playing from AustraliaIts a really good game in terms of gameplay It does not have too high requirementshousesminesetc BUT there is absolutely no point if you are new Literally all the territories on the (MASSIVE) map are owned predominantly my 3-5 major houses which makes it impossible for new players or houses to do anything These houses have extremely high level players you don't stand a chance against whatsoever because of them having significantly better gear and maxed out troops Its really sad that such a wonderful mechanic is beyond a significant amount of playerbase because of such cartelisation where you have to join these houses or make an alliance with them or else you dont stand a chancethe combat mechanicsabilitiesgame modes are reallyreally interesting and fun to playalbeit you get matched with a similar player level (which is very rare) and not extremely high player levelsGreat game  Bad serverTotal War + For Honor - The Priceyou would see T-posing teammates or Invisible Cavalry which are extremely rareYou can get all the strongest units and items through playing the game normally Yes you can use real money to speed up this process which first of allliterally all games allow to you use real money to speed up grindy processesand second there are no other P2W aspects in Conqueror's BladeOverall a decent game but the Chinese players are rude and when they do type/speak in english its usually insults"
1,"I'm going to recommend this game but I'm doing so very reluctantly Last night was the last time I logged in because I decided to quit the game after playing for around 15 monthsto anyone reading thisAlbion Online is a game made around PvP PvP is its heart no matter what anyone else gonna tell you Even if you want to steer clear from PvP and focus only on gathering/refining/crafting you STILL have to deal with PvP in terms of gankersI took whichever path I thought was the safest 10+ gankers showed up out of nowhere and melted my mount (T6 Ox) within second and killed me My gear and my loot was worth around 15m silver (for anyone playing the game for around 15 monthsthat's a big amount of silver) It was dishearteningI was quite annoyed at first but a few hours later I left it behind meon a daily basis I gather my herbs and then craft potion Afterward I would move to a Royal City to sell my potion I gathered my herd I crafted my potion I was on my way to the royal city Once moretook what I thought was going to be a safe route (againnot the same everyday) When I was literally a few feet from the entrance of a safe zone10+ people showed up from nowhere again and ganked me Effectively looting me from another 15m silver worth of equipment and potionI was completely crushed Nowwhile I lost 3m silver and for most people who are just starting out it would be a huge lost for me it was a huge lost which I knew I could come back from From day 1 of playing this game I've been super optimal in what I do and would always look for the best way to invest my silver to build a steady stream of revenue I knew the lost silver probably represent 5% - 6% of what I'd possibly make in one month or even less if I scale the stuff I do BUT I just don't want to deal with this anymore The negative feeling I got in that momentthe mood shifting from happy crafter to depressed because of a silly game and virtual currency Nahthis is not for meI don't want to deal with thatyou're probably safe Against 2it could be hectic if your mount is weak Against 3the chance of escape starts to become slim but its there Against 4you might get super lucky (or they're awfully dumb as a rock) Against 5? Against TEN? Nahjust stand there and accept your fatewhat you're paying the scout might negate any revenue you'd make gathering early onits just part of the cycle My wall of text is not a big sign telling you to go backits just a stern warning of what you're getting intoyou're gonna find a great amount of joy in this game People who wants to steer clear from PvP? You can't Full stopI'm still giving this a recommend because the game is good The system works as intended Just keep in mind that PvP is the core of this game and there's no escaping from thisThis game is great Its a hardcore runescape Then you learn that the entire game is only playable in pvp zones in the late game Then you learn that the game is only filled with ganking people Any time you go into these zonesyou run into players with far higher gear that is impossible to fight and they brought their friends too If there was a way to play the game in pve with my friendsI would I left a while back because everyone of my friends left the game for this reason (8 people) With no people to interact with beyond killing me on siteits pointless I wish we could play the game without lossing hours worth of grinding in less than 30 seconds There is my ReviewAlbion is one of the most polarising games which i played I read good and bad reviews about the gameThe game is REALLY FUNi admit iti love the FREEDOM you have when you end the tutorialthe SIMPLE and GREAT visual design/ ANIMATION reminds me old but great classic RPG gamesand you can do whatever combination of equipment is awesome BUT  you will realize soon how frustrant is trying to get better gear without getting gank and the toxicity inside of the gamebecause yeathis game have a strong PvP based and it's OKactually i love the PvP implemetationeven more the Arenasso i dont mindbut not everyone have 20-50 guild members/ friends to cover/ protect you meanwhile you are doing some dungeons spending your time collecting/ looting just to get killed by 7+ people  who the only objective is that on the game stealing everythingmaking the game more like a ''PSYCHO-AMBUSH-BULLY SIMULATOR'' more than a RPG with tons of freedomALSO there's just 1 SERVER FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD located in US in a PvP FOCUSED GAME Where MILISECONDS MATTER lucky for the ones who lives in US i guessand i knowi know there's people who the game runs without lag even outside of US but that's doesn't mean there's not people with lag problems out thereeven more if you live in another country Sad my relation with the game will end like thisbecause i like it honestly but as i said not everyone have tons of friends or time to coordinate to cover you when you do your stuff and avoid get steal (Killed)some people just wanna enjoy the PvE content alone or with friends or gather their stuff in peacei think if they create another continent just for doing full PvE content full blue zone and leave the black zone for those's people with big guilds/ people who want to do full ''PvP-Ambush'' stuff then great but right now as i said is a great RPG untill you end the tutorial and reach T4/T5 set and you need to start to get in ''killeable areas'' to continue progressing and then you realize how toxic start to be the peoplethe creativity of people to do bad things and how SCREWED you are if you are just a solo random person who want to pass a great time ingame well it transforms to be a GREAT and FREEDOM/ SIMPLE RPG build class to: BULLY TOXIC TACTICS SIMULATOR 1 server lag edition GoTY Sad it ends like that RegardsAfter the tutorialI played for a good 3 hours or something and immediately I get greeted by some guild that won't leave me aloneto then realize you could've just bought it for cheap on the marketvery immersive 11/10[/b]The game is fun on paperbut I don't love it in practicewhich is fine if you live in the United Statesbut it can become unplayable if you live anywhere else in the worldyou need to have many people to play with  After the initial first zonesthe game becomes open to any PvP  After some ""safe"" PvP zonesshould you continue to progressyou will be put into PvP zones where dying makes you drop everything (including your equipment)  As you can imagineyou can't last long in these zones without witnessing a bloodbathan atmosphere where everyone must work together would make you think that it would be easy to find a helpful communityright?  Wellno  The friendliest guilds I've seen have strict requirements before you're permitted entry  Honestlyas a solo playerI could never meet those requirements  The last straw for me was when I finally joined a guild that I thought was helping me out  I worked hard in my profession to gather up a decent amount of money to contribute to my guild as a whole and then I got kicked  It turned out my friendly ""startup"" guild was a scam to get me to donate resourcesand scam guilds are a lot more common than you'd like to believebut the community is toxic  Unless you get luckyor are introduced by a friend who has already settled in somewhere decentyou probably won't make it  I used to think that determination was going to get me ahead of the curveor at least out of this early game slump  It mightbut I've gotten to the point where my efforts are only exploited for other players' gainand after weeks of work I never come out with anything to show for itdon't get me wrong  I love sandbox MMOs  This one just has too much of an emphasis on zerg guilds  There is no reason to be a part of a community that is anything less than ginormous  This isn't for megood for you  None of my friends stayedand after wasting another several weeks trying to make it work for myselfI had to throw in the towel as well  Just rememberif you become the one that scams new playersor the one that groups up in PvP zones just to gank people who don't even have the gear to beat you in a 1v1 in the first placeyou've become part of the problemFounder Since Beta 1aka the glory daysnested portal dungeonsharbor townsblack zone citiesetc really hurt the direction of the game IMO SBI became obsessed with their consensual/non-consensual pvp and forgot to focus on developing their sandbox elementsand gaining a negative rep has no redeemable qualities It takes weeksif not months to reverse what rep damage you can do in a single day They had an opportunity to create pirate cities where criminals had to spawn and live out of and form their own ecosystem A bounty systemif developed correctly could add meaning to the reputation systemand now it's gone for better or worseWARNING: IF YOU ARE PVE PLAYER WHO HATES ANY PVP WITH PASSIONTHIS GAME IS NOT FOR YOUso be warnedyou may not enjoy high pinglagg and rubber banding which given that Albion online is full loot pvp game may ruin it for yousince all of the above are out of the waywe can discuss this awesome game Yesits grindy as hellone can grind till the end of time and then some more Even one of my friendswho really enjoys grindingcould not withstand the grindbut to be fairits one of the charming aspects of this game No matters whats happened to youyou can always return to safe zones and grind for some resourcesclear some dungeons and make some quick back to fund your pvp exploits As a player driven economy always will need resourceseven low level tierhigh revardbut how long before you will look for better hunting grounds? Full loot pvp sounds scarier then it is As every veteran player will tell youdon't go in red/black zones with gear which you can't afford to lose As game have been designedyou can craft or buy lower tier( T4/1 T4/2) and still make some runs in to the abyss There has to be a good balance of skill/gear and knowing when to/not to fight And its also possible to run awayeven so I managed to farmdo solo dungeons Even sostand one against 2 and surviveor help another when he get ganked Its all about earning more then loosing One successful dungeon run in black zone may be enough to cover 10 bad ones One successful farming session in red may cover 10 failed oneswhich I would say is entry lvl gear for pvp zones So each weapon category has different skillssame with armor and one can quite fast find things what works for him Even bettermaster a lot of them and you can switch around for whatever task you gonna do (farming/pve/pvp)yes its grindybut no matter what path you will chooseyou will always feel growing and progressing Yes there will be bad dayswith sorrow and lost fortunebut that only will make good days feel better It may feel like other jobmore so if you have premiumbut there is no another game like this(Yet)After so many hours i can say i know the gameplayersDEVsmany ways Let's use their text:no restrictions:others you will not even remember the namesOklet me start with this: if you want to PvEdo NOT pick this game up! Most PvE content is really boringand the fun stuff (the Avalonian stuff) is all in full-loot PvP areas infested with people who want your gearruining the fun of PvE I wouldn't give a thumbs down for this thosince the game is not really focused on PvE (although there would be potential for that tooreal shame for it)but it works well Now the bad part comes: there's no fun in it Absolutely none Since the game is PvP focusedif a build with a unique idea comes upyou can bet your soul it's gonna be nerfed or deleted Forget your creativity if you're trying to make buildsjust follow the metacause the developers are actively working against interesting builds This is one of the reasons I'm giving the thumbs down I love theorycraftingbut honestlyonly the open world PvP is worth mentioningas the others (1v12v25v5 hellgates or arenas) are decentbut there are games that focus on these types of matches and are a lot better at it If you think these gamemodes are funjust pick up a MOBA or a brawler (LeagueDota2SMITEBattleriteetc)they have better fleshed out gameplay and are fairnot gear-dependent WellI guess I can recommend it if you want a watered-down MOBA that you can pay and grind to win Not saying there's no skill involvedthere definitely isjust not as much as other gamessmall-scale open-world PvP is fun if you're a griefer That's it It's all about ruining other people's fun You go in with better gear  and more peopleyou win And then comes someone with even better gear or more people and wins This game allows griefers to grief to their hearts contents It's all about the big fish chasing the small fish Occasionally there can be some fun fights that are undecided until the endbut these are raritiesthis game shines when it comes to large-scale open-world PvP When it's happeningit's fun But there's a catch It  takes preparation to assemble the partiesto make sure the party's gear is metaand to physically get to the place of the war It can be hours And then there's the fact that the zones have player limitsso not everyone can fight at the same timesome will wait outside the zone until some space is freed up and while the fights can last quite a long timeunless you're the commanderyour part might actually be over in mere minutesand then you can spend 5 to 30 minutes getting back And if this wasn't enoughfights not always happen in factusually the team with less people will scout out the enemyand decide to retreat So both teams just spent that time preparing for a huge nothing This is Albion Onlinea game where you spend more time trying to find the content than actually doing the contentthat needs grinding before actually being profitable You can't customize gearso there's no point in handcrafted itemsand the prices on the market are fairSo if you're not in it for the moneycrafting is pointless And for the fun factorgathering is basically just running around the mapclicking on a resourceand waiting for it to gather Crafting is checking the market for what is worth craftingand then clicking a button to mass-craft an itembut not anything amazing Searching for loopholes in the market and abusing it until the prices normalize can be quite amusing I had fun with it for a while but it's not really my thingI'd rather fight This game is a sandbox MMORPGand not a market simso I'm not gonna recommend it just for good tradingthis game has politicswhich includes alliancesmarket controlarea controlbribestaxfees for servicesand fights for territories It's a lot like real-life politics That ain't a good thing Basicallyimagine real life politicsbut now instead of needing charisma and moneyyou only need charisma to be a leaderso the leaders are charismatic idiots with hundred times the ego of a normal person most of the time Alsothere are no consequences for doing something morally questionablebecause it's a game Sounds fun right? That's Albion politics in a nutshelland since it's full-lootyou're gonna lose that gear over and over again So you need that money over and over again Everyone wants money Nobody wants to lose gear Everyone wants to get your gear This means that people don't take fights that are not clearly in their favor Which results in PvP being stomped or being the stomper This is not healthy for a game where fun is the whole point But that leads me to my final pointand more and more about getting in game money for that premium (which can be purchased for in game money)for better gear so you can be the stomperfor investing so you can make more moneyetc Thankfully I realized this before I spent too much time just grinding moneyand after that I spent my money on just having fun And while the content in the game is fun for a short while if you have the moneyit gets boring And of course you can't really do PvE for fun because of the gankers so that's that After trying to enjoy the gameI ended up deleting itbecause it just wasn't that fun And to this daythis is probably the only game I regret spending a bunch of time on I feel like it was a waste While I miss what this game could have been with a better community and less of a focus on moneyI do NOT miss what the game IS one bit Good riddance Somehow this game managed to create gameplay out of grinding for money for the sake of grinding for moneyand most players fall for itmyself includedand I repeatthe ONLY reason you should pick up this game (besides griefing) is if you want to be a part of a big group And by that I mean 10+ (or heck even 100+) players playing together at the same timein a big discord call Having fun as a big group is the only thing this game is good atYou will notice a large amount of people posting negative reviews are the ones who complain the game is too unforgiving They'll say it's unpleasant dying to groups larger than themand how if they can't play solothe game therefore suckseverything you're wearing and anything in your inventory is dropped or trashed It's written on the doorway outsideif you don't like it don't play it If I'm allergic to fishI'm not gonna go to a seafood restaurant and order troutthen post a bad google review saying it almost killed mewhich is the strongest aspect of the game PvE leaves quite a bit to be desiredbut in the end it's all used to get stronger for PvP Groups can literally gank you inside a dungeon/raid and lay waste to you It's called divingand it's awesome Totally possible to fight back and win as wellit happens all the time If you are not someone who enjoys plentiful amounts of consensual / non- consensual PvPthis is not the game for youkeep looking elsewherebut this game as well as other MMOs are designed specifically to play with other people Playing solo in this game is definitely possiblebut it takes a great amount of patience and practiceas well as a deep understanding of gear interactions and game mechanics These are things you'll learn if you just join a damn guild Don't be scared to be social in an MMOthere are plenty of great guilds out there for beginners and veterans alike Start in a guild at leastthere are so many people willing to help newer players even in competitive high-stakes games like Albion Some guy posted a review saying most guilds require you to pay them to get in????? I've never seen this in my almost 2k hoursbut maybe I haven't looked at enough trash/scam guildsthe game is great For meI could never get into theme-park MMOs I played Rust since legacyand dabbled a bit in EVE online I also played a lot of league back in the day I like to think I've grown since thenbut I digress If you really want to compare Albion to anything elseit should be those three games Take the full loot adrenaline based gameplay from Rustuse the moment to moment gameplay from league (isometric6 ability action combat w/ 2 consumables)and then take the economy aspect from EVE Everything is player crafted and bought and sold on separate auction houses across the game world Why separate? Why not OSRS Grand exchange style? Some continents/zones give only certain resourcesand the cities near them give refining bonuses to mats found far away This creates incentives to move around and find arbitrage opportunities You can purely play economic PvP in this game if you want Transporting goods is a very lucrative activityand therefore ganking those goods is just as lucrative The game is also a sandboxso players more or less make the content for themselves If you log on every day expecting organized groups for ganking/roaming/gathering/PvE in your guildit might not work out so well Try being a leader and being the change you want to see if no one is running a group It won't be easyyou might get your friends killed a couple timesbut you gotta learn somehow Everyone starts at the bottomand the only thing separating the good players from the bad are the ones who stick through the rough stuff and keep working at itif you're considering the same activitythen yes But there is large scale PvP/PvE in Albion and there is small scale There is catching/gankingthere is escaping those people There is gatheringthere is solo play Most weapons and armor are only good at one or two of those thingsso what you end up with is a different sort of meta based on your group size There's enough variation and frequent balance passes to address absolutely useless items as wellwhich results in these metas shifting sometimespeople keep gang fucking me!"": Join a guildgo ganking with themsee how it's done Then you'll know how to avoid it There are plenty of gatherers that go without being killed gathering for months at a time PersonallyI've never been ganked while gathering T8 hides I don't do it too often to be fairbut when I do I make sure I'm wearing proper escape gear and that I'm farming near safe territoriesand you can buy gold with it on the in-game gold market Gold is used to buy premium (gives more fame/exppassive crafting pointsetc) as well as cosmeticsof which you can disable in the PvP zones if you want Personally I've always been able to pay my monthly premium with silverand I've been playing since steam release On the note of people paying for gear with IRL moneyIn realitythe people who swipe their credit cards for gucci gear are way too afraid to leave the safe zones  (almost negligible fameyou will never progress here) When they dopeople see that they're juiced and pile on like a bunch of coked out hyenas It's an amazing system If you try to P2W in this gameI can almost guarantee you'll end up making someone else rich You need mechanical skill and experience to truly be successful in PvPgear quality only helps up to a pointand they've shown it time and time againwith the icing on the cake being this most recent update There's too much for me to put into this reviewbut know this: they aren't going to give up on this game anytime soonand it's slowly becoming more populated This is nothing short of a marvel for MMOs today Most start strong and fade quicklybut not here I have great faith in this game and the developersand they have some great content coming down the pipe for the next updateand I'll personally take some time and answer questions for you that you may have Alternativelyif we're fullsend me a whisper in game @BeeRye I'd be happy to give you a handSo farAlbion isn't really a newbie-friendly gamebut once you get some levels and experience upyou'll get the game to its full potentialto large 100 people zerg vs zergshuge guildsand plenty of things to do as a groupbut your quest is mainly to be the richest (i guess?)but really cool for melots of things to do even if you're not upgraded to premiummeaning you can go any characterany buildanytime you wantas I previously mentionedwhich makes the game alot more exciting and challengingusually just spend $10 on 1 month of premium or even just earn ingame currency to get your first month of premiumterritoriescastlesetcfarmsetcwith a mix of some Dota 2it's really grindy to get higher tier items and rare stufftook me a decent week to max out my gathering skillinflation of items are inevitablelots of players are shit and raises the tax to 999% in crafting stationsand most of the stations in major cities are owned by players and large guildsas a solo player myselfit's really fucking bad to play this game alone With full loot PvP in the open worldyou'll always go against 3 people or moreguilds own most of the territory and would instantly kill anyone they meet that aren't their teammateswhich is NA As a SEA playerand the vast majority of the players from EUit brings lots of us in a disadvantageespecially in PvPunless you got a group of some sortnot good for people with low-end PCs even if it has Dota 2 graphicslarge scale full-loot pvpplayer driven economy with lots of unfair taxes and prices but mostly normalyou can be any class or equip any item at any timeyet it feels really nostalgic Lots of frame and ping lagespecially if you're in SEA or EU or any other place other than NA But a really good game so fareven as a sandboxit feels like you always have something to doMy steps in Albion Online - Tutorial phasebut did not want to before trying out the gameI logged inI picked a starter city Oh I got disconnected four times during the tutorial Each time it took over an hour to log back in So to finish the 45 ish minute tutorial took me 4+ hours because of the disconnects and queuebut give nothing So they get your hard earned moneybut give nothing in return As a new playermake sure to not join one that charges more than 5% I was in one that charged 50% because they promised gear once I get to T4 - which they did not deliverthey take your money With all the lag and stutterit is easy to click on yes by accidentyou need to be a subscriberbut the developer seems to be fixing things I am now always less than 5000 in line and it takes about 20-40 minutesbut whateverso I lose everything except my silver I get more gear and go find some solo noob exploring and treasure hunting I kill him and end up looting treasures worth a few hundred thousand silversafer wayand try to avoid gankersbut eventually I made enough silver to buy the premium subscription! Yesyou can use the in game currency to get premium I am now not at all affected by the terrible queue system I also decided to throw the developers some money and bought the new player starter packcraftingbreedingand fishing Love the game so farbut you should give it a few weeks to calm down and improve Other than the tax issue I mentionedthe developers seem to be competent and listen to playersbut with much better graphicsbut supposedly that's coming down the line The current solo dungeons are quite boringand melee classes have issues with thempreferably an archer or nature staff userI would say a 7/10 If they also fix the tax exploiters targeting new playersI would easily bump it up to an 8/10Great game But there's a couple of things that are game-breaking for meor EU But for anyone playing from SEAI wouldn't recommend itand its not filled with micro-transactionsthis and that event to make you pay for contentdlcspremium only content etcgood PVE contentbut I just take that into account and adjust my strategyothers will hate it Personally I don't mind itneither good nor bad Even though I'm more of a solo player this hasn't affected me too badlyif you don't its still completely doable I don't mind the grind because there's a lot of fun elements to itbut some players hate itthe combat is slow paced and players with high ping can still keep upI guess the peak times for EU and NAits just completely unplayableyou will be drawn back dozens of timesyou will have enemies teleporting aroundyou'll fly back into enemy abilitiesyou'll get kicked to the main menu and reconnected dozens of times etcor will it? Wellfor someone who spends most of their time solo in the black zonesit actually willa logout timer will start counting down I've seen it start at 60 seconds and go downand I've seen it start at 300 seconds Both of which are ridiculously high8-15 seconds are more than enough to kill a player trying to run from a fight using a disconnect Hes afkcant defend himself and just stands there taking damagefree for anyone to just stroll up kill me and get lootonly to find I have been knocked out 4-6 times in a row by the mobs I was fighting while I got disconnected I stood upI got knocked outwaited 18 secondsstood up againknocked down again 4-6 times That's ridiculous One time? Sure But at some point you got to just log the player outwhere the devs know and admitted themselves there would be a portion of players suffering from connectivity issuesthis clearly has not been thought through at allit's happened to me a lot Sure its a bit unforgiving but overall it's still quite funand I'm not left feeling bitter after I lose a fighteven if it was an unfair fight like 4-5 vs 1 It's finethats how the game goes But I'm sure that the above is not exactly meant to happen and it certainly doesnt make for a fun experience when your progress is just wiped out because the laggy servers dropped you Not coolThis game is plagued by huge guilds/alliances that monopolize territories to the point where you can't farm or gather the higher tier resources without the threat of being ganked Imagine being a skinner (Like myself) You go out to the black zone and skin for 30-45 mins until your Pork Pie is upand you head back with you 200-300 + hides and run into a group gankers that kill you All that work wasted and now you have to buy a new set of skinning geara new weapon AND a new mount The game is incredibly unforgiving OH and these giant said guild/alliances will more often than not CHARGE you a fee if you want to join I have over 401 hours in on this gameup to t8 skinning and am just over the constant anxiety of being killed while I'm trying to have funIf you like PvPlooting people you killplayer driven economies and Moba style combatyou will like this gameyou won't like this gameFelt punishing for new playersbut most content in the game is pvp centered sooo Yeahthere are lots of content to learn and experience Although I would say that it's really hard to progress into high tier play because you can literally lose everything you got on your character(equiplootetc) just by being at the wrong place at the wrong time You are heavily reliant on a guild if you wanna progress beyond the cities starting zonesbut only to a certain extent and seems like it's not intended or encouraged to do so by game designbut if I was asked to recommend this game I wouldn't You definitely will have a lot of bitter experiences and most of time you have no idea what you are doing because the game just dosen't explain the hows and whys very welljust sharing my experience of it and at least give it a try before making your own judgementbut I quickly found out that endgame is poorly explained(actually not explained at all) and unless you are in a active high-end guild that is willing to help their newer players endgame content will only be a low-reward high-risk for youSowhat to expect from this game?or just hold the left/right mouse button) can be frustrating because of the fixed angle and limited zoom option whereas the map is quite big (THIS SUCKS EVEN MORE!!)you can expect big profit loss even after you gathered for hoursto get your own island which only costs 170 K silver (But it's worth itand you only have to pay for it once) just get ready to farm for quite some timethat's that from methanks for reading my review!SHOO! Don't waste your time herejust trust meAlbion's core gameplay is fine Howeverthe way some mechanics are implemented are not I'll go by an comparison to Black Desert Onlineworld bosses spawn the same at set locationswith public timers This is same for both games Howeverthe major difference here iseven though both games are primarily focused at PVPBDO forces you to flag for PVP before engagingeven at world bosses This makes it so that even solo characters are able to get some rewards from the boss itself In Albionhoweveryou're automatically flagged for PVP whenever you try to ""contest"" any given world event This in and of itselfis not a bad mechanic Howeverwith the way the community is shaped right nowunless you're a part of a big allianceyou won't even be able to attend to the event arealet alone to the event itself In my 164 hours of playtime with a group of friendswe've never been able to seelet alone doa world boss up close Big alliances with 200-300 active members with gear that you could only dream of will raid the event areaknock down ""or kill depending on the area"" anyone that approaches There is only so much you can do when you're outnumbered hundred to one This is the only thing that I could say is a problem that is put there by the developersthe community itself Oh boy It boils my piss whenever I think of the encounters I haddieand complain about the tank failing their role Tanks will try to focus on their damage before survivability You will get flamed for playing your role properly You will get flamed more for not playing your role properly You will get flamed in the arena for not being able to win a 2v3 while that piece of shid guy who flamed you managed to lose a 2v1 You will get flamed in multiple languages Your party member which you wiped the whole dungeon with will quit the party the very last secondinteract with the ch"
1,"My pedigree: ~500 hours Shogun 2 (+Darthmod)~300 hours Warhammer 1mostly played Very Hardand generally volume wins However there is the notable shake-up of:for better or worse Strong 1v1 generals will win battlesperiod Dueling and killing generals will crush morale and cheese fights just like targeted damage spam from Warhammer The AI is quick to accept and propose duels it cannot winand even when they reject them you can simply right-click on them and get the same result So far I have not seen any troops be effective against high-stat generals â€” it's common to outmaneuver an invasion using your garrison troops to route the enemy only to have their general stick around and solo your remaining squadswhich I haven't tried yetthere are more units than reviews insinuated Most of these are gated behind general archetypes and technology I can see these units substantially affecting the outcome of fights if you can afford them An example: auto-crossbow units from high-Cunning generals will grant you a highly cost-effective ranged unit at the expense of a very weak general This might be a good choice for a defensive army that has walls to garrisonanother 25 for winter (even in your own territory) Once your supplies hit zero you suffer massive attrition losses This can be improved with infrastructure and character traitsbut without significant investments the net effect is that distant campaigns and prolonged sieges are extremely high-risk Aside from conquering armies and settlements there are no effective ways of replenishing your supplies during an invasion Thiscombined with the very slow replenishment of supplies and mustering of replacementsforces you to be very deliberate with your aggression and defense Gone are the days of spamming Ashigaru to handle an unexpected attackor endlessly raiding a territory while waiting for reinforcements Likewise the AI can't use these strategiessolving the cat-and-mouse games everyone hated in Warhammerrequiring lots of forethoughteach replete with collateral effects and synergies that make you consider the province as a whole rather than the usual one-problem-one-building method we're used to Compounding this is the commanderies system â€” known as provinces in Warhammerthese are groups of territories that are designed to be held together One territory of a commandery will contain the city and most of the buildingswhile attached territories will contain an exclusive building tree Because building synergies are so powerful you are highly incentivized to own an entire commandery instead of mere parts This adds more intrigue to expansionist aggression as well as the excellent diplomacy system â€” with good relations the AI will gladly trade territories of equal value with youbut it is also important to hire personalities who satisfy the needs of your economy (vanguards are better for industrycommanders for peasantsetc) Black sheep can still be effective so long as they're kept away from their associates Failing to satisfy them can have heavy consequences â€” people with significant power in your government can even start a civil war In my first run I found myself occasionally firing people I hired with insufficient foresight to avoid showering them in promotions or letting tensions boil overoften having served other leaders before you This mostly has implications with Espionage which I'm not experienced enough to talk about yetrefusing trade and breaking alliances randomly In Warhammer diplomacy was hardly possible at all From that low bar 3K has made massive improvements Leaders are generally more reasonable and fit their ascribed personalities well Diplomatic intrigue has so far satisfied me more than any Total War or 4xbut you will find yourself taking advantage of them more often Itemspaymentsand marriages can be used to appease leaders into treaties and trade agreementsand territories can be traded to mutual benefit Enemies can be effectively extorted when their backs are against the wall Cao Cao can stir the pot with the ability to start proxy warsas new members must be approved by a majority of existing onesand voting in opposition of members will sour your relations Furthermore people will not be interested in joining if your confederation is weak That means order is importantand you will want to confederate with the most widely liked and powerful factions first All of this complicates your expansionismperhaps forcing you to take risks on distant campaigns rather than upset an allyor an ally's-allyby attacking your bordersbuy one The more battles you have the more time you'll spend loading I've been enjoying 5 second loads on my M2which largely devolved into paint-by-numbers spamfests Controlled growth is keyand many decisions will require you to think several turns ahead If you're playing Total War with an emphasis on battles with diverse armies and lots of spectacle you will be more at home in Warhammerbut hardcore strategists will love this gameI am a Chinese player and this is my first comment on steambecause you cannot find any historical mistakethe Chinese voice actors are excellentI recoginised that the voice actor of Zhengjiang (éƒ‘å§œ) is also for Sylvanas in WOW :)As a long time Total War fanI wasn't looking forward to this one  I have no interest in the time period or location  My favorites in the series are rome 2 and the warhammer series  I decided to give three kingdoms a tryand now I don't think I can ever go back  It is so goodit makes every previous TW seem archaic  Specificallydiplomacy and the campaign side of things have been improved so much  The choices you make affect so much more with coalitionsalliancesand vassals  There is a lot more character developmentto the point that you care so much about your council membersfamily membersand allies  These individuals become intertwinedforcing you to really think about each negotiation  Indeedif you lose a general you care aboutyour other generals in battle will go berserk with rage if they have developed a good relationshipbattles play absolutely beautiful  I have engaged large battles as often as I can to really push my computers limit (i7 7700k16GB Ram1080 Duke video card) and I rarely get a noticable dropthe music is awesome  Whether it's when a battle is about to commence or during the battle itselfthe fanfare really draws you inand I can't recommend it enoughConquered half of China and declared myself the Emperor The remaining kingdoms united and declared war on me The war  was going in my favor in the beginningbut they just kept coming and then they slowly turned the tide of war Now they are deep in my territory and are laying siege on my capital right now They also killed my beloved son and heir to the throne 20/10 would get destroyed by petty kingdoms againA Total War game with great optomization I never thought i'd see the dayIf your on the fence as to whether to buy

Thank you!!!""maybe as a general or officerLetâ€™s hope all the detailed character focus and massively improved diplomacy lead to a Medieval 3Short Version: its fantastic go play it 9/10however not without tiny issues here and therethe production value is just a bit under Shogun 2 - despite the lack of cutscenes there is plenty to appreciate - the beautifully done technologic treethe musicthe soundsambientarchitecture - its very well donehowever this is achieved by 'cutting' from other places as a result you can get a whole lot of blurring even on 'ultra'- there are a lot of optionspersonally my favourite interactions are buying out provinces and selling crops I will never forget how i traded a bunch of rice and clay figurines for a marriage with legendary Lu Bu Agriculture/10they are very fieldable units that can and will do workmoreover i have found that absolute majority of units are very much fieldable with respective expertise areas Peasants still perform awfully BUT compared to Shogun 2's Ashigaru units they cost more and do morehave infinitely more morale but less usewhile she does have predisposition to raiding and pillaging you wont be doing that forever Also: unique unitsbut that RNG adds to the 'unique' nature of every runsemi randomised trees which set hard lvl cap to 15 Its a far cry from Rome2Shogun2Warhammer - its just shitty in every way outside of 'multiple things in one ability' Any time a hero is lvled up im not excited You pretty much dont get stats Best you can get is an ability on the field Or some passive buff for administrator/commander Thats about it Not excitingAt the time of this reviewI have completed seven separate campaignsand I'm in the process of doing my eighth with Yan Baihu I feel that I've played enough of TW3K to give an honest and informed opinion of the game Check my play history and you'll see that I'm a longtime Total War and strategy fanlook at Rome 2 That game is legitimately pretty decent now But reviews are about the current state of a gamenot my fondness for the series Three Kingdoms has been out for a year and a halfand it feels like I am playing an unfinished title I cannot speak for how the game played in previous iterations or even prior to the recent Nanman updatebut currently this game is not worth 60 USD or the 84% positive rating it has herefull-priced gameI expect at the very least an experience without game breaking bugs or issues which heavily affect my ability to literally play the game Is TW3K a fun game? Yes I don't play games which I don't find fun Is it a good game? Againyeahit's solid Not the best Total Warbut it could most definitely reach that status in a few years Sowhy the negative review? Simple; the game is unpolishedcrashes frequently (over two dozen times for me)poorly balancedand features several overpriced DLC that aren't even particularly goodenemy generals also disappear And not because of ambushes I'm talking a genuine bug that turns them invisible on the map and can completely screw up what you thought was an otherwise safe time to engage the enemy Combined with constant crashesmy 145 hours was honestly a chore sometimes to achieveTotal War has both never been better and never been worse Battles are fun Unique generals with personalities and rpg-lite elements make for an awesome emergent narrative experience Reminds me of Crusader Kings in a way Less deepbut very interesting The units look great and are a blast to use They've even color coded them basically by function Super convenient When things are goodthey're great But when they're badthey're terrible Units are woefully unbalanced Nanman factions have ridiculously strong units which can easily overpower Han factions early game Not fun at all when you have to spend the majority of a campaign holding off invasions from those guys Nanman asidethe Han units are also really poorly balanced Only a few units are actually viable late game and stacking your armies full of them will net you stupidly easy autoresolves should you wish it Tactics are especially atrocious on Romance modewhere generals are big baddies that fuck up everything in their path Granted you can play without this or understand that 3K is ultimately more like Warhammer than classic TWbut it shouldn't be so blatantly arcadeI like playing this game It's fun It has massive potential If it's on saleconsider it if you already know you love Total War games Full price? Not a chance And honestlynot a chance of me editing this review to positive until CA addresses issues that prevent a truly immersive experience free from frustrationI think by now I can safely say that this is the best Total War game I've ever playedheavily based off the 14th century novel about the time period It's absolutely beautifuland ancient china is as unique a setting as you can ask formeans that they can single handedly take on units of enemies This allows for an added element of epicness in your battles and feels really fresh and fun in battlethe ""duel"" system in which your general calls out another to engage in a 1v1 duel is some of the coolest stuff I've ever seenthe amount of options you have for engaging in diplomacy with another faction makes it feel fun and essential to a campaignrather than being a means to an endthe different factions that you can play as all have their own unique playstyles While you can play as one of the three main charactersyou can also play bandits which can act as mercenariestraders which incredible manipulations skillswarlords who are unmatched in battle (Lu Bu = Lu Bae) etcbut something about it just feels [b]right[/b] It's very satisfying to work your way up from a small lumber yard to an empireto factionsto campaignsit all feels very polished and at the peak of its potentialcavalryand infantryyou could have people in a city be extremely happy one turnand extremely angry in the next with the only indication being ""population""you're not given enough things to actually equip to your characters The chance of finding a weapon or armor that would actually benefit a character are maybe 4 times a playthroughbut the new additions fit right into the game If I had to describe this game in one sentenceit would be ""Total War meets Crusader Kings 2 meets ancient china with a sprinkle of Dynasty Warriors""Surprised I didn't have to pay $499 to write a reviewIn short words this might be one of the best Total War games to date It connects good battles with many deep campaign mechanics that TW:Warhammer games are lacking I'm not fan of the setting and I was very sceptical about this titlebut since I bought itit grew on mewhich differ a bit Romance mod is the main with powerfulsingle entity heroes with abilities that can change the tide of battles Records mode nerf heroes a bitthey come with plenty of cavalry bodyguardsmore experienced your hero islarger bodyguards he have Also you can equip all your heroes with weaponsarmorsmountsancilliaries and followers which will make them appear different on the battlefield and grant them unique bonuses and abilitiesbut AI does decent job trying to use their  missile unitsflank with cavalryprotect archers with infantry Rarely I see them doing something illogical or dumb Battle AI is much more improved from Warhammer where it was very passive so you could easily use all your ammunition to kill it Now it moves away from the walls inside the city when you have advantage in range unitswhen it notices that you have no ammo left AI comes backtrying to defend the gatesblocking any breakthroughs with unitsmaking it difficult to get inside Even if you break the first lineusually there is second line of troops trying to block the streetsthey spread more units to block other ways inside My onli gripe was that town garrisons are pretty smallsmaller than minor towns garrisonsso you need to build special bulding for more unitsbut I think its a small issue because mods for bigger garrisons or maybe official patch should make this rightthere are militia one available for every faction and generalthere are few faction unitseach faction have usually 2 of themthere are special units unlocked by tech tree (reforms) which are called Dragons There are Dragons with axesswordscavalryarchers each call differently Most interesting are Azure Dragonsglaive infantry with bows They have special formation where two first lines form up against cavalry charge and rest is sitting behind and shooting from safe It should be mentioned that each general can recruit to 6 units and you have 5 different types of generalshigher general rank better special units he can recruit For example strategist on level 3 can recruit medium crossbowmen and on level 6 heavy crossbowmen and sentinel can recruit special medium sword infantry You can have maximum three generals in one armybut he said ""no"" everytime? Not anymore Now you know exactly why they want peace or agreementsgame shows you how much points you need to make deal done For example if there is -50 when you are proposing peace it means you need to soften the deal with some cash If you crushed them in few battles the score might be +15that means you can order them to give you additional money or even force them into being your vassal There is also a great option with quick deal You click it and choose ""trade agreement"" and you see all guys who may want to trade with you It even says ""maybe"" or ""yes"" that means you need to offer those guys that are not convinced few things in returnbut if you have food surplus you might sell it to other lords for money or agreements If you have plenty of farmsbut not many high income regions you can get a lot of gold just from food distribution Population is coming backbigger the town isthe more people it can sustain and it gives bonuses to income and replenishment You need to upgrade your town to get more building slots and higher population capbut there is only few dozen of them When you play and recruit more they almost always look very simillarwith same bad weapons and armorso in the lategame when some of your heroes die of old age the game is a bit less interestingbut it helps that when you reach King rank three Kingdoms are formedleaders became Emperors and you need the other 2 of them to abdicate or conquer their emperor seat which is in their capital Its pretty interesting mechanic because Emperors still can make peace and trade agreements but cant ally with each other If you have a slower start it might happen that AI trigger the event and you wont even be one of the Emperors Then you need to capture one of the seats for you to become a pretenderbut nothing game breaking or annoying enough to make me stop playing Satisfaction mechanic and relations between characters should be more impactful Spy system is interesting and you can do amazing things with itbut your spies need a bit of luck to get hired by other factions to make it worthwhilepleasant for ears There are also cool options to choose fromlike changing colour palettes you can use Romance palette while playing in Records modeetc There are unit cards and alternative unit cardsenglish or chinese voiceovers with english subtitles Not everyone might like itbut characters do a bit trashtalking during battlessome lines are a bit cringebut I mostly like thembut it is probably the best release of CA game in the studio history Battles are goodcampaign is great and character focus is making this game a bit more interesting Few small patches and mods should make this a masterpieceIf you are not Chineseyou probably have a hard time imagining what Four Masterpieces mean to us When I was a childI used to read Romance of Three Kingdoms twice a year during holidays We were eager to experience that part of the history covered by the fog of war and politics via video games That was exactly the time when the art of war in ancient China has reached a whole new level During a very long timeour only options are games developed by KOEI Don't get me wrongtheir games are great (well at least some of them are) And you know what? You changed this situation Now if you ask a Chinese player what is the best game based on the history of three kingdomstheir answers are probably gonna switch to the Total War seriesI am so glad they ditched whatever system they were trying to put together in Thrones of Britannia This installation of Total War is absolutely phenomenal With a steep learning curve that is made pretty user-friendly via excellent tutorialthis game brings city managementcharacter managementand army builds to a whole new level There's a large gap between the 'kind' of game this and previous historical total warsbut this timeunlike ToBthat gap is perfectly executed and fine-tuned into a game that has removed my skepticism of future Total Wars all togetherCampaign AI plays by a different set of ruleswhich limits your options to outplay them For exampleyou can't destabilize your enemy's public order by going for their food production in a prolonged war Even a single city under siege manages positive food production and the upkeep necessary to maintain an army large enough to equal that of your 4 commanderies (regions)every timeis direct military confrontation Badcheating (as admitted by CA) AI ruins replay value and severely limits strategic depthIts has a much bigger map than normal total war gamesFamily tree)[h1]FIRST IMPRESSION[/h1]beautifuland well optimised""StarwarsWH40K would be absolutely fricking awesomeStarts Up Game: Selects Kong Rongthe siege of some of these towns are taking longer than I thoughtwaiting it out shouldn't hurt!he has signed a trade agreement with me as well as many deals in my favourgood!money is shrivelling up a bitI haven't encountered enough factions to really benefit from Kong Rong'scommerce is failing due to having only 1 trading port Good thing Liu Bei always gives me goodI still have only farms and fishing portsLiu Bei has taken all of the territoriesKong Rong is not supposed to be warlike therefore having many armiestherefore I only have my small army consisting of Kong Rongone Sentinal and one commanderI haveand he won't give me military access unless I give him all of the moneymy monopoly has grown massively and Liu Bei can now no longer offer me the crazy unfairwho is alsothis is great!

1,"Don't get fooled by the title because there is no playground for the people.murder peopleeveryone who bought this game is on a list[h1] THE BEST SANDBOX ON PC! [/h1]but decided to support the developers and buy the game on Steam.you can: [/u]honestly!please add more organsmore cold and firearms weapons and more things made of glass to the game. For example:bottle.so I wrote this review in a translator. Sorry for the mistakes.thank you very much for the commentsawards and ""likes""! You're cool!It's like an educational program gone wrongI like it.I installed the dream mod and find it so fun ruthlessly putting an end to his pathetic life.i should seek mental helpi can make dream walk into a mineyou have mental issuesthe more you play itthe better it truly getsviolenceThis is a perfect game for psychopathsthis is every kids dream game killing peoplehere is my honest opinionthe best sandbox game you could ever think of. But the community? Jesusitâ€™s as toxic as anyone can handleIf your good at making mods on the steam workshop you are going to get admin on the official discord server. And the discord? Godit is more toxic than the Chernobyl incident. Not only The staff are toxic But the whole community is immature and Just retarded in general. Donâ€™t believe me? join the server and Look at the mods talkI've never seen such immature staffthey're Making Yandere discord look like a joke. I got muted for Typing an original suggestion and it was the staff mistakethen when I argued about it they Insulted memade fun of me THEN asked me about my age. Anyone who has been on the internet for more than 3 seconds Knows that if I said my age I would get insulted to my age too! they asked in such a hostile way that Zooi himself had to unban methen later like 2 weeks later I posted One meme about Beirut explosion and instantly got banned even tho in the rules it says you will get muted first then banned and when I talked to the ""staff manager"" he said""we decided to keep Your ban"". No serious moderation at all. I recommend you buying this game But for god sake NEVER EVER get close to the discord or the forums because they all are as toxic as they can beDid not punish him what so everand when the Pressure was overwhelming he ""Deleted the server"" maybe he Just private everything so you cant see the chat. anyways Vincent was in like a gold mine because the server was filled with children either way. you guys can go and spread hate idc- Do you like hurting other people ?killYou can commit war crimes with no consequences 10/10My parents sent me to a therapist after seeing me play thisi should seek mental helpViolence : And Losing All SANITY              ( Btw i did not expect this to blow through the roof in just a few days soThank you!

1,"Kronii and bae bring me here don't aski'm gonna make porn of this game---{Gameplay}---you can have multiple builds for a character that you choose from and you path in game to get items for your build There's tons of items and path choices you can choose from that you can experiment and try new builds Also in gamethere's things such as consolesbushesall that so positioning is important There's also tons of tiny things like foodanimal drops and timersWickelinetrapsswitching gearmastery exp As of right nowthey are currently releasing new characters every 2 weeks or soso you'll always have some new variety to play with and experiment with Currently in NAthe ranked queue takes years to find games unless there's an event going on for ittry and find routes that line up with your teammates by zone 3 atleastfind plans that get your weapon by zone 2zone 3 is acceptablesome areas are nearby that might have the same items so if you don't find your itemyou can go there and get it)more people that kill youpaths and items being taken in your pathetc In Squads and Duosthere's some leeways like being knocked downhaving 1 or 2 more teammates to revive youteammates can get items for youmore safetyjust everything feels better I've had so many times where some areas are looted dry and other areas around it are dry as well and it feels so bad But by being in duos or squadsyou can have the safety of your teammates especially if you align your paths you can most likely kill anyone to get their itemsover and over again"" Adaptability in knowing where items are found in other zones is a huge part of counterplay in this game To methis game feels like a real-time card game where you ""deckbuild"" your route with efficient pathing then when in-game you execute your deckplaying around and knowing your opponents' (meta) routes (or decks) To methinking""Ohmy build fails mid-game because it 4-item spikes in zone 4 I should adjust my starting position"" is the same feeling as thinking""My deck fails mid-game because my mana curve is too stacked in the 5 mana area making my early curve suffer I think I'll adjust it after this match""the game strives in having a high mastery cap for a single character I can play a character for a hundred games straight and still think to myself after the game that I could improve some parts of my route or my build Just my two centsthis in term is like a ""deck size"" Do you want to pick up more lighters in your area for food later onor does your build take too many components early Maybe you'll grab that component in the next zone so you can make a bunch of surveillance cameras here It's a series of affordances you constantly have to play around with The game's balanced around item power in relation to route efficiency Maybe your build is super greedy and spikes at the third route with four or five gemstones You should adjust the build to take less contested items or know alternative routesThis game has broken my HARD moba addiction I used to play league of legendssmiteheroes of the stormdota 2all the mobas you could ever imagine every dayfor countless hoursconstantly hating myself after every win I was dissatisfied no matter the outcome With winsI was carried by teammateswith lossesI was held back by teammates I was angry But nowwith this gameI'm happier then I've ever been There's solosduostrioscustomizationa fun mastery system that keeps you engaged throughout the entire gameGonna update this in Decemberthe text below atm is from Mayi noticed this game around February2021it was around for 4+ months at that time It made me curious about it's gameplay formula with this MOBA/Battle Royale/isometric view mix and all those survival aspectscrafting and PvPyou can easily find it on google playstorethe devs diligently release a new char every 2 weekssome skins mixed here and there and do balance/bug fixes each weekbut i must do so due to reasons (explained below)[b]i must point out two THE MOST IMPORTANT things:[/b]there's absolutely no Pay-to-Win elements of any kinds[/b] and the only things that matters are: your own knowledge and player skill This game is similar to LoL (example)you play gamesearn account exp and ingame currency and then buy desired characters I will tell more about all methods of obtaining $ later in this reviewit's exactly as i saidlet me repeat - VERY UNFRIENDLYto the extremebut trust me - the end result and satisfaction from gameplay is worth ittutorial in this game is pretty bad It teaches you the absolute bare minimumbut it's not enoughlet's look at the first important gameplay aspect in this game - PLANSyou choose the gear that you plan (want) to build and then decide which route to take The already starts heresince you can choose any zone on the map as your starting point AND you can see HOW MANY enemies also want to start in each zone This means if there's way too many people start at the same zone as you -> you'l better have a backup plan or two By default you're allowed to have a 5 plans for one character and can increase it further by paying 1500 coins for 1 more Plan slotavoid recommended plans that involves many Legendary(orange) itemsthat are required these components to craft: Tree of LifeForce CoreMeteoriteVF Blood Those are rare components that you'l get from a PvE mob drops (very rare)timed map events (need to know timings/drop location and be there and prepared to fight) Get a basic knowledge of the game firstthen try to go for thosebecause in this game SKILL INFORMATION AND SCALING IS EXTREMELY LIMITING with explanation Often skills got some hollow comments like ""Slightly increase your movement speed"" Wtf is slightly? 10%? 30%?we're moving to phase two -> after picking up characterdesired plan(s) and route -> the game startswhile also collecting Food/Water items for HP/SP regen and killing some chickens if your build requires Animal Skin item drop Dont try to fight animals (other than Chickens) without Purple Weaponit will take a lot of time and HPso be aware of enemy in the same zone as youwhen the enemy craft an Orange/Purple weapon - you will be immediately notified on the minimap if that happened nearbygo along your planned routewhile collecting itemsslaying chickenswolvesbearsetc and level up your weapon mastery Weapon Mastery and Base level Pretty much everything in this game gives expeven moving from location to location and opening cratesthey are:Duo or Squad (3x)Duo or SquadRanked Duo/Squad is mostly alive only in Koreaother regions are pretty much Solo Ranked and even that one is not that fastbut it's kinda easy to farmabout 20x time faster than League Your main sources of income are:but gives a lot) channel or affiliated streamerswith all the gimmicksfeatureshidden mechanics and etc movesthen you gonna have a good time with the game If you love MOBAs in general or anime themefeel free to check this gameThe eternal in the name stands for the queue timesDefinitely worth a tryI'd love to see this game blow up2021 Edit: The game has improved so much It's getting ever more polished Highly recommend itbut it's exactly what I was looking for: A single player MOBAeternal queue time[h1]Categories that might interest you are underlined:[/h1]while the [u]movement and combat[/u] is like a less colorful but just as smooth League of Legends (with a bulkier UI) Impressive considering the [u]small game size[/u]you have more time to make decisions or make up for bad ones Or runthat often worksthey have a schedule for specific times of specific days when specific game modes are open [u]NA servers[/u] seem finebut I haven't had issues playing on NA I'm sure I haven't noticed lag often due to the slow pace of the gamebut I've also not felt lag at all most of the time My game has frozen due to high ping for a few seconds once every few gamesand on occasion it can take a second longer to open a container18 players) also makes the game flow much more appropriate They clearly weren't just copying popular stuffbut innovating and adapting to their creative vision Emphasis on creative I do wish it had about 6 more players (enough for two more squads and divisible by 4 for future modes) since sometimes you don't find anyone for a whileeven on top of it being a good new MOBA The game's flow/variables/adaptive strategies make each one feel very different (and I doubt any meta could change that - it's in the game's core)so even if the last one didn't go well I only see possibilities in the next They overwhelm other aspects of the game that might make you pessimistic in a different MOBAexcept you gather ingredients like a survival game instead of buying them At first I didn't think it mattered muchbut it's neat and makes every match refreshing because it's freeform instead of restrictiveand enough stuff happens while exploring that it doesn't feel like filler Could have easily just been a gimmick piling onto a dead horse genre You can also already save custom builds in your profilethe weapons don't actually impact much They give you an extra ability in the midgameand characters can't use all weapon types For some reason I thought each character had a ranged and a melee skillset you could swapwhich would appropriately make the game twice as good)but they're combinations of several fun characters instead of clones of a single popular oneand their presentation otherwise is mostly very cool Just [url=https://steamcdn-aakamaihdnet/steam/apps/1049590/ss_e6205a8bbab61b963bd2c5e08168652d04bb6c3a1920x1080jpg?t=1604545849]look at this gleeful psychotic grin[/url]I love it And characters often remark on the area around youlike the suit/katana guy talked about how sand is coarse and irritating when I was on the beachwhich is nice Also the guitar girl has [b]really[/b] cool sound effectsor skipping action steps like attack-move to attack-move-click) Maybe not praiseworthybut games rarely cover this properlythe ranged ones can't stutter-step effectively and if they try they'll get their legs broken by melee ones when they catch upand if you don't have CC people will just walk away from you While having a [u]dash or stealth[/u] makes survival to late game very easyabout the pace of old LoL (playing a few hours every day for a week to earn 1)which is currently absurd considering most have already sunk that time in games we can play instead of going through the chore againand that the market has buried most of their competitors who tried to do the same They're also transferring new characters very quickly from their previous gameso I'm not bothering to keep up However I'm happy with every unlockeven suboptimal characters or ones whose style doesn't fit me They do sell a few packaged charactersan insulting offer compared to what Smite gives for that priceyou can only buy charactersand they're overpriced Which is why I'm earning them and not even considering buying However I'd like to support EU servers through skinsbut they seem to be focusing on transferring characters from their old gamewhich is probably for the bestIt's like league without the constant urge to commit suicidei suck at this game but it's funThis game is similar to leagueexcept if it was a battle royale and you had to scavenge for your item components instead of buying them at a shopyou run around finding components and leveling up your character while fighting against other people to be the last one standing Each location also has a limited number of items that you can scavengeso once everyone takes them from a locationthey are gone from that location for the rest of the match AlsoIf you kill or find a body of an opposing player who was killed by someone elseyou can loot them for their wearable equipment as well as any items/components they had in their inventorysuch as gaining one skill point to level up skills per character levelcertain skills that seem very similar to certain league champion skills (ex Rozzi's Q = Lucian's Q & E into one skill)and there are neutral monsters laying around that you can kill to gain expthere are also a few differences Firstin addition to skill ranksthere are also mastery skills that are passive skills that give your character additional perks as you level them through a match For examplecrafting items and dealing weapon damage with your weapon will grant exp for your weapon skilland will grant you more damage with your weapon as it levels upyou can build each character as you like (tankydpsskill ampetc) and are able to change these items during your match as well (assuming you can get all the components for them) Howevercertain builds may work better for certain characters (similar to League)this game is a lot of fun If you enjoy league or battle royale gamesI highly recommend you try this game out It's a easy game to get intobut hard to master (Also a lot less toxic than league imo)I played the original Black Survival This one's differentbut I like it!but with Battle Royale rulesand scavenging all over it Souhyou can find rocksbranchessome plants and fish to gatherit has a short channel time and a bit of a cooldown that prevents any player from gathering the used up resourceyou have to find parts on the groundin containers around the mapor by hunting animals You have to craft armor itemsweapons and foodthere's animals you can kill that usually drop leathermeatfeathersand sometimes random itemswhile there's no hungerthere's health and stamina you can regenerate faster by eating and drinkingit regenerates your life and stamina by sitting down and chillinglike hunting by dealing damage to and killing animalsmovement by walking and exploring etcabilities and statsmaking the playable area smallerbut not for longduo or squadeach character has an affinity for a specific type of weaponryplayers won't try to murder you straight away For the first 1-3 levels or soa lot of players will either walk past youor back away when they encounter you Kinda nice imonothing more frustrating than dying straight awayyou can plan what gear you wantwhich will also show on the map the most important to visit zonesyou might struggle to find certain itemsor be completely unable to find themso plan out your route and pay attentionunlike in BRs where you progressively lose healthin this game you have 30s timer that's consequence free When timer hits 0you explode and die instantlythey're phones that are placed in some zonesthey'll instantly teleport you to whatever zone you chooseI believe it's just Dr Wickeline rnit's a fun game with pretty enough graphics Can be hard to learn for new playersas there's a lot of systems and itemsbut tutorials explain everything pretty well and the rest just comes with practice I honestly wish they put some lore into this game from the originalreally liked the journals and I'd love some more insight into this worldleague of legends is a trash gamePlayed this game quite a bitenjoyed it a lot back when it first entered early access I also participated in some tournaments and was pretty high rank before the burn out and disappointment hit meyou should know that boiled down to its core this game is an early game speedrun that transitions into a survival game Speedrunning the early portions of the game is a large part of the skill floor of this game and results in the biggest skill gap between players when climbing up to the point where you play against competent players You gather your build together and kill anyone that's behind in tempo Not traditional MOBA combat earlyso be warnedhad a strong difficulty curve and had enough depth to continue making me want to play Thenover timeweird decisions and bad additions to the gameas well as poor balance made the game no longer fun to playas well as being Masters for 3v3s when that mode existed (RIP) I'm very familiar with MOBA games and enjoy them a tonaround 20 minutes at most If you die earlyyou can just queue another game immediatelythoughsee below)but still has issuesand it's done on a consistent scheduleand earning access to all the characters for free is done wellwhich can be rough for new players but feels very nice for those that played beforehand The pacing was much slower previouslyespecially with base move speedresulting in a very snowballed gamebut some people will just walk up to you and attack you and chase youruining the game for both of you You won't diebut you'll be behind in tempo and die later anyways because now you're a couple minutes behind in your build This doesn't happen that often in higher rank gamesbut definitely can turn someone off from playing as they learn the game early onthis results in some zones being completely empty of useful mats if enough people do ityou're at a huge advantageand the ping difference is very easy to feel The delay for actions is very noticeablemoreso than other MOBA games like League I've had ping differences on servers range from 80 ping in one gamethen 100+ in the nextboth for Ohio serverswe don't need another layer of complexity Add that they threw a ""rune"" system into the game recently and it's just needlessly complicating the game The goal should be to smooth the game out and optimize the core so that new players can be comfortable playing and learning the gamethe game is pretty much over for you Many people just suicide if this happens in normal matchesbecause your friends are not gonna have fun sitting there watching you hide from people for 15 minutes You CAN revive your alliesbutglad they changed that Howeverif you aren't full build when you dieit's pointless to revive because you'll come back with much less than everyone else and are essentially dead weight Butit's definitely better than it was beforechanging routes for specific characters in order to syncand understanding routing and funneling items in general are all required to play)yet are more interesting to newer players because they want to play with their friends This turns off a lot of potential new players from playingbut 3 man teams aren't fun Watch the 'pro' team games and see how degenerate matches arebut I think the cons ultimately outweighed the pros for me

1,"Wellmy review is mainly for beginners who have just started this game or willing to buy it This is also for them who had stopped playing it after some trivial hours of tryingif you want to get the fullest essence of this game then play with suitable co-op partner(s) Some who enjoys solothey may say different but as I played solo because I had none to play withso I felt even boring in some point and so also I felt how much the experience would be better with suitable co-op partner(s)better lootor think that while you are reloading your gunyour co op partner still firing and thus you will be less hurt by enemies) and the game itself prompts for co-op although everything can be done in solo except few achievementsincluding DLCs and need patience to finish them all Howeveras I said beforethis is a hard core game with almost a lot enemy everywheresoat some point you can feel frustrated if you donâ€™t have proper levelled equipment and so you should farm for right things enough Here again comes the advantage of co-op; such as you 4 people if farm for 4 weapons and then you can make duplicate of those [though it is a glitch] and you 4 can be well equippedâ€¦ which chance does not exist in solo and so can be a lot time consuming and monotonous to be advancedas I was when I started this gameâ€¦ may be a problem to understand the architecture of the game At the very beginning the game starts in NORMAL mode Once you will finish the main gameâ€¦ then TVHM [True Vault Hunter Mode] will be unlocked which you can take as medium difficulty Re-playing the game in TVHM mode from the beginning once you reach at level 50 and then so also if you have finished the last mission of main storythen UVHM [Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode] will be unlocked for you So take this as hard mode There are over power [OP (1 to 8)] mode also where you can think it as very hard difficulty mode where enemy is up of your level but that can be unlocked once you reach the ultimate level of the gameie level 72 Sothe main game will take you upto the level 50; The UVH pack 1 will take you upto 61 and UVH pack 2 will take you to level 72[h1][u]DO NOT BUY THE BASE BORDERLANDS 2 GAME[/u][/h1]the Handsome Collection bundle contains much more:making the bundle a total savings of more than [b][i]90%[/i][/b]Borderlands 2 is a game for those that enjoy the feeling of finding awesome equipment hidden in a massive pile of other stuffyou don't NEED to go in-depth with this game  On the first playthrough you can get by with just picking up gear as you travel alongchoosing stuff that looks better than your current gearand maybe occasionally buying something in the vendor that looks handy  The deeper you go down the rabbit hole howeverthe more there is to discoverand dialogue is often amusing to a degree  Handsome Jackthe main antagonist is a cartoon villain with M rated attitudes  He believesor at least pretends to believe that he is the good guyand you are just a ""Filthy Bandit""the game has a lot more variations in design and color scheme than it's predecessor (which was brownbrownand a bit of color here and there)  Cell shaded graphics with thickgraphic novel like outlines is the style of the gameand does a good job of separating it from the average FPSon to the gameplay itself!:you'll find battles where you have to fight hard to win  The game does a decent job of easing you into the various elementssuch as different gun types (PistolSMGAssault/Combat RifleShotgunRevolverRocket Launcherand Sniper Rifle)the importance of a good shieldgrenade mods (alter the way your grenade behavesincluding damage bonuses and special effects)Class Mods (Class-specific devices which can boost skillsand have other effects like increasing fire rate with specific weapon types)and lastly Relics (Device which generally boost damage or defence in some way)  Equipment rarity is also made fairly clear  It goes WhiteGreenBluePurpleMagentaOrangeSeraphand Pearlescent  The final two rarities (Pearlescent and Seraph) are special  Seraphs require you to have at least one of the season pass DLC to obtain (and you need all 4 of the Season Pass DLC to obtain all the Seraph rarity items)and as to Pearlescent rarity weaponsyou need to be in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (Playthrough 3) for them to have a chance of being spawned  Don't assume that a blue is automatically better than a green rarity itemeven at the same level  Experiment!and two DLC characters  Each class has it's ups and downsand a special game changing skill unique to them  For exampleSalvador (Gunzerker) will dual-wield guns when his action skill is activemeaning TWICE THE FIREPOWER  Axton (Commando) drops a turretwhich damages enemies and draws aggression away from you  Maya (Siren) locks an enemy's movements for a short timeallowing you to get in free hits  Zer0 turns invisible for a few seconds and launches a decoyand his first attack made whilst in this mode does increased damage  The DLC characters are Gaige (Mechromancer) who launches a flying robot that attacks nearby enemiesand Kreig (Psycho); a schizophrenic musclebound maniac that will whale on everything within reach with increased offensive and defensive capabilities and can even throw his axe at more distant targetsthere are various other skills that you can put points intoand have an effect on gameplay in some way  For exampleincreasing fire rate or damage for a few seconds after a kill is made  Each character has 3 skill treeseach ending with a final gamechanging skill modifier  For exampleZer0's Bloodlust (Melee) tree ends with the Many Must Fall perkwhich will instantly re-deploy the hologram if he kills the enemy with one melee strike  As mentioned beforeClass Mods unique to a character class will boost certain skills  It's possible for them to go as high as +6meaning some skills can be boosted to 11as the normal limit on points you can put into most skills is 5though some skills are only 1 (those usually affect the way you play)there is a gun that shoots swordsEXPLODING swordsIn DLC4 (Tiny Tina's Assault on the Dragon Keep)  So yeahthere is that tooeven if it might be a bit messy XDDefinitely one of the best ""new"" games I have played This game is fun to play solo or over the net with friends The characters are wittyyeah even Claptrap :) Graphics are beautiful Even after playing this game over 3000 hours; the game gives wow-moments to me And every time there's something new and the vast choice of weaponsshields and other gadgets So I full-heartedly recommend Borderlands 2 And yesI will play co-op with you :)After some extensive testingI have come to the conclusion that Borderlands 2 is a very good game It can keep you amused forumquite a whileEdit 1 2017-08-01: Please stop joining my gamemy anxiety can't handle itbeing my number one favourite I couldn't think of a way to make it unbiased But after the resurgence of Open world gamesthe downfall of AAA and the battle between TF2 and OverwatchI think I can finally pinpoint what makes it so beautifulit's filled with colour and despite being cartoony it feels more realistic than the grim grisley greyness of SkyrimMorrowindWitcher etc It's not perfect of coursewith clipping and terrible lip sync but with the cartoony atmosphere it adds to the exaggerated charm that it providesthe way it has been presented is genius There are a lot of gay charactersblack charactersfemale characters- but these characteristics do not define who they are The characters still have peronalitiesthey just happen to be these things- they are not just addonsit just adds to the depth of the worldand this Borderlands nails too A lot of games can't tell whether they want to be simple or complicatedthey can't tell what gimmicks they want to useso they use everything and it turns into an incoherent mess [url=http://steamcommunitycom/id/darkregin2/recommended/391540/]like Undertale[/url] Borderlands knows exactly what it wants to do It's a Single Player or Co-Op FPS with RPG mechanics with levelling and loot systems The RPG mechanics make it feel more open worldy than most open world games It defines what towns existand gives you fast ways to get to themand while games like Skyrim use the open world idea to make you travel for hoursBorderlands 2 just adds a lot of depth with;

I haven't really mentioned the DLC (of which there is a lot) in this review but the main ones (Mr Torgue'sCaptain Scarlett and especially Tiny Tina's) are all well worth getting (these are included in the Game of the Year edition)great fun to play and add loads more content to the game To progress to the highest level in the game (level 72 +overpower levels) you will also need the ultimate vault hunter pack 2 so I would recommend that if you reach the end and still want more [/td]There is something to be said for a game that I just don't get sick of I have owned this on console and played through TVHM at least 4 times with 4 different characters there Played all the DLC except Tiny Tina on consolebut when the GOTY edition became so cheap on PC I jumped at it and bought all the Headhunter DLCsand the Ultimate Vault Hunter Pack as well So I can now play through the game THREE times on a character Darbut the funny thing is that I don't even finish itor even come close to it now I'm in a mass addiction to boosting my Badass Ranks so I just keep trying to ""prestige"" it instead of moving on and going towards UVHM xDand then quit playing Unfortunatelyfor me anywaysI don't do that I keep playing for hoursand I let all the other hundreds of games in my library continue to pile upand truly it can bebut don't disregard this game as a single player game It is insanely addictiveand it actually poses some slight challenges to you to play it solo Beating Raid Bosses solo is actually a genuine accomplishmentif you can actually do it They are meant to be beaten witha 4 player teambut you CAN beat many of them solo The new Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (UVHM) makes it an even more insane challenge to play solo just for the regular game enemies Needing to pump them full of slag just so you can actually get ready to start damaging them with any real power Of course all this is basically a math problem of damage output vs damage defensesimply putis one of the best games ever made in my opinion The sheer addictiveness and fun in playing it are jsut off the charts I recommend this to anyoneeven if you think you won't like it I thought Borderlands 1 looked stupid for years until I bought it for $5 with everything and realized how amzing the concept is and how it was made for OCD gamers Now they are both 2 of my most played games everand I don't see myself stopping BL2 anytime soon After all I ahven't even used The Psycho yet!UVH Packand allt he Headhunter DLCs for less than $20 BTWthese DLCs are legit and worth buying This isn't some garbage map pack DLCor jsut skins These are high quality and large DLCs on the scale of the FAllout DLCsand add even more than that in some of tehm GOTY edition has almost too much content >_>Better than Borderlands 3This game is infinite You can play it whatever you like and it's always fun I've said enoughBetter than Borderlands 3 tbhI had played 1200 hours before I even tried any of the DLC Nowif that doesn't speak to the incredible level of fun and depth that this game bringswellI just don't know that anything canhelping the pooror working on my home But not oftenNice gunplay?

0,"TarkovIN SPAAAAAACE. But seriously it does seem like a more casual Tarkov experience that is pretty damn fun. I have high hopes for this gamebecause this is just the beta.Very funhope they keep beta open permanentlyStreamlined Tarkovmore arcadey and fluid. Wouldn't say better combat but for me its funner in The Cycle. Also lots of quality of life features (you almost instantly enter a matchno base inventory juggling for 10-15 mins between a matchautomatic turn insno bags in bags in bags nonsensedont need 2-3 screens to feel optimaleasy to understand objectives and items) that lets me focus on the things I likewhich is lootingexploring/stalkingfighting and getting the hell out. This is fun and solid for a closed betaespecially compared to some more recent betas heh. If the game is this good nowI bet its gonna be a banger when it releases next year.300+ hours in cycle on epic launcher....Yeah no. Old one was definitely a better choice.""Space Tarkov""and or if there will be a wipe system. I am also excited for more loot collections as they add more content and stuff to loot. There are aliens in game that are the equivalent to scavs in Tarkov that terrorize the players as you try to loot. The more harder/more mobs there are in that areathe more loot.but it feels like the servers is worse than CS's and Rust hitreg. Spawning is currently broken where I have had people spawn inside of me before i've even deployed (hopefully a fix soon)they should be developing and focusing on making this game fire. I am only scared of this because they have already implemented a tiered battle pass which is never a good sign right off the bat. If its ftp then that makes sense (bc how else would they make money) but I'm sick of all these games coming out with a battle pass.Tarkovin Spacewith monsters. That's what i heard.to be able to use their high power gunsthere you goI really want to like this game.  It's got an interesting settingbeautiful worldgreat soundtracktakes a lot of inspiration from Tarkovand definitely has a lot of potential.the combat leaves far too much to be desired for this to warrant any serious time investment.  There's simply nothing to master & the systems are far too basic.  Weapons feel terriblebullets go nowhere near where you're aimingmovement is a chore and the stamina mechanic simply pads out the time it takes to move from point A to B.  I understand Tarkov was a big inspirationbut a stamina bar just doesn't work if the rest of the game is so arcadey and basic.lack of depthand it's missing a LOT of QOL features for a beta.  I don't know much about the dev cycle of this gamebut this definitely still feels like an early alpha to me.  There just isn't enough meat on the bones to consider the hook of the game worthwhile at all.  For this to compete in the FPS marketthe combat & movement need a TON of work.  I refuse to play Tarkov because of how janky and clunky it feelsand unfortunately this feels just as badbut the systems are 1/10th as deep.  Will check back in 6 months or a year and see where it's at.Breath of fresh air after tarkov's china level pollutionI played dozen of hours of the original The Cyle that was present on the EGSI stopped playing when I had to bring my pc to do an hardware reset and I decided to have only 1 launcher on my machine.I applied for getting the alpha access so I could play again with randoms using the good ol' komrad+bibg momma combobut when I got the access and installed it I found out that the game was veryveryvery different than it once was.The Cycle has become a ripoff of Escape from Tarkovand a pretty bad at that. The game became slow and sluggishgone are the suits that gave you access to different mobility optionsthe weapons went from an unlockable to your account to a weapon that you can potentially loose forever in a bad runammo are now limited and scarse (in the low games that I played)alongside with many other problems that I do not care to find out because the game just bored me to death.if shipped like thisis gonna be dead on arrival. If the dev team wants to have a chance to get some players they really need to go back to the formula they first hadaka mobile pve+pvpmission based battle royalbut reworking the materials mechanicsadding either cosmetic stuff to crafta base to build or a guild to work towardsor even periodic events where the top players/guilds that gave the most materials would get a reward (maybe having the top 3 guild banners in the lobby of every game? I dunno). This would even fit better with the whole setting than what we have now.pray and wait that the game will get rollbacked andif that happenshope that I haven't bought my Komrad yetRelatively well polished and put together for a closed betawith some innovative additions and design changes. Overall I 100% recommend for anyone interested in this type of gameI see a bright future for The Cycle. The gunplay and overall combat feels very clean and responsive.I've found mixing Solo/Duo/Trio queues in this game to be relatively problematicgiven the somewhat high time to killand features that make team play easysuch as seeing your team members through walls and with an outline; this is not an issue in Tarkov as there is no reliable way to differentiate friend from foeand the time to kill is so fast a solo player can easily catch a 5 man squad off guard and destroy them. Howeverin Cycleif a solo player turns a corner and there are two enemies thereeven with superior aim and reflexes it is unlikely he will be able to kill both of them before he dies (assuming all players have relatively equal equipment).).the default tier of backpack and even the first craftable tier (green) do not allow for many items to be carried. I believe players who want to risk staying in a match longer or fighting more playersshould be able to effectively benefit from this choice by carrying out more loot. As it standsit is most efficient from a value acquisition standpointto enter a match and fill your bag up within 10-20 minutes and just leave.given that there are no quests (from what I have experienced) that require you to directly kill other playersand that the value to weight ratio of player loadouts is inefficient to carry. I would love to see the game add decent rewards for players who prefer to hunt other players appose to completing all of the PvE and gather quests.but these are the primary problems I encountered regarding system and design decisions. Overall I believe The Cycle is a great game that fills a gap in the shooter market that was previously not catered to. I am optimistic about the games future moving forward.Based on the time I have spent in The Cycle's Discord serverand the brief correspondence I have had with members working on the gamethe team comes off as capablecaringpassionateand most importantly receptive to feedback. A huge +++ for the game.Lost all the individuality of the original and somehow runs worse than it used to.Beta has been thrillingfiguring out monstershow to beg people for your lifeand crouching for 30 yards because you thought you heard something behind you. The blend of PvPvE is done wellaudio plays such a large part of what you're doing and where you're going. Cool few maps already to check out and a quite a few gunsmaterialsand things to upgrade/research that seem promising. Can't wait to see morehow the game/community growsand how they handle it all.GoodYo This recommendation is after just 26 hours in the gameand let me tell you I am getting more and more addicted to this game :DApex LegendsHunt: Showdown or maybe a breed of them all into one? Then this is the game for youthat this game has the most potential and highest quality of ANY closed beta or early access game I have seen EVER. It can even compare to early access and several published games in terms of performancefeaturesserverscontent and the execution of the content. Sure it needs some polish to really shine like the Sunbut so far it already does an exellent job of blinding me ;)I can recommend this game for those lads and lassies as well :)yes. Not the same as Tarkovbut similar enough to be comparable.there's no flea marketmeaning each raid has real value and a lot of it compared to Tarkov - thus keeping the economy strongkeeping the game in a similar state to 'early wipe' Tarkov for much longerallowing newer players an easier and more fun time playingwhilst rewarding and still challenging higher tier players.there's literally 0 waiting time when wanting to get into a match. Click ready and you're inthe second or two of black screen all depends on how fast your SSD/HDD ismaking it much less infuriating when you die as you don't feel like you've wasted 20 minutes just to get killed in the first 2.there's not too much bad about this game. Provided content will be added in the future the only thing I could complain about is the small variety of monsters and how weapons scale to make them a pretty much none-existent threat.a great game for when released   . its simular to escapefrom tarkov     id recomend playing the game if your decent with shooter games . with a little luck and lots of aim youl enjoy a high risk reward enviroment for upon death you lose your gear  and theres always an unexpected thing around the corner so check your six when entering areas.its a lot like the original cycle game but it has a lot of improvements and I would definitely recommend over the old cycleSuper soild beta had alot of funReally enjoyed the betai'll be playing it as soon as it launches"

That will be explained belowas in any idle gameconsists of doing something and then idling for most of the time This can be shaken up by (voluntary) challenges which give special rewards or just general improvmentsbut make sense to progress faster The challenges require you to reach a certain progress at allwithin 24 hourswith some features disabledetcthere is a progression with unlocks every now and then The new features contribute to the gameplaythey give additional bonuses if you explore thembut you idle them as well as you do with most other thingswhich you use to train yourself and progress by beating ""Bosses""then reset to make the training cost modifiers go down so you can train faster Very early you unlock magicwhich unlocks additional trainingthe same loop applies During this time you rebirth every hour optimallybut also provides adventure stat bonusesbonuses for other mechanicsand even the legendary ""cooking"" mechanic With the drops of equipmentyou also collect ""boosts"" that can enhance your equipmentor an ""infinity cube""which is actually giving you 1 percent of the boost as a permanent bonusup to a soft cap that is determined by your basic statisticsthe main one is spending experience which you get from beating bossesbut later better by other means (which would be a spoiler) So as you get strongerbeat more bossesprogress through the gamenew features unlock The ""NGU"" is a feature that is titular and allows you to permanently increase your statistics in multiple areasincluding how fast the NGU itself goes - the Energy NGU can boost Magic NGUand Magic NGU can boost Energy NGUbut the softcap makes a target that can be reached within minutes at full speed Realistically you will need some dayshoweverbut feel that progress improves As you grow stronger and power up your energy and magic as well as increase its capyou can progress faster through the NGU levelsmore permanent bonuses can be unlocked by various means The first real main objective is to beat boss 301and on the way there you unlock most features Then you can start the next difficulty where more features can be unlockedsome old features offer new permanent rewardsbut everything takes longer to progress Working your way up therethe same gameplay loop of getting stronger just by playing appliesmaking the game one to run in the background - or thanks to newer patches just quit after it autosavedand some are pretty much required for your sanity What sounds horrible at first actually is very fairas you earn the premium currency just by playing dailylater there are even other features that give you a steady stream of it Where buying something new takes weeks at firstlater you can buy something every few days This isobviouslywithout investing real money In factbuying premium currency with real money actually might diminish the fun as it makes you progress a bit faster than intended Howeverif you want to support the developerin my opinion the ""Name in Game"" pack is the best ideaalthough expensive You get then added to a list of enemies in one feature of the game You automatically kill thembut apart from the namethey are just normal enemies that drop a reward used for that featurebecause I asked if I ""can"" NoI MUST recommend this game Although I have not even 7000 hours in and due to some mistakes I made progressed too slow in some partsI tremendously enjoy the game Grantedmost of the time was just letting the game run in the background But that is what idle games are for They don't demand muchexcept one that deliberately is unfair but still funno purchase is necessaryso you have to make sometimes tactical and often strategical decisionswhich are encouraged to use by giving daily free premium currencyso you gain more rewards if you play longerkeeping up with the gameplayadds new features every now and then which you can unlockbut that is what keeps the motivation going even after a year of playingmaxing them gives bonusessome ingame achievements are also Steam achievementsalthough you will not want to switch to a lower one when you can handle the higher one (except for finishing the rest of the challenges there or for getting strong enough at first to tackle the higher one)only later you can check the game once or twice a day to get the daily rewardsand one premium itemthe advanced loot filteris absolutely necessary for your sanitythe wiki helpsand you gain permanent bonuses by rebirthing with the right features unlockedyou love NGU IdlenumberThis is a low quality game and massive waste of time - in all the best ways I have played every day for well over a year and I can't imagine stoppingThis game looks like a school project but Ive played for 600 hoursIve become addicted to numbers and Im being held hostage please helpIf you value your spare time don't get this game"
1,"As an old guy who is new to online FPS this game is very tough It is on the realistic side  One shot will usually kill you or the enemy   Artillery and tank fire is devastating   I died  at least 20 times before I even saw my first enemy   I finally fired my gun after about two hours of playing   And it took me about 4 hours of playing before I actually killed an enemy  I appreciate it is difficult  It makes any success I have more rewarding  The game looks fantastic and it plays very well  I am sure if you have any FPS online experience it will go easier for you  Newbies should take baby steps and have patience  Spend a lot of time being a grunt infantryman  Learn the game until you move on to other jobs  I have joined empty servers just to practice throwing grenades   I have 15 hours playing and I am still learning the game and playing as a basic infantryman   It is a very entertaining game  But be prepared to die a lot and you must have patience to learnA detailed HLL review/overview (UPDATE 10)it's less hardcore than a game such as Post Scriptum and therefore is enjoyable for casual gamers but is challenging enough to satisfy Hardcore playersthis means running with your squadlistening to your Squad Leader and communicating oftenlone wolfs generally have a lower overall score than someone who plays with his squadkills do not count for many points but are satisfying nonethelessespecially the *tink* sound of headshotscommunication wins games and you don't want to be having to stop every 10 seconds to type somethingthey are the static point at which your entire team can spawn atthey require a Squad Leader and a support player to buildthe support drops ""supplies"" and the SL builds the ""garri""this is a mini garrison that only your squad can deploy onArmourRecon or Commanderthey push the objectivesprotect your tanks and cap points while also defending positions while other squads attack the point You are awarded points when you are in enemy and friendly territory so staying back and defending captured positions nets you just as much points as attacking while also allowing you to have the defenders advantage of the enemy pushing right infront of your gunyou play as a 3 man squad (DriverGunner and Spotter) it is your task to eliminate enemy tanks and support the infantryit is adrenaline filled fun and hugely excitingit is your responsibility to keep your frontal armor facing the enemybut it also takes skill and patience to place a shot from 700m+ and hit the right spot to do the most damageespecially if you are outgunned by a heavier tankthis position is very importantyou have a periscope which enables you to see the enemy from long rangesthis means you may be telling your gunner to shoot somewhere so far away he/she cannot see the target and are relying on you to use the marking system (called pinging) to see targets The driver also relies on you to help find a path through the countryside because he only has a small window slit to see throughso againcommunication is keyLuchs light tank(armed with 20mm autocannon) Panther medium tank (very mobile but hard hitting medium tank with a 75mm gun) and the Heavy Tiger tank (slow and methodical beast with it's massive 88mm gun)Stuart Light tank (37mm) the 75mm and 76mm Sherman Jumbo'sBA-10 recon carT-34/76 and IS-1 Heavy tankSoviet) or a 8x scope (Germans) While there is a massive difference in zoom between the two scopesthe smaller zoom on the American/Soviet rifle allows for quicker and more aggressive up close play (100m-250m) while the german scope is cumbersome therefore encourages you to finding a nice position and picking the enemy off from 250m-500m Recon is responsible for either helping your team push by taking out high value targets such as MG'sofficers or other Recon Squads but can also slip behind the lines and destroy enemy garrisons and resource nodes (more on those later)recon can place theirs anywhere which enables deep flanks and stealth missionsyour 6 man squad is relying on you to make informed and quick decisions on a tactical levelie Do you move to the exposed flank and hold it from a vantage point such as a farmhouse and prevent the enemy from streaming throughor do you be more aggressive and try to flank yourself while having to worry about your comrades being hit from that exposed flank?patience and also making snap decisions as well as taking advice from other squad members Your main role is to push the points with your squadflank the enemymark enemy movement on the mapbuild garrisons to support the push and communicate with other SL's and the Commander constantlyall while under fire and trying to figure out where the enemy aresome prefer to get down and dirty building defensive or offensive garrisons and being closer to the front linewhereas others prefer to sit further back and direct traffic from their map (more like an RTS game) and micromanageand the only way to acquire them is for SL's to have 2 members of their squad (support for the suppliesand an engineer to build) build "" nodes""these consist of munitionsmanpower and fuelgarrisons or just to fortify a chosen area (engineers can build bunkers etc with suppliesanti-tank can build AT-guns) Manpower enables the Commander to use specific offensive/defensive abilities while fuel allows the Commander to spawn in tanksand recon vehiclesif the Commander has no resources because players have not built nodes they cannot do these thingsand as anyone who has played an RTS knowsNo resources= no winbecause it is much more nuanced and does require you to be a stingy buggeryou need to make hard decisions and prepare to take the blame if it back fires in your faceand focus on the greater strategical picture My advice is to be firm but not a tyrantevery SL will be telling you ""we need supplies here"" or ""we need a bombing run here""it is up to you to decide whether they actually need those things or if they could be better put to good use and send them another squad to help out insteadit is 100% worth it and the community (Australian at least) is very welcoming and helpfulPlease go into the Options > Gameplay and max the slider onYou spawn at the end of the map and have to run 5 minutes straight towards the enemy linesbecause your spawn points got overrun by an enemy tankjust to get a headshot from god knows wherekilling your allies left and righta balanced gaming experience or cool ranks to show off withhoping that they don't spot you while an enemy tank rolls next to the dead tree you and your buddys lay behindlet them get past and start firing which makes for a surprising and chaotic fight in the middle of nowherebut that makes them feel 10 times better and you will remember these moments because they have more impactnothing feels more rewarding than pulling of a successful maneuver the other team did not expect and rushing their last base in the cover of your tanks while your allies beside you scream out their victoryMy very first game on HLL: I join a serverselect the Alliesenter an open squad (yesthey can be locked) and select a machinegunner As soon as the match begins the squad's officer asks via voip if there are any new players I answer ""me""ask him and my other squaddies to forgive me if I make mistakesand the squad leader just laughs it off and tells me ""no worriesjust follow my directionskeep your eyes sharp and your ears sharper and you'll do fine"" And thenwe start moving towards a quaint French town called Carentanthe squad leader tells us ""Our orders are to occupy it and defend the area no matter the costs Watch out for windows and rubble because there'll be Krauts everywhere"" And there WERE lots of Krauts in the area I run forward in the open like a headless chickenand a German rifleman shoots me in the torso I crumple to the groundas the noises all around me grow duller and duller and my vision starts to blur as life abandons methe squad's medic shouts So I waitwhile the medic tosses a smoke grenade to conceal his movementsreaches my dying frame and brings me back to the realm of the living with a quick morphine shot ""Now dive for cover! Go behind those barrels over there!""he tells mewhich I eagerly dostill bleeding out Once behind coverthe medic pulls out the bandages and starts to apply a field dressingwhile the squad leader checks the surroundings with his binocularsdamn it!""and before I ask him exactly which windowhe points me a specific one in the distance I squint my eyes as hard as I canand notice that there are indeed a couple of indistinct shapes looking at us I then deploy my mighty M1919 heavy machinegunignoring the gunshots that plink all around meand start laying down a withering hail of suppressive fire against that and nearby windows I doubted I ever got a single krautbut that wasn't what mattered - what mattered was that the jerries had no way of peeking out of those windows without getting mulched With me supporting their advancethe remainder of my squad moves towards the building under the cover of smoke grenadeswhile our riflemen toss as many grenades inside the windows as they can I hear gunshots coming from the buildingsa couple of players curse as they get downed while the squad leader shouts ""I've got 'emI've got 'em! Come here gunnerwe need your mg!""not aiming at anybody in particular but still managing to hit me - again - and cause me to bleed NeverthelessI manage to get inside the building and get the medic to patch me up again ""This is becoming a habitmate I should start to charge you for every dressing""he jokes We both laughat least until a kraut tosses a grenade inside a nearby windowsomething the medic does not notice ""Grenade right behind you! Run!""I yell at him We both run as far away from that room as possible right as the grenade goes offI emerge unscathed from the blast but the medic is hit and starts bleeding ""Cover me while I patch myself up""he asks mebut right at that moment one of our squaddies who was garrisoning the building's ground floor yells ""OH s**tthey're insi-"" before an SMG burst causes him to scream Realizing that there's only one way up the building and that I am right in front of the stairsI lay on the ground and deploy my machinegun yet again A kraut climbs the stairs and runs right in front of my machinegungetting riddled with bullets and falling on the spot Two more krauts enter after himboth of which get similarly cut down while I yell ""they're coming! Right up the stairs!"" A friendly rifleman arrivestosses a couple of grenades down the stairsand I see torn human limbs flying everywhere ""Germs're sanitized""he shouts back The squad leader laughs it offcongratulates us bothand then orders us to keep marching towards the church at the center of Carentan It's only 100 meters away from our positionbut due to a german Tiger parked right in front of it and at least two German platoonsit might as well be miles and miles awayand the germans are the ones desperately scrambling away from that hulk of steel on tracksfalling back inside the church Around the churchartillery fire starts falling on the battlefield like raintearing to pieces any soldier unfortunate enough to get hit Undauntedour assault specialist throws a couple of smoke grenades before getting cut down by submachinegun fire His heroic sacrifice allows us to enter inside the church in relative safety and engage the last kraut holdouts in a desperate close quarters battle they are hopelessly outmatched for due to their bolt-action rifles and the elevated number of automatic and semi-automatic firearms we possessthe church of Carentan has fallen into Allied handsbut we do not even have the time to pat on each other's shoulders that a massive artillerly barrage rains all around the church Allied soldiers who aren't quick or lucky enough to get inside are pulverized by the concentrated explosive firethe sherman that was covering us gets blown to smithereensand all that's left to defend the capture point is our 5-men squad and a rifleman from another platoon who somehow made it to the church by the skin of his teethour squad leader orders us We dash for the church's bell tower like madmenwhile the rifleman straggler tosses a couple of grenades to cover our retreat Finally at the top of the bell towerI realize that it is spacious enough to give us ample room for manoeuversgives us a very nice overlook of the entire townand has only one way in or out ""Defend the bell tower at all costsG*ddammit!""I hear the squad leader scream ThusI pick a spot with a clean line of sight to the stairs and deploy my trusty machinegun againin unorganized waves that get mercilessly scythed down at firstand in coordinated attacks with grenadessmoke grenades and submachinegunners later Me and the straggler get shot againbut the medic in our team quickly bandages up again It is only in that moment that I realise my machinegun is completely out of ammo ""Out of ammo!""I yell to my squaddieswhich prompts the straggler to drop an ammo box right next to me Thanking himI proceed to restock while the Germans keep on assaulting our position The situation grows more and more desperate untilat long lastit happensthree whole platoons of soldiers supporter by a Sherman Jumbo Realising that they have been beatenthe krauts cease their attempts to storm the bell tower and focus on the attackers It is at that moment that our squad leader orders us on the offensive With the desperation that only a cornered animal can musterwe toss the very last two grenades we have down the stairway and catch the german defenders in a devastating pincer attack The church of Carentan is now ours once againfor real this time The squad leader congratulates us allme in particular ""You did very well for a first timermate"" -

60% - it's clear that the devs have not considered or cared to give higher quality graphics options for those of us with capable hardware (the devs are apparently going by the Steam Hardware Surveywhich is totally inaccurate when compared to HLL players - a reddit poll found that 55% of HLL players have RTX cards)but there are rough edges that will likely never be sorted out HLL is an indie game that likes to pretend it's AAAbut it's far from itNot knowing who shot youwhere fromor what with No health barno radarno silly pop up turrets or calling in helicopter gun ships No forcefields or shields And no idea how many bullets left in your clip (assuming you had one) The suppression of being pinned by machine gunsnot being able to swim and fear of what lies behind every wallhedgerows for cover and learn to count the bullets If you cant see who is making the foot stepsjust start shootingyou run for 13 km and then get shot by a guy you never see 11/10>played new soviet mapsI don't often review games because I am lazybut this game deserves it I am a 32 year old gamer and my fps experience goes back to Doom I played all the FPS games A few of the cod'sall the counter stirkesmost the battlefieldstribesunreal'squake'stitanfallsrainbow six etc This game is different then them all Team work isn't wanted its absolutely needed There is no kill feedno glamour for the solo person with 50 kills at the end you just get to celebrate the win while your countries music plays on the score tab Its a veryvery different game I am not super familiar with this genre having only played ARMA 3 for a few hours but the people playing this game are passionate A lot of them take everything super serious which has its ups and downs but mostly ups The player base is small enough you start to see the same people in gamesbut its large enough its always possible to find a full server to play on in less than 5 minutes There is so many niches to fill in this game I suggest watching a youtube video before loading it up The strats you need to win in this game take a lot of team coordination (average game has around 10 diff squads all geared towards diff tactics to help you win) I'm semi drunk and rambling but I really enjoy this gameyes there are times where you are getting crushed and you basically spawn inrun for 5 mins and die but those are few and far between After a few games you get the hang of it start your own squad so you can have some control on where to place down spawn points Who knowsmaybe someday you'll have the balls to lead the entire 50 person team as commanderShowed this to my German grandpa and he started telling me where the best camping spots wereWhatever you dodon't play it like it's call of dutyHell Let Loose lies at an excellent intersection between BattlefieldSquad and Insurgency It brings the scale of the formerthe logistics and teamwork of the middle and immediacy of the latter to impress with its 50 vs 50 WW2 battles that teeter between bombastic chaos and matter-of-fact single shot kills Having just two modes - a 90 minute Warfare mode with single objective conquestand the staggered 30 minute Offensive mode where a frontline is gradually and permanently pushed back by attackers -restricting loadout customisation to two or three presets and no allowance for custom rules might seem overly strict or boring to somebut really it allows the game to enjoy an unusual focus foRr a genre that's by now bogged down in noise and lack of polish HLL's ambition is to push you into almost a slice of life style of storytellingwhere each individual is but a small cog in a grand machinewhere equipment and abilities are restricted to rolesthemselves restricted to categories: At the top of the pyramid sits the commanderwho gets access to the leader voice chat channel to communicate with officersand who can use map-wide abilities like supply dropsbombing runsspawn vehicles or issue map marker orders for the team Beneath the commander are the officerswho are in charge of relaying information between their squad and other officers and the commanderand issuing orders to their squad An infantry officer's squad who has access to the usual shooter roles: Engineers can build and destroy structuressupport can provide construction supplies and ammomedics can revive and heal teammatesassault gets access to SMGs and more grenadesand so on Each squad is expected to follow orders from their officer and communicate as a small team of their own Alternatively to infantrythere are special squad types for recon and armourwith two-man sniper teams and tank crews respectivelyeach having their own specialised roles and exclusive abilities and geara match will unfold with the three squad types working together under their officerswho in turn work with other officers and their commander as one great teamshifting between attackdefence and support The latter is most interestingbecause there are cases where some players or even an entire squad will be dedicated to logisticsdriving supply trucks back and forth to build defenses in controlled territory These unofficial roles are just as important as any medic or riflemanallowing players to fortify pointsman artilleryor act as infantry support or repair crews for tanks Participating in this massive cooperation never fails to be thrilling I enjoy getting headshots on the frontline or sneaking into an enemy objective and laying mines downbut there's a quiet satisfaction to spending an hour transporting supplies to engineers or building intricate layers of barbed wire and barricades that's just as rewarding Intellectually engaging with the mapthe movement of the teamevaluating risk and reward - these are rare treats that make not shooting a single time the entire match just as fun as doing so a thousand timesand no matter the roleextensive use of the map and compass's grid coordinatesbearingscardinal directions and distance measurements separates the good players from the bestbut it's one of the first pressure points where things can go horribly wrong A match in Battlefield can be turned around by a single personeven despite the vast scale All it takes is a great flank and quick reflexes or helicopter pilot to potentially dominate an entire teambut in HLL the opposite is true - most conquests are a meat grinder regardless of your individual experience or skill In fact the better both teams arethe longer conquest takes It can thus become frustrating to have your performance tied so intrinsically to the team's A great squad could theoretically turn the tablesbut most of the time you're simply at the mercy of your officer and commander (or lack thereof)and while the highs of teamwork are higher than they otherwise would bethe lows of miscommunication and a lack of team autobalancing are very low indeed This is offset by the game's intentional deemphasising of player statshiding kill/death ratios or victim/nemesis trackers away in a secondary screenbut the act of dying 20 times in a match and losing at the end still stings Such an issue is however an unavoidable result of the demands of teamwork When things go well - which they mostly do - HLL shines Matches tend to ebb and flow over wide frontlinesincorporating the staccato pacing that can at times near the absurd There are points when you'll have been lying on your stomach for five minutes until a single shot pierces the silence and your enemy a hundred metres away falls dead in a heapand the rifle's echo fades into silence; there are others when you'll be sprinting out of a trench into a wall of enemies in a vast field scarred by craters and debrisdodging the rain of bullets and competing bombing runs as tanks charge through the cacophony and their thunderous fire sends your head spinning The magnitude of the action can be truly impressiveand knowing that it's often the result of those 49 coordinating strangersfrom infantry riflemen to sniping saboteurs all following the violent vision of a single commander at the helmis awesomeimperfections in audioand poor level design that marr the proceedingsbut presentation and controls are generally excellentgiving HLL a sleekness uncharacteristic of multiplayer shootersand far surpassing Arma 3Squador any other milsims And realisticallyyou're going to struggle to find another indie/AA game that looks or sounds as good as thismuch less at such an enormous scale HLL isn't a perfect game by any meansbut its relentless focus on teamworktrimming of fatand straightforward design make it the best time I've had with a shooter in eons There isn't much room for one man army heroics in its actionwith all facets of its design encouraging and rewarding teamwork instead With ample space for gameplay styles from solitary sabotage to quiet construction and frontline armoured engagementsthere's something for everyone It's a mature game for players who are tired of the uncontrolled chaos of Battlefield or Call of Duty that makes most matches blend together into an indistinct haze of inconsequential mass slaughterand enormously thankfully it also eschews their stats pagesstorefrontscaricaturesque customisationbattle passesdaily missions and endless notifications and popups that make those competitors become overwhelming assaults on your senses that also demand to be treated like a second job It still needs some polishand some new maps and equipment would be welcomebut I've hugely enjoyed my time playing HLL Cerebral without becoming exclusionaryintense without becoming mind-numbingI cannot recommend this enough as a minimalistic breath of fresh airhelps me forget about hersaw a guy literally explode 10/10I played a medic and dispensed more Opiates than the Sackler familyFirst off I want to say that I have never reviewed a game before in my life but this game has changed that Nearly 2 hours in I was thinking Iâ€™d probably refund the game I didnâ€™t really understand the mechanicscouldnâ€™t see anyone to kill and often got killed out of nowhere after wandering around the map for a long long time trying to find some action Then I got talking in game to a few players and got caught up in their enthusiasm and missed the refund window so perseveredunforgivingbrutalbeautiful and requires teamwork and communication to get the best from itbut when it all falls into place itâ€™s an experience like no other Iâ€™ve had playing and FPS Itâ€™s immenseimmersivedeeptacticalterrifying and hilarious by turns You canâ€™t play this like Battlefield or CoD and it rarely rewards lone wolf activity behind enemy lines but when youâ€™re in a good squad with a decent command plan itâ€™s amazing fun and so rewarding when your efforts pay off with a point capture or even better a game winactive in the various places youâ€™d hope and willing to listen and alter roadmap priorities as a result of player feedback Thereâ€™s a public roadmap and patches already out and in mid July a big update coming with a new map amongst other added features and fixesEdited for now 21 hours Fix the shit with serversI don't give a shit about anything elsequeue's and loading times into new games take so long I don't want to play the game anymore"

Forget them!

It is so addicting that even fighting mobs in the same zonesagain and againis not a chorepower-upscombosspellscharms to learn and useand everything is easy to pick up Later in the gameyou roam the vast world of Hallownest like a deadly ninja-warlock-parkourist As with combatthe movement (after some progress) is also very satisfyingwhich looks unbelievably majestic in a world of militant bugs The music of Christopher Larkin is equally grand Everyone praises orchestral music in Ori and the Blind Forest / Ori and the Will of the Wispsalthough I prefer Hollow Knightâ€™s solemn and melancholic compositions They sound so softso gentlelike a lullaby or a fairy tale It oddly fits the gameplayprobably with ugly nostalgic sentiments along the line It is one thing when you experience this kind of bond with something when you are a kid It is another thing when the creation of human imagination manages to touch you similarly when you are long past your teenage years It means a lot to me Thank youTeam Cherry You did something truly exceptional hereYesyou're seeing it correctly I have 300+ hours* on this gameI played through about 250 of those hoursand I can confidently say that this isand might always bemy favorite gameit can definitely make you feel lost and a little frustrated trying to find out where to go (especially after Greenpathat least for me)many points in the game where you'll get stuck for literal hours trying to get past If you tilt easily or are an ardent completionistyou might have a bad time You will probably never get to the Land of Stormsthe movement mechanics can feel really unfairespecially at the most difficult platforming sections (WHY DOES MONARCH WINGS SEND YOU DOWN FIRST!?)although I think learning and mastering the mechanics is all just part of the gameI've heard that this game's story feels very similar Not sure how this is a conbut felt that it was important to mentionbut I think there's a reason this is my favorite gamethis game is massive My first 112% of this game took me a little under 100 hoursif not actually 100 hours Nowevery other playthrough of this game that I've done took me significantly less timebut considering that this game was made by a team of three people and that this game is a quarter the price of Dark SoulsI'd say that the amount of content in this game is remarkable And that content isn't filler content Few rooms in this game are Almost every room will have something new in iteither a new enemya new mechanic/upgradea piece of the storyor a secret Since its initial releasethree free content packs have come outalong with one ""major update"" with a paid DLC coming in 2019** Every one of the content packs released so far has had so much new contentincluding some of the most difficult bosses in the game Hidden Dreams came out with bosses thatif beaten enoughcan kill you with a single blow The Grimm Troupe arrived with a dream variant on a newalready-difficult boss that took me over three hours of attempts to beatalong with the hardest platforming that you might ever come across Finally[strike] Gods and Glory [/strike] Godmaster arrivedadding a bossrush modeexciting variants on old bosses that made them even more difficulttwo more endingsand a boss that easily overthrew the Grimm Troupe boss as the hardest enemy this game has to offerthe bosses are toughwell-designedand the learning curve for them is quite good I can say that I can count the number of bosses that I actually disliked on one handand that's being pretty harsh for a few of them And there are so manyand so many variants!the color pallet for everything in each area is spot onand they all contribute a part to the amazing story So immersive and so fleshed out It looks and sounds so good (bless youChristopher Larkenbless you)the story seems to be very baselinejust little bits of lore to piece together You don't even know who your character isalthough you just assume you're the Hollow Knight But slowlyyou learn about the devastating events that eventually leads to this beautiful world's demise There are five endingsand once you learn that there was more to do in order to fix this broken kingdomyou feel compelled to keep goingand is one of the richest worlds you will ever dive into You'll become a much better player just by getting through the gameand you're likely to love nearly every moment of it This is the only game that I've encountered that has significant portion of its player base sad that they didn't pay MORE for this game in order to support the developers An amazing world with an even better soundtrackI highly recommend this game above all othersthe genius company behind this gamedecided not to make the DLC THEY'RE INSTEAD MAKING AN ENTIRELY NEW GAME IN ITS PLACE This is also a pro for buying the game SUPPORT THIS AMAZING COMPANYDon't get it on a salebecause you'll feel like you owe the devs money The price is outrageously low for what you getBetter than sexI was playing the cracked version After 2 hours I realized this the game is way too good for that Bought without second thoughts~ DIFFICULTY ~[h1]Short Review[/h1]but still incredibly satisfying The art style is charming and filled with dread at the same timemaking it one of the most visually appealing The interwoven areas of Hallownest are as rewarding to explore as they're excitingwith each area offering something newboth visually and mechanically Even the few bugs can't ruin the momentum of this masterpiece of a gamea land of bugs hidden beneath the surface of the earthyet complex[/h2]functioning as your special move As you progress through the gameyou'll slowly get more special movesknown as Nail Artsbut I didn't find myself using them very often since you first had to charge them before being able to unleash them upon your foes Yetsomehow Hollow Knight manages to pull off the near-impossible: to make its combat simpleyet complex While this term is quite contradictoryIt's how I would best describe the combat I'm going to compare it to Dark Souls If you've played any of those gamesyou'll know that the range of attacks you can perform is very limited Where these games get their complexity from lies in the moves of the enemiesall of which have unique movesetswith each move being telegraphedallowing for the player to counter it before it's too late The same can be said for Hollow Knight I was impressed at the sheer number of different enemies since I went in knowing that the game was made by a very small team of people According to the game itselfthere are over 100 different enemy types Suresome of them are different variations of one kindbut most of them are unique This creates an experience that never gets tiresomeeven though the game isn't that complex There are still some possibilities for those who want to specialize in certain character builds The game offers you a set of Charms that you can equip to get different bonuses These could be extra range for your weapon or a shield that protects you while you're healing yourself Charms can be found by exploring the environments of Hallownest There's a lot of themand this causes the exploration to be rewarding and worth your timeand that's a good thing[/h2]with bosses that will absolutely test your patience The satisfaction once you beat that boss you've been stuck on for the last few hours islike alwaysincomparable to anything else I found the bosses to be surprisingly consistent I expected that there would be your usual irritating and unfair bossesbut I didn't feel like I encountered any of that kind during my entire playthrough Every single boss felt fairwith telegraphed moves and a moveset that wasn't too hard to mastersome of which are easyothers brutally hardrequiring high precision and well-planned moves I'm not one who've got a big knack for platformersso I did sometimes find myself challenged by these sequencesbut they never seemed unfairyou should be familiar with its charming art style It's visually breathtaking and uniquedistinguishing Hollow Knight from any other game  It gives the game a feel of dread while also having a soothingalmost cozy feeling to it I adored the design of the characters; friend and foe alike Instead of featuring humansHollow Knight takes a unique turnhaving bugs serve as the main race of the game The game fully takes advantage of thiswith character designs that can only be described as exceptionally creative Everything is simply so beautifuland it makes you want to stop up just to look at every little detail put into the world Each animation feels precise and just as weighty as it needs to be Everything from the attacks of you and your enemies to the movement looks incredible Combine this with an almost depressingly sad soundtrackincluding a unique theme for almost every area in the gameand you've got a game that nails everything to do with presentationwith their individual enemy typescolor schemes and platforming mechanics All of the areas are intertwoven into one complete worldwith a Metroidvania level design There's multiple ways to access each areaand they're all satisfyingly connected Inspired by the bonfires of Dark Soulsresting at a bench will fully replenish your healthand allow you to equip and unequip your charms These benches are far and few betweenand it's reliefing whenever you find one Some places also require special abilities to be accessed These are often found later in the game off the beaten pathforcing you to take your time exploring carefullyif you want to see everything the game has to offer It's always satisfying when you finally find the ability you needed to get to an unaccesible area in one of the earlier locations you've visited You can also upgrade both your healthamount of SOUL (the essence you use to perform special moves and heal yourself)and the damage of your weapon This is done by finding a specific number of the required item needed to upgrade them Just like charmsthese items are hidden throughout all of Hallownestand are often easy to missthere's still a lot left for me to do I still need to defeat the bosses I missedfully upgrade my equipmentand uncover the remaining secrets of the game I look forward to continuing my journeyas Hollow Knight simply is incredibleHollow Knight doesn't come without some rareyet irritating bugs (Yesthat header pun was intentional) I encountered a bug where moving the joystick would open the map and begin scrolling to the left This happened a total of 2 times throughout a 60-hour playthroughso it was very rarebut still annoying The game also happened to not register my jumps a few timesbut I'm not sure if it was a problem with my controlleror the game These are the only two cases of bugs and glitches I remember They didn't ruin the experience at allbut they were still irritating to encounterI tried experimenting with giving each section a header to make the review easier to read Please let me know what you think[/b]I would appreciate it if you took the time to check out some of my other reviews [url=https://storesteampoweredcom/curator/37051152/]here[/url] Alsofeel free to leave a comment on this review if you want to discuss it or feel like I overlooked something[/i]There aren't many games that have cast a longer shadow over the industry than Dark Soulsand much like what you'll find lurking within them it's been a bit of a curse Too many indie games have been overtuned to provide a similarly punishing experiencenarratives have been undercooked to mimic the subtle storytellingand action has been slowed to a crawl to imitate the methodical combat But some titles have taken the right bits of inspiration and mixed them with their own brew of mechanicsand from just such a concoction you will find Hollow Knight And in many waysthe mix Team Cherry has come up with is a richer taste than what inspired itdarkscary world of bugs It's bugs all the way downyou see; the kingdom of Hallownest was once a great and powerful societyspread across deep warrens beneath the surface But something went wrong long ago and the kingdom fell silent Now only the tiny hamlet of Dirtmouth remains to mark its locationthough recently bugs have found themselves drawn to the lost kingdom in search of something You will follow them down theremeet thembattle them and the unknown denizensand change the fate of the cursed kingdom foreverright? Hollow Knight gets thatand that's one of its first and most prominent achievements The tone this title strikes is both unique and flawlessan unexpected mix of charmdespairhumorand dread You've probably noticed already that your little dude is absolutely adorablenipping along with his little white mask and nail The other bugs nice enough to speak to you are often just as cutebut sometimes have sinister edges to themor in a few cases are downright creepy Friendly critters may crack jokes or help you outwhile others relay ominous portends or warn you of the many dangers in and around Hallownestand each area has a distinct style and atmosphere that hits all the right notes to evoke powerful reactions From the first area of dark caves and ruins you may end up in a lush grotto of vines and creaturesa pleasant change until you realize the water is acidic and every bush may hide terrible dangers Or you could descend into the caverns of potent fungiwith mysteriousbulbous foes that must be approached with great caution Later journeys take you to decaying citiessilent graveyardsbustling coliseumsdesolate wastesand two of the most horrifyingly oppressive places I have ever visited in a video game I'm not kidding hereHollow Knight has topped titles from Half-life to SOMA in crafting locations that give me relentless anxietyfighting battles and dodging traps at a measured pace Team Cherry wisely elected to ignore this aspect of their inspirationinstead making your little knight swiftnimbleand refreshingly responsive The controls here are tightallowing you to execute your dashes and sword swings with ease as you dance around bugs both great and smallairborne and groundedarmed and fanged At no point was I frustrated with the pace at which I could move aboutand the fluid motion made the elaborate and creative battles against bosses and larger enemies all the more enjoyableweapon skills and wall climbing and such But even here there are unique implementationslike one of your earliest powers being essentially unlimited horizontal flight Uncovering this treasure so early on feels incredibly liberating and excitingbut also reveals to you just how important verticality is to the game You can further augment your movement and combat with charms that can extend your sword reachchange how you move when hit or attackingor grant you all sorts of additional effects I will admit a little disappointment here at how essential some charms are over others and how the limited slots for them tend to keep me from experimenting muchthoughlike the rare bug I get where my charged attacks don't workor how spread out the fast travel is That latter one is a bit of a pain in truthbecause the stations used for fast travel tend to be quite far from points of interest You certainly won't be relying on them as much as you would Castlevania warp rooms or Dark Souls bonfire warps The map is another aspect that could be a dragbut honestly I love it You don't fill in new areas of the map until you reach a save pointand to get a map at all you have to locate an amateur cartographer in each area He tends to be near one of the logical entrances and has audio and visual cues to lead you to himso there's a bit of tension in each new locale as you seek him outreally Hallownest isn't just a maze to run aroundit's a functioning world with its own rules and requirements The things Hollow Knight asks you to do are never unreasonable and fit with the dark and unusual tone of the places you visit Nothing is out of place hereand it all works in concert to immerse you in this strange world of bugs and mysticism The characters and locations are far more memorable to me than those of similar gamesin large part because they can be funny or creepy or adorable and still fill their role in a seamless narrative There's a lot to unpack about Hallownestbut instead of just resting on riddles this game makes you WANT to puzzle it outit looks and sounds absolutely breathtaking The hand-drawn aesthetic gives the enemies and environments an extra spark of lifecomplimenting the strong lines and flat colors with impressive animated details The environments in particular are labors of love that bring together careful lineworkbold lightingand rich particle effects to make them feel deep and authentic And the sound design does just as wellwith appropriately subtlemelancholy melodies and impactful effects There's so much going on here that it baffles me how it could all work together so perfectly and yet it doeson and on for easily 20 hours or more Hollow Knight does what few games manage to dotake clear inspiration from classics and find its own way to surpass themand I certainly hope you'll check out more of them at

An absolute steal Better than most $60 games I've purchased"
1,"I'd recommend Killing Floor 2but with reservations. It's a very smoothblasty horde shooter that complementsbut doesn't replace[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/1250]the original game[/url]. It's shiniereschewing the gritty grindhouse aesthetic of Killing Floor 1 for a more sci-fi look and much higher production values. Every character has a unique voice actor now! And while its faster-paced gameplay is perhaps not quite as methodical as KF1it can still be fun. At its bestit does keep true to the Killing Floor spirit.there's a couple problems that have become noticeable in recent times.but I didn't find them much of a problem. [b]I do however think $10 for [u]one[/u] DLC weapon is too steep of a price[/b] and most of the community agrees. At least people who own the DLC weapons share them automatically with other players. Fortunately there are now Armory packs that let you buy weapon bundles for a relatively cheaper price per weaponso this isn't as bad of an issue as it was.such as the shotgun revolver or the explosive boomsticksome of them are rather bizarre: the Field Medic didn't need a railgunnor does the Berserker need a microwave gun.with most of the effort going into new paid DLC weapons. These weapons ship alongside a couple free reskin gunssome new cosmetic skins (usually community-made and a community-made map. If the developer's attention is focused elsewhere right now I can't entirely fault them for thatbut I hope this isn't all that's left for the game's future.[i]especially[/i] if the developers have seen fit to sell paid weapons.but it isn't really that good as a result. A rework has been talked about for a whilebut has not yet materialized.the gun [i]sounds[/i] are rather quiet compared to the first gamewhere they were more visceral and satisfying. Assets are reused on multiple mapswhich would be fine if the game wasn't aiming to be so detailedbecause said assets don't fit every map they're in. Italian warning signs in a Texan embassyDanish banners pleading for help in the middle of Paristhat sort of thing. They also replaced the original menu musicwhich harkened back to KF1's menu musicwith a track that's in my opinion worse.it just needs more attention from its developers to rectify its issues. Whether it will receive that attention is to be seen.Extremely fun and addictive game!But don't realize that Tripwire has always been money hungry.... Look at Kiling Floor 1All the DLC's you need to buy.........You're giving it a bad rating???this purchase is dedicated to my awesome friend (Gerald John Santos who passed away last april of 2018 . me and gerald go way back since high school . sadly he was not able to play this game . we  were planning to buy KF2 as soon as he leaves the hospital but he never did we had a lot of memories on the first game while it pains me to say it but  we pirated KF1 because we were broke  . he said to me since we had a lot of fun lets purchase it on steam to help the developers . this is my second purchase on steam (bought KF1 . RIP GeraldNormally Iâ€™m not that type of guy who makes reviews about gamesbut with Killing Floor 2 Iâ€™m glad to make an exception.about three years ago. I played the original Killing Floor and always enjoyed thatso I didnâ€™t had to think twice when I saw the release Killing Floor 2. Back at that point there were 4 perks to choose from3 official maps to playaround 25 weapons to use and 7 playable characters to choose from.the amount of weapons and playable characters have at least doubled17 new official maps were introduced3 new game modes (HoldoutPvP and Endless modseveral new zeds and bosses made their way into the gameevery now and then there are events (with unique rewards and is there the integration of the steam marketmaking it possible to get weapon skins and/or character customizations. And then I havenâ€™t even mentioned the customcommunity createdcontent that is available.something many other developers could learn from. Even after the full release of the game they keep developing new (and free! content. Big compliment to the people at Tripwire Interactive for creating this masterpiece!it breaks my heart to not recommend this game after these many hours of funbut the devs have decided to put more than just skins behind outrageous paywalls and i'm tired of it. at the time of this reviewowning all dlc weapons cost 100$ for NINE weaponswhich is absolutely ridiculous.As a fan of the original Killing Floor mod and stand alone game-this feels like a pure upgrade.the looks are just sexy and the pure carnage they spit out is amazing.right to the moment when you blow their limbs off.while most other classes don't have that ability...YET.but if i was running from something with a chainsaw for an arm...I'd be running faster. And probably s*****g my pants a little as well.so a very little part of its content is live at the moment.than 100 weapons that are literally as broken as they get. Same goes for maps.I love this game. I really do.you don't have to buy themas you can use them if someone else has the packbut the point still stands. I've tried this new Summer Slideshow updateand the new Glock18C on Gunslinger is extremely overpowered. This gun alone is a pay to win weaponwhich is going to be locked behind a $10 paywall. This is an action that I don't want to stand forand as much as it saddens me to say thismakes me not want to support this game anymore. As much as I love this gamethe Developers are trying to milk what's left of the player base for all they can with small updatesgiving a single map every six months or soand DLC packs that contain near-to-fully pay to win weapons.the guns are amazing to useand cutting down hordes is absolutely exhilarating. Do I recommend you buy the DLC packs? No. They're too overpriced for what you getand what you do get makes the game borderline easy if you know what you're doing. (And considering that all you're doing is shooting zedsgetting to know what you're doing doesn't take you that long at all.Alrightfor those of you who HAVE played KF1I'll get to you a little bit laterpromise.Killing Floor 2 is simply the best wave-based horde FPS game out there.the graphics are nothing to sneeze at and it's challenging. Currently (Early Accessyou get 4 perks (classes to choose from and level up - each with their own playstylepros and cons. Despite clearly being at it's best and based around co-op gameplayyou can also play solo - perfectly viable too as it gets 'rebalanced' for it.we start with an important question. Is it an improvement? Yes!! Yes it is. Remember how going up in difficulty was nothing but numbers? The Zed's HPspeed and damage would increase while the player's money gain and item pickups would decrease? Welpthose days are over (for the most part ;D .the difficulty increase respects the weapons and players - no longer turning Zeds into bullet sponges as they keep the exact same HP as in any lower difficulty. Now the real threat is how they become more aggressive and behave differently (i.e. - jumping and dodging which makes it even harder than the previous game.so no more AFK welding for the Support Specialists! And the levels now go up to 25making it feel a bit less grindy since you level up more often.this game is a must buy for the new players and veterans alike despite still being in Early Access!This one is hardI absolutely adore the original Killing Floorand as my hours might suggestKF2 had me very excited as well.I honestly cannot recommend this game anymoreit brings me no joy to say this at all as I'm very passionate about this franchisebut I feel like it's being done a disservice at this point in time.KF1 had both cosmetics and DLC which were added later in it's lifespanI happily supported both those forms of content as we got free updates with fresh new things in return.one of the devs even gave me a beta key since I sank so many hours in the originalthat was a very special moment I will never forget and the months following the start of early access were greatnew weapons and perks and highly detailed maps to keep the experience fresh.crateskeysrandom cosmetics and artificial rarityI prefer to pay straight up for content I want like in KF1 so I wasn't a fan but I was willing to look past this as updates need to be funded somehow.these were in KF1 as well at the price of 4 weapons for roughly 8 eurosbut in KF2 you get one weapon for 10 eurosjust one.no new assets or anythingjust community made mapsthen the cosmetics which you pay premium price for or gamble for through crates are also community made..pay for the gamepay to open your cosmetic cratespay for new weapons and get very shallow content drops in return.but I disagree with the way it's treated nowadaysI would recommend making up your own mind with different sources and reviewsbut for me it's not worth it anymore.[h1]Return of the Patriarch + Microtransaction thoughts below the review![/h1]and was it worth the wait?it was. [/h1]so I was very excited to see a second one. While I normally do not buy into these early access titleshow could I say no to Tripwire?let's get started.there is currently 4 classes with about 4 weapons for eachas well as a few off-perk weapons like the Katana or the Flamethrower. You can use [b]ANY[/b] weapon at any timejust like the first. The weapon you use will give you points for that classso say you have a medic pistol with a commando rifle? You will be able to rack up points for medic using the healing function whilst using the rifle to earn yourself the commando points. ZED time is still prominantand it is soso satisfying. The visuals will run into a sin-city like lookwith only red standing out amongst the blackgray and white filtered backgrounds and characters. Most weapons have a reasonably large amount of kickbut this further emphasizes the need to have trigger discipline.you can see the obvious. The graphics upgradethe animationsand of course the enviroment designs. Howeverin this game there are tons of small things that all compile into what sets this game apart. You can shoot out lightsblood is persistentand there are [b]TONS[/b] of different animationsboth for players and zeds. Enemies flinch when shotand it varies heavily on what weapon you are using. Shooting a clot in a shoulder with a pistol will only make him flinch a tiny bitbut upping the ante and shooting him in the chest with a rifle will cause him to violently flail backwards and nearly lose his balance. You can shoot off several parts of their bodyhead wounds will start small and slowly wear their flesh away until there is only a meaty remnant that looks nothing like what it once did until that satisfying head pop. Everythingand I mean [b]EVERYTHING[/b] feels much more alive and less clunky than the firstfrom the reload animations to the death animations.it's hard to say. You will get 4 perks and limited weaponrywith only 3 maps to spare. As it standthere is much more content in the first game. Howeverif you buy into the early accessyou are not only supporting Tripwirebut you give yourself a chance to watch this game bloom. You get to experience a game that has lots of love in itand you can see that Tripwire cares about this game. Yesit has bugs. Yesthere are glitches. Nothere is no buyers remorse from me. If you expect a full gameyou may want to lower your expectationsbut this is certainly not a bad way to start off a early access game.including a female one. These characters are all uniqueand have their own voices. They will talk a [b]LOT[/b]and this is not a bad thing. They will call out ammokevlarand weapons. They will talk to each other with idle banter whilst you're shopping at the traderand they will also pitch a few jokes. There are a few stereotypesbut it adds to the quirky and goofy traits they all haveand they even have things you can add to themlike gas masks or face masks. You can also change their clothing colourhair colour and a few other neat features absent in the first game.and so far I don't see much of a difference between them. Howeverthey behave much like the same gamespare their animations. They will oftentimes hold you just as that gorefast is chargingor the fleshpound is roid raging. The gorefasts move fastand are tall hulks that you do NOT want to get close to. The siren is short and blends into groupsoften hiding behind clots or bigger enemies. The stalkers are nearly invisibleand are disturbingly quiet. The skrakes and fleshpounds make roars when they enterthat strikes that scene of ""oh no"" into you. And the final boss is HARD. This game makes the zeds feel more alive than everand I love every second of it.this game is a newborn. It shows promiseand it has loving parentsas Tripwire has shown itself to be. I can see this game becoming just asif not moreof a classic game as the first one. The game feels much smoothermuch faster pacedand it has a few moments in it that will make you jump and scream when that clot turns you around and holds onto you as a fleshpound is nearing you. I would highly reccomend thiseven to those who like to wait to see if early access games grow at all. Time will tellbut I firmly believe in Tripwire.at it's current statewith the only thing bringing it down is the lack of weaponry and classeshowever both of which have been promised to have their numbers bolsteredso this review will be updated as the game grows.this has been interesting. A new classan in-game storeskins and crates all kind of thrown all in. Maybe I haven't been playing this game enoughbut I'm going to change that. Sowith that saidlet's move on.making his kill potential relatively lower than Hans. He still uses his signature stimpacks to survive after a certain amount of damage is takenand still only has three. It seems with each one he takesthe health he gains is less than beforewhich doesn't make him insanely strong. Howeverhe cloaks a lot more often than the Patriarch from the first gamebut is also extremely loud when he movesmaking it relatively easy to pinpoint a location as a non-commando player. Furthermorejust because he is easierdoes not mean he is not fun to play against. I have had countless laughs against the Patriatch with friends from his sometimes erratic behavior and his obsession with getting right in your face before unlcoaking. I believe he could do with some buffingthoughto bring him a bit more onto terms with Hans.what more could you want? The Gunslinger has a wide array of weaponsthough this is mostly because every weapon he can buy has a dial wield function. Two deaglesrevolversor 1911's? Ohthe choices. He is a relatively mobile class that enjoys the benefits of being able to harvest weak zeds very easilyand using the stacks he earns from farming these smaller zeds to tackle the bigger ones with tons of damage. Plus he has style in his reloadsso go give him a try already.Tripwire has done the sameand this community outcry has been quite large. Howeverlet us remember that the first game also had similar marketingjust in the form of DLC packs for skins. Skinspeopleskins that don't give any stat boosts or mobilityjust make your character stand out a bit more. While I do agree that releasing these micros in the aftermath of the Payday incidentI do not believe that we should be reacting as harshly as we are. Let us remember that Tripwire has yet to release any weapons OR characters that we have had to pay forand that they have done this practice in the past with the first Killing Floor.+ Improved FPS mechanics from RO2 onwardseven this small selection of KF2's new features were everything I could have wanted from a KF sequel and more.I very much enjoyed the first iteration of this game. The second version however just doesn't quite feel the same.Please reconsider choosing Hell on Earth difficulty if you are Level 2.it's all dosh?Maybe the best $10 bucks ever spent on STEAM (on salebut in this case I'd say BUY THIS GAME.(as it was for me you may find it a welcome release from so many of the grindy games that are popular today.or idiots talking smackno problem just randomly get into any server and play this for 15 minutes.The Floor still posses no threat and thus cannot be killedNeeds more goreand bodies. Luckily there's a thing for that.You can tell the developers care heavily for the community when they add physics collision to the wads of dosh you throw around so that you can make a literal pile of money.Killing Floor 2 is an improvement on a timeless classic. If you thought KF1 was a fun experienceyou'll only have more fun with this one. If you haven't played the first oneyou don't need to; KF2 is a completely standalone game and improves in every way. The first Killing Floor was originally a mod for Unreal Tournament 2004and it definitely shows via clunkiness. That's all nonexistent in this game - Tripwire did a great job with making KF2 feel like it's a standalone game.mind you in a game of 1-6 players. The classes feel well balanced (aside from the insanely strong Berserker and fun to use. Gameplay is really fluidshooting and meleeing feels great and it gets really difficult and strategical really fast. It's unlike other zombie horde gameswhich I don't usually likebut KF2 is different.all with their own tiny little backstories and personalitieslike in KF1. Level design is great and there's a lot of mapseven more when you include Steam Workshop integration and modding. To top it all offthe game features an amazing metal soundtrack from various artists to headbang to while playing.so I'm glad to see that Tripwire decided to stray away from those here. You buy the gameyou get everything along with free future updates. Killing Floor 2 does have microtransactions with casesskins and cosmeticswhich I don't really care aboutbut they're never in the way and I don't mind them that much.which is cool. It actually takes a lot of effort to get bored of shooting zeds in Killing Floorwhich is something you can't say from most other horde mode games. I'd still recommend the first Killing Floor if you're looking for a more difficult and intense experiencealthough both games are far from casual.I'm a simple man.Alrightafter about 102 hours of playing this gamelet me write a review.Tripwire failed to listen to the communities complaints and suggestionsthe game was horrendously unbalancedand holy shit was there no content. Not to mention they'd delete any negative criticism of their game from their forums.and now equipped with a full team againseem to be making a much more polished game. I write this review after playing the new Beta patch that introduced the SWAT perk and various reworks of existing perksas wellto my surpriseadded additional weapons to pre-existing perks (Such as the Katana being added to berseker and the M16 added to Demo. After this patch I find myself not being able to get enough Killing Floor 2 in my blood stream. Maybe it's the excitement for my fancy new in game Canadian ball capor maybe it's that the game actually FEELS ENJOYABLE now. I used to compare Tripwire to the guys who made District 9: First they made a ruggetlow budget movie that was really goodand people loved it (District 9and they got so much money from that that they said they were going to make another great moviewhich ended up flopping because in reality they have no idea what they're doing (Elysium. Obviously this analogy is no longer trueand I think if you played the game in its current state you'd agree. I feeland I hopethat it's only going to get better from here.let me hit you with a few final pros and cons.fast paced Co-Op gameplayperksand hopefully one day weaponsaudio is fantasticget you pumped soundtrack (Who doesn't love a  bit of Demon Hunter?"
1,"I played the precursor to this game copied almost identicallyShop Heroeson and off for several years This game is nearly a carbon copybut a more polishedsimplified versionand a couple hundred dollars It was an immensely fun bit of nostalgia I don't regret my purchasesthough I am quitting today I had two weeks of funand items break frequently Expensive gear can take days or weeks of farming to obtain So basicallyif you are f2p u must run all your dungeons in junk disposable gearmeaning you will progress far more slowly And who on earth wants to play a game where you can never use the good gear you craft So I paid my $10 so I could play the gamecrossbowsand wands are behind a $50 paywall These items are all noticeably more powerful than the free recipesso it gives you an edge in combatbut more importantly economicallyand you could always go back and buy them later Shop titans apparently adds new p2w blueprints twice each month So there's $20 each pack Thenif you buy the packyou get $80 worth of flashback pack offers And againyou must buy them or the blueprints are gone forever A few packs give best in slot gear Having logged thousands of hoursI don't think I made any mistakes But doing so cost me $200 Then 5 days later I got my second pack offerwhich would inevitably be followed by another $80 of offers and I quitand of course sell for very high prices due to raritybut if you are going to require a $10 monthly feeit should not be necessary to also have extremely greedy p2w packs as well World of Warcraft offers an immense amount of content for $15 per month Shop Titan's does not provide value for your money at allthis is permanent They can churn out two new blue print packs a monthbut the game doesn't even feel finished yet There's no way to even sort your damned inventoryand realising I will probably have to spend $1000 in the 1st year just to get all the old packs is ridiculous And then I'll continue to be up for $60 a month in new packs each monthand the $10 monthly fee indefinitelyand this game will not thrive Disappointed This is shop heroes version 2 with ridiculously increased paywalls And it's not like the rng ability system on heroes is any fun eitheras you can simply spend gems to reroll each attribute until you get the perfect herocompletely removing the rng Notice the 12 carbon copy ninja's with equal stats on top of the leader board This costs 20k gems or $200 if you paid for it in cash Sorry but if the game is built around the rng attribute systemit should not be possible to circumvent the rng simply by paying real money/premium currency Allowing players to cookie cutter build the perfect characters with enough gems takes any of the fun/accomplishment in obtaining strong heroes That you would get it was never in doubt it is just a matter of time or in game grindingyou could buy any of the old packs any time I was content buying what i saw a use forand let the rest be Forcing players to buy every pack because you never know for certain if they may become useful or meta in the future is not at all funlimited tiny mobile game One that I am quite attached to But the way this has been setup like a skinner box to try to milk extra money out removes any and all of the funwith the addition of dozens more pay packs Thank you for a fun 2 weeks of nostalgia But every time I think just maybe this mobile game will be different it never isWho'd have thought itI assumed this was just a time management type gamequite like those But incredibly they have brought a mobile gaming experience to PC Time gated actionsbuying gemsrolling for prizespaid for perk bundles and even a Â£10 monthly subscription to get all the perksgod help us if it start moving into the PC platform as wellUntil recently I would have recommended this game to people due to what seemed to be a relatively unique concept and a lot of fun idle game mechanics The patch on April 7th2021 introduced a new content tier into the game that destroyed any fun of the shop progression mechanics By adding multiple stages of prerequisite crafts to every item in the new tier they effectively added hours of RNG dependent crafting that can only be shortened by being lucky or paying large amounts of money to the developers For years there were premium items that you had to pay to be able to get the crafting blueprintsbut if you waited long enough there were other ways to acquire themand ultimately you could complete all content without them Now with every item in the new tier requiring a precraftand those precrafts requiring precrafts it more accurately depicts modern supply chain mechanics that real life businesses have to deal with except that what is accurate in that regard does not make for as fun of a game with the multiple hours involved in each craft that has multiple stages I really used to enjoy this gamebut the devs decided to go in a different direction that I quite simply cannot recommend to people[strike]This is an awesome game![/strike] ~ SorryI had a moment of insanitylet me correct that statement: This is everything wrong with microtransactions in the most obnoxious possible wayI'm going to be overly generous and say I might even consider it at $20 just to account for modern inflation But for that price I expect a complete game Heck they could have slapped a $40 price tag on this and I'd have only mildly scoffed while suggesting you wait for a sale price but still managed to leave a recommended tag on it The problem is they aren't charging a price anywhere near what any other game will costthey are above it by quite a wide marginas do several othershonestly I could list you dozens) that fill this niche and all in the $5 to $20 price range This was (for a time) a very popular genre back in the 2000 to 2010 era with dozens of games in the genre that are ""complete"" and charge a reasonable one-time costbut you'll have one hand tied behind your back and someone will walk over and slap you in the face with a fish every once in a while just to remind you what a peasant you arebut maybe tolerate it if it's not taking too much away from the core game play; but this? **** YOU **** YOUR HORSE **** YOUR MOTHERand it's a one time use so $10 againand againand again and nopenone of these single use things were included with your $120 a year subscriptionthat was just to be allowed to use some basic expected featuresotherwise  you craft it againwhich is a wait timerand since you have a lock on the number of things you can craft you either craft for sale (which is what the game is supposed to be aboutrunning your shop) or you craft for your team of champions to use (which is how you get special items to craft other items to sell by sending champions out on missions)but the interplay between these  features is just trading one set of wait timers for another all leading to paywall after grinding paywallthis game has itmany of these costs are slightly hidden If you look through the menu of what you can buy at any one timeyou might add it up and try to justify $10 here$20 theremaybe that $100 cost one time will get you ""everything"" ? Nopeevery few days you'll find out there's another $20 to $30 thing to buy on top of your $120 subscription and your endless wave of ""would you like to spend gems to go faster"" ? That you could easily just keep spending real money on I've put many hours into this just trying to find some package deal that would justify a one time purchase that would justify its price tag and everything is just temporary boosts or minimal upgrades with no end in sight for what else needs to be purchasedcrafting quesupgrade quesyou can't set up a chain of things and then wait for them to finish; everything requires 1 and wait and then activate the next in line And why can't you upgrade more than one thing at a time? Even if they all have wait timersit's just one I'll tell you why: it's intentionally designed to induce just enough frustration that you would like to speed up the process just a little so you can start the next one Wellthat will cost you real money and there's no end in sight for how many times it will recur this loop It's very much the same addiction model used on gamblers to suck every penny from their pocket A constructed amount of minimal fun in a tight loop of mild frustration that can be alleviated for just a small costbut a small recurring cost with no endif you have $100's ($1000's ?) of dollars of disposable income that you're willing to simply throw away on a tycoon game maybe you'll find yourself having $10 worth of funwould you consider following my curator page?[/url]I'm lvl 23 as of posting this review  I will update this review as necessary when I progress furthermax worker levelsresource collection speedsetc to improve gameplay for all in guild)earnable Fortune Zone (Spin the wheel) prizes for helpful items to be boughtPutting aside the $50 paywall to unlock all the base content in the gamethe additional paid packs to unlock more contentand the toxic community morons who claim that none of that existsthis game is pay to win at just about every turn EVERY SINGLE dungeon run shows you additional loot that you cannot earn unless you pay a $10 a month subscription feealong with ascension rewards and event dungeon loot The best free to play games offer paid currency purely for cosmetics or to expedite progression and not lock core content Shop Titans is not one of themeither way you will also run into frustrating UI issues that you can't even pay to fix The most obnoxious part of the game is that you are spammed every time you create an item of green or greater quality and the game asks you to spend gemsthe premium currencyto upgrade it This is absolutely useless and frustratingly moronic for just about 99% of the items in the bloody game which you would NEVER WASTE hundreds of gems upgrading for hardly any goldand makes mass producing cheap items a royal PITA after a while Againyou cannot even pay to fix this issue I might be able to recommend this game if they added a quality of life option to disable ""quality craft popups"" below a certain item tier which is the way it SHOULD bethe devs need to at least give players the option to get the two paywalled workers/buildings in the base game with diamondsand an option to hide the paywalled bonus loot you're shown after every dungeon but have to pay freaking $10 a month to get Not getting the extra loot is one thingeven worse is it's bloody ludicrous having to see subscription-paywalled loot every quest clear screen Those two things alone are about as scummy as it gets with an F2P gameI actually love this gamegot addicted really fasttill I hit a pay wall Not being able to unlock Evelyn and the other one with in game meansjust sucked I dont mind all the other cash shop thingshell its a mobile type game anywayits expected But actually locking content behind a pay wall and a super expensive one at thatjust sucked all the joy out of the game[h1] Monetization [/h1]99[/b] and here is why:you craft for the most part The basic resources are generated passively; additional necessary crafting materials come from dungeons You'll have a growing number of npc's you have to equip and send to the dungeons in a time-gated browser game Their equipment has a chance to break and [u]you'll only have the option to repair it using gold when you have the monthly sub[/u] -

and i DO NOT recommend itbut just enough to make you want to spend money on it I've spent just a few bucks and i regret itI've been playing this since about a month after releasecurrently L75 Probably put over 8k hours into it before they released a Steam version 85B net worth/70B invested with almost no gemvesting The aforementioned isn't meant to be braggingjust an illustration of how much I used to enjoy this game Now it sucksnot because of the game itself but if you need a non-bot customer service rep good luck with that Bought 16500 gems via Steam 3 weeks agogot market banned for some dumb reason 2 weeks after that (probably because Steam store glitched and I had to buy it twice to get it oncebut was only charged once so thought all was fineguess not)and still market banned now No market = have to craft and farm everything yourselfnot even half as fun and progress slows to a crawl Sent 2 support tickets asking them why 3-4 days aparthave yet to get a response from either of themautomated or otherwise As is you are better off investing your life in something elseunless you want to just kill a few hours before moving on (as is the case with just about every ""free"" game)  My New Year's resolution is to quit wasting time and money on games with microtransactions Thank you Kabam for the inspirationPay2Win gameand some crafters are only unlocked when paid with real moneyWith 500+ hrs on shop heroes I was really looking forward to this gameits a much better looking game and gave me the impression that overall it was just a better version but barely an hr in and im hating it alreadyat every chance you are forced into posistions where you are fed microtransactions (""hey here's a chest but no keydont worry lets spend gems"" 3 mins into the game) you cant trade in gems until you have spent 600 gems on cosmetics etc and everything feels restricted and guided down just one pathto get you to part with your money and if you have any hope of doing well in this game and want to enjoy the cool stuff you will need plenty of itthe established players that are Â£1000's deep into the game need as many fresh players as possible to validate thier purchases and will never give you the truth of the gameyou are already joining people with years behind them yet need to spend loads more and quickly to catch upthe community and just about every person out there a favor and avoid games like these so we can get back to games that actually have value and dont treat you like a cash cow to be exploitedsimply put it blocks you from speeding up your ranking progress or enjoying the game at a quicker pace whilst also providing experienced players with cheap precrafts for gold which would otherwise be sold for gems due to demandessentially brickwalling the player the either buy gems or wait until lvl 30 roughly before you can earn enough for free which will all be wasted on time saving itemsI like this game but there's one main reason I'm rating it downit seems that legendary fusions (which you have to pay real money to have regular access to)which claim to have a success rate of 50%are not actually random  I've failed on them far too many times in a row for it to be truly random based on my knowledge of C# and other languages as well as the facts of probabilities  Alsousers on their forums have reported failing more than 10 times in a rowwhich is EXTREMELY unlikely on an untampered 50% roll  They must be employing some kind of custom random-generation class which actually lowers the effective success rate  (The chance of failing ten times in a row on a legit 50% chance is 0048828125%)the game is pretty fun if you're looking for something idle-oriented (without a lot of action) and which doesn't require constant attention  It could use more customization options for the charactersbut the item system is well thought out and the hero/champion system is a good diversion when you aren't crafting or trading"
1,"I've lived entire lives in this game  Braved bitter winters  Sorted and labeled crates of canned foodwondering how long it would last me  Tended crops and cursed the misfortune of plant disease  Fractured my leg and holed up in the corner of some dilapidated warehouse dying of thirst since I lacked the speed to get home safely  I've lived a thousand lives and felt the touch of death so many timesnow I'm only surprised when it doesn't come swiftlynoit's a sweet release  Make no mistakeI've survived for a long timebuilt impregnable safehouses with self-sustaining cropshigh above where any zombie could reach  But that is simply a different kind of deathdeath in the form of boredombut it is a death all the same  It makes sense thoughdoesn't it?  You are the last person on Earththe world is filled with endless zombiesthere is no happy ending to all of thisthe point is to create your own talemake a snapshot of experiences that are memorable  This game is really just an analogy for life and deathcompressed into a few hours at a timeand how you choose to spend your time reflects on your personality  How will you keep death at bay?  Will you build wallswill you hidewill you run as far away as you canor will you pick up an axe and try to fight it?  It doesn't matterdeath will find you in the endbut it will be a hell of a journey5 days into a rungood gear and foodhad me a working fuelled car My guy gets depressed from boredom I'm sorry mate? Since when does your video game character get sick of existing? I went to swing a bat at a zombiebut due to my crap mood he swung too slowzombie jumped me and bit me I turned within a few days My character literally couldn't be bothered to save his own life 11/10Okay so here goes  I am a State Level Emergency Managerand I saw this game when I was recovering after a hospital stay  What they say they deliver not only is it a great game one of the only truly open ended games I have ever seen   It also follows pretty much what would happen theoretically during a wide scale Emergency Eventdrop some Mods onto it and the entire game gets a depth that I have not seen in other franchises  I have well over 2000 hours played on this gamebut it needs to be said if you like a thought provoking gamewhere you will pay dearly for complaceny then this is the game for you  If you want a mindless game set in the zombie world then this is not the game for youala the Oregon Traill game in the early 90sdont make them again and you live longeri spent too long in this game No regretsOne or two years agoI'm not sure whyI bought this gameprobably thinking ""that's a team of devs whose project I want to get behind!""thinking it was unplayable and would most

some gas stationquite possibly the greatest game I've ever playedwe need 41 online modeReviewing this game feels like a daunting task  There's so much I want to saythat I could write pages and pages on this gamebecause they enable lazy developers You don't need a storybut if you want one you can just rip off any established zombie lore Your AI can be barebones with zombies that just path to the nearest player and attack once they get into melee The lack of sophistication isn't a bugit's a featureand so what if the path-finding is easily exploited and there's no strategy at all  They're zombies They're supposed to be stupidsend wave after wave of zombies at the player and throw your shitty game up on Steam and hope someone buys it for $250 because they want trading cardsand the fact that it accomplishes that in an isometric 3rd person perspective is nothing short of amazing The way it limits your view to the direction your character is looking is done incredibly welland it even plays with that system a bitadjusting the viewing angle depending on your character's traitshealthand the visual conditionshow long they remember the player after you leave their line of sightand how fast they move  Some zombies are smart enough to path around obstacles and some will bang on the closed side of a double door even if the other door is open  This creates opportunities for the player to split up zombies by abusing these differences If there's a pack of 6 zombies you can slowly creep to them until a few notice youthen retreat and dispatch just those  Or if you have a big horde on youyou can run them through a building so some of them get stuck on windows and furnituregiving you spacing to take them out in smaller groupsbut rather a decision making based combat system  Wherewhen and how you fight matters a lot more than which weapon you have or what your character's stats are  An obese weakling can kill 100s of zombies under the right circumstances and a god-like character with max stats can die to a single zombie sneaking up behind themdistractionand discretion is the best way to surviveyou're just going house to housekilling zombies and raiding pantries for food  Eventually you master the combat system and positioning You'll live long enough for your character to experience exhaustion and fatigue and eventually you'll learn to master those systemstoo You'll move onto base building and die to the helicopter the first time it happens Then you live long enough for water and power to fail Then you get to the point where all the easy places to loot are looted and you have to decide to try riskier placesor perhaps work on making your own food via farmingforagingor trapping Survive that longand the season will begin to change and with itnew problems Long term nutrition starts to matteras even if you are satisfying your character's hungerthey may be losing weight every day and in danger of wasting away Then winter hits Survive the winter and you can survive anythingno matter how long it takes?  It's up to you  Just don't get too cockybecause no matter what you've built and how many zombies you've killedyou are always 1 bite away from joining their ranksthere's more  Try challenge runs with negative traitsor crank up zombie numbers and infection chancesor even enable sprintersif you dare Dive into steam workshop and download mods to change the game or add new content There's always another challenge to take onthe beta 41 version of the game (the version you should be playing) only has remote couch co-op  This will eventually changehoweverand when it does multiplayer will open up a whole new dimensionProject Zomboid is a superb gamebut I'd be remiss if I didn't point out some flaws  The game is still very much in early access development There are a few things about it and it's systems that are a bit wonky as a result  A big criticism is how slow skills levelalthough in custom sandbox mode you can add an xp multiplier if you want towhereas electronics feels almost forgotten and there's very little reason to advance in it There aren't any huge bugs I've encounteredbut sometimes the interface can be a bit odd  There's also a lack of polish sometimeslike for example there are no animations for sitting in a chair or sleeping in a bedthe rest of the game is so funso satisfying that it's easy to overlook these thingsespecially because this is a $15 game by an indy developernot a $60 +micro-transactions AAA titleDont get me wrong its enjoyable when you play it alone too but I can trade a kidney and a leg for getting a mp updateKilled a zombie with a

alter the current games play style No longer will we be ""limited"" to just raiding MuldraughWest Pointor the ""New(ish)"" Mall area/recent expansionwhich to be perfectly honest is quite a bit of looting to begin with It honestly necessitates a new Safehouse/Fortress for each area as carrying all the stuff you find between forts would be kind of pointlessas the current map is that big(map

on a horde or twojust swinging away till either the zombies are deadmy weapon breaksor i have to run and get bandaged upmaybe have my character drink some bleach if the zombies made me bleed Consequentlyi rarely have a character last much beyond a month in the game But that's the fun of the gameit lulls you into thinking that you are ""Too Good"" for the mere zombies to hurtuntil they get you surrounded and you remember that you swore to yourself last timethat you would not let that happen againtry it out for yourself and see how well you do Just remember the words on the screen at the beginning of the game ""This is how you died""which brought in a Medical Overhaul I have fallen out of windows and broken feet and legsrequiring me to bandage and splint the injuries then just wait for it to heal I have cut my hands climbing in thru broken windowshad to get some tweezers and pry out the lodged glass before bandagingpossibly having to stitch the wound Been scratched and bitten by zombiesrequiring me to disinfectstitch/bandage the wound and hope i did not get infectedbefore i can do any of thisi had to locate the needed medical equipment at various locations on the map With the new overhaulit's even possible to bleed out from a bad wound if i cannot locate some band aidsbandagesor even some sheets or clothing to rip up for use as a low grade bandage One nice thing is the ability to clean a bandage for reuseevery new build the Devs come up with just continues to draw you in and add more game immersionand they have plans to ""adjust"" the game to make it harder for you to survive a lengthy amount of timewith more and more Game Server companies starting to add PZ to their inventory  And i just realized i did not mention some of the other new things in the latest Build (303) We have more Sandbox options available when starting a new gameincluding adjusting how often Zombies respawnwhether or not you want random loot respawn and it's frequencythe incredible Erosion mod has been integrated into the base game which literally is Mother Nature taking over the mapvines growing up buildingscracks in pavementtrees losing their leaves as fall approaches then regrowing as spring comesbushes and trees growing in places where we Humans would remove themSNOWand so much more that i just cannot think of right nowI don't want this to be a 10000 word review so i'll stop here but as beforeif you would like to see some gameplay there are plenty of videos on youtube Orcheck on Twitch  and catch a live stream Either wayI hope you enjoy what you see and you too join the Zomboid communitystill enjoying most of it damn zombiesand yes you can indeed rally a 2 door sports car at about 120MPH head on into a tree to smash a zombiebut yer gonna die too the map has

1,"I once lost all my colonists in Surviving Mars. Two hundred men and womenadultschildren and elderly. They had pets. It was due to an unfortunate chain of events and gross incompetence on my part. It felt nowhere as bad as when I lost all my 12 beavers to a drought.workingand good. It deserves to be enjoyed and its developers deserve to be supported.My original beaver colony was doing absolutely amazing. Was up to 96 beaversproducing metalbooksalmost everything in the tech tree. Several droughts had come and gone but I barely noticed them with how well my dam and water supplies held out. And then the big one camea drought that lasted just a little bit longer than I was ready for. The dam dried up. The water stopped pumping. My little guys were drinking from the reserves until thosetooran dry. A day and a half before the drought ended beavers started to die from dehydration. As some died it made room in the housesand they started having babies. The next generation ready to take over after the drought. But it went for just too long. In the last hours of the droughtmy last adult beaver died off. The river came back though! And the 8 babies had survived it. The ran around like crazyplaying on the carouselchasing each other down the streets. Working up a big thirst. Butnone of them were big enough to pump the water. They were growing fast thoughwould they become adults in time?? As the day went the dehydration started to hit them hard and the first died off. The others ran around in a panicworking up a bigger and bigger thirstuntil they too fell to the groundlicking the sand for any little bit of moisture it might have. As night fell on the second day after the drought the town lay still and quiet. No one at the campfiresno one in the rooftop terracesand no one working the pumps in the pump houses...TLDR:so there are issues related to it.as it isit is rather a zen-like gamewhere you just happily build loads of housing complexesthat may not be efficientbut they just look nice.and there aren't many. I really hope more are getting added later in the developmentbecause I see huge potential for deeper gameplay.called districts. Then make them transfer stuff and pop from one to another. This is nicebut having to research the ""distribution"" outpost and the ""receiving"" outpost separatelyseems like a mistakeas these buildings are absolutely useless without one another and that's very telling of the current state of Research in the game - redundant and frustrating. I am pretty sure I've seen the dev response somewhere mentioning Research is getting a reworkbutI'd just straight up disable it until the rework is done. As it stands nowthe research is just an extra layer that makes you build things in a way you don't likeuntil you get things like platforms and bridgestaking away A LOT of the joy you could've had in the early to mid game. Research is done through a single buildingyou're expected to spam. It requires no resources and no energyjust one beaver... and that feels pretty dumb and unsatisfying. I'd expect research to open up ways in which you can certain thingslikewindmills instead of water wheels. I get that you don't need a windmillbut it may be situationally better buildinghence available though research. What I don't get is locking simple wooden platformsand thing like the Forester building behind research. You absolutely need foresterand you can also pretty much softlock yourself if you kill all the forests without having built the foresterwhich seems pretty stupid. Wooden platforms and stairs are essential to any ""fun"" you can get from buildingso those should be absolutely available from get go. + You've already got mechanics that stop you from building ""advanced"" buildings to start withsuch asdifferent materials. Research as it is currently implemented is just redundantunsatisfying and frustrating. It's also easy to tell there wasn't much development time spent on its current implementation.but there are no swimming or underwater mechanics... there's even a hamster wheel as power source. I really hope they add some beaver mechanics related to water beside few different types of dams.just let me (unless it's limited by the engine or smth. The outpost mechanics would flourish in huge worlds.they're easily beat by a few dams and water storage spam.damaging dams if the flotsam is travelling at higher speed - need for flotsam breakers/water speed control - there needs to be a punishment for slowing the water too much - water Power wheels need to scale with water flow speedcurrent implementationwhere you put water power wheel into stale water and somehow it generates 180pwr seems very off.other conservation methods. Spoiled food = fertilizer - extra production in future as balance set off (similar effect to beehiveFlag with ""x"" storage for fertilizereffect in ""y"" radius.""spoil rate"" = 1 - (""amount of adjacent ground""*0.05 + ""roof surface""*0.05 - ""warehouse surface""*0.05; ""time until spoiled"" = ""given food endurance""-""spoil rate""*timeif (""time until spoiled""<=0 then ""given food"" = ""fertilizer"".example: addition of water vegetation as food source - vegetation grows on the riverbed - potential for purposeful drying of parts of the riverto collect loads of food from the riverbed quicklyor long term diving posts (essentially a Flag next to river. Water vegetation would just grow on the riverbed over timemaking it yet another food source.but the housing would be very resource heavy.requiring powermultiple beaversand research specific resources. Example: If you wanna research a windmillyou need a bunch of cogsplanks and woodand X amount of timewhich can be divided by the amount of hamsters working in the particular lab - butmore hamsters working means more Power required... The building would need to *ding* once research was doneor no research was in progressrequiring extra input from the player by making him choose the next research. But I don't see that as an issueas the game isn't exactly micro heavy. They could probably slap that on top of a research treebut reallythey need more buildings for that sort of thing70% of the buildings available should be considered essential and unlocked from the start... so... like... but I am fine with any other solution that doesn't completely suck as well though.I'd like to list a couple of extra suggestionsas it seems about right. What doesn't seem about right is the lack of compensation techniques.minimum 0 (no windwithin 400 power required system. As it is nowyou might as well end up with 60% efficiency due to lows and zeroeseven though your system provides more than enough average power. Energy produced outside of working hours is also getting wasted.you could just make mid sizedhollow wooden wheels filled with water (with a piece of plywood across the insidesso you wouldn't get the water spinning independently to the wheel and lose a bunch of kinetic energy to fluid friction. These would work essentially as any other power consuming buildingwith a twistbeingit only consumes Power when the system has extraand the other way around - being a power source when the system lacks powerwhile having given max power stored capacity and max power provided stats. These stats could be realistically given by max tolerated stresses inside the transmissions and mechanics of the ""inertia battery"". Switching between modes could be done by centrifugal transmissions - soit should make sense.hence giving them water consumption and making them more interactive.that might help the water gameplayare water pumps and pipes. Think they would be fun.//but very much a work in progressrather short on content. Meaning it's not really a complex strategy game (yet. Butthe mechanics and graphics currently present in the game (beside Researchwhich should be temporarily disabled until reworkedimoare solid enough to make it a fun zen gamewhere you just build stuff and enjoy looking at the beavers go ham. I see great potential on what it could becomeI hope the devs won't disappoint. So far it seems like they've been very responsive to the feedbackwhich is also one of the main reasons I've bought into this early access.You can unlock the camera and zoom in really close to the ground to see the cute little beavers carrying stuff on their backs.This is a game about a beaver society. It is my civic duty as a Canadian to buy and play it. It is good.I bought Timberborn as soon as it came outlost my mind on how cute the Beavers areand suddenly I've now been playing for over 21 hours in a single session.but also challengingwhile at the same time offering a lot of interesting options to manage risks and systems collapseeventually I'm going to need to sleepbut over 500 beavers need my guiding hand to expand ever furtherstill not sleptI've crawled the fps down to 7 when at triple speedwhich means I'm winning. Over 500 beavers5 districtslooking at a 6th and 7th soon.I've churned the ground to make deep trenches irrigating the vast majority of the barren landsand run power using great lengths of cranks and shafts spanning huge distances in total.because my waterway Management at this point has  enabled me to supply the land with water even through the 7-10 day droughts the game now throws at mebut with some extra clever additions that do nothing but add to the game :D the game will punish youbut you will succeedand by Lumber make your mark!10/10even in EA I approve :DIt took me 10 hours to realize that the beavers can swim.I kept spending lots of lumber on bridges and dams specifically to get across shallow pools of wateronly to realize hours later that beavers canin factswim.Canadians. I'm from California.It's difficult not to draw parallels to Banished when reviewing Timberborn. It is clear that the developers have taken significant inspiration from the older game: everything from game mechanics to the difficulty curve are nearly identical. The way both games have you balancing your resources are very similarhaving to prioritize between the basic needs of your people and the gathering and replanting of resources so your community can expand. Timberborn does add one additional layer to the gameplay with mechanics centered around the river: stray more than a few blocks from its borders and the land turns arid and deadunable to support the plants you need to survive. This is used as a central resource in Timberborn: use up all the green area for plants and you won't have anywhere to place your water wheels to extract power from the flowing water. Fail to prepare for the dry season and your society will collapse as the riverand the land around itdries up. Where Banished had you stocking up for the winterTimberborn has you stocking up and building dams to buy precious days of fertile land into the dry season.having been just released into early access is already almost as polished and complete as Banished was near its end. While it only took me around 6 hours to explore to the end of the current tech treethe base game and the underlying mechanics are incredibly solid and bug free for being so early in the developmentand the content that is here is already well worth the price. I am excited to see where the devs take Timberborn; give it time and it will become an incredible colony sim.This is what canada actually looks likeTimberborn stands out from other survival settlement builders through its use of water management (and its villagers being beaversof course. By which I mean it is necessary as part of the core mechanics to build and maintain dams in order to control the flow of waterat first in order to survive the seasonal droughtsbut then also to begin to divert river flow to bring life to dry areas of the game map.as it handles pretty nicely and whilst not fully without issueis very well polished. But past the early gamethere's not a whole lot to do.it speed up researchyou'll want a larger colony; and to maintain a larger colonyyou're going to want to research more advanced conceptswhich are going to require new resources as you bridge the tiers. And to be fairthere are a decent number of upgrades available through research. Enough that the core game is certainly there and in a complete statebut... ideally there could be more. Certainlythere is more to it than Banishedwhich is the typical yardstick people measure this kind of game against these days.you've built a huge lake that'll retain water throughout even the longest of droughts without risking the death of your crops. Now what? There isn't much incentive to expandexcept maybe to scavenge for scrap metal. You can easily reach the end of the research tree on maybe 3 districts alone. And when you doyou'll be left thinking ""now what?"".great core ideas and a robust game engine... but not a whole lot to do after a fact. Yesthere are multiple factionsbut right now there are only 2 of thoseand whilst they do play differently enough it does increase increase replayabilitythey're not different enough to make that second playthrough interesting once you've gotten used to those differences. It is my hope that Timberborn will fix these aspects before it leaves Early Accessbecause it really does have the potential to stand up there with games like the Anno series. It just needs some fleshing out to get there.Honestly.. Went into this pretty.. well actually blind entirely and I must sayHoly Crap this is a good game.. Extremely fun just to start over and over until you get that good start that you want. You should give this a shot if you love city builders. This honestly so off guard I just simply had to write a review to share my thoughts on what is currently an extremely enjoyable experience.Thank you for your time - have a great day!I am completely in love with this game. Colony sims are one of my favorite genresand having one with no combat focused on hydro engineering and irrigation starring adorable sapient beavers is just wonderful.and still allow you to place building blueprints on stuff marked for demolition. - having to manually delete paths is particularly annoyinge.g. so you can find all your gatherers huts to pause themso feel free to skip the restbut this game just has me excited at the future possibilitiesmaybe for other factionscattailswaterlillies or somethingwhere the entrance can be placed underwater but the top is above water (and resists flooding unless totally submergedand to have a horsepower-enhanced advanced research building that worked faster.this would help a lot with making wind and water power more steady in the late game. Most colony sims have you researching batteriesand mechanical energy storage solutions seem fitting for both the genre and the setting.[h1]A City Builder with a Story[/h1]Ancient Citiesand Nebuchadnezzar. But it gets right what a lot of other games miss. There is an ease of play to the mechanics that make it seem like a more developed game. The devs thought of a lot of what the gamer would need. It is already perfectly playable in its current state. The story background is an apocalyptic future where the beavers out-survive the humans. There are ruins scattered around the mappresumably from the fallen human civilizations.as well as a need for basic resources to build withlike wood and metal scraps. I already get a deepermore visual feel for the way the water cycle works than anything you can get from just reading books. Good models are like that.which I do love. I love the ability to shape the land and use dynamite. I love being able to edit and create my own maps. I am also enjoying the trading elements of being able to trade between districts. The whole district component is a fun part of the game.most importantlyI would love the addition of a workshop to play maps that other gamers create and share. I think that multiplayer competitive and cooperative could be perfectly do-able in this game in the future. I also could see the addition of scenarios... which I don't care for very much myself in a game. Butsome people like that. I certainly look forward to more maps and BIGGER maps. It's all good!its well worth the money spentsince I already have over 80 hours in the first week and a half since release. I can't quit playing. I highly recommend this game for people who love city builders.I rarely leave reviewsbut I'm making the effort here because Timberborn is hands down best Early Access game since Factorio (IMOYMMV.but actually managing a seasonal and limited water budget.  There are no shortcuts around it.  While this might sound a bit tediousit makes for an absorbingly refreshing twist on colony management sims.  The fact that it's only in EA means that the game can only get better.I had exactly zero glitches playing this game.  Researchexpansionand planning are all integral parts of the game.  Like any good colony simthere are a ton of ways for things to go off the rails.  In this game more than mostlong range planning will pay off.while I think the the game has a well developed early and early-mid gamethere's not much in the way of a ""late-game"" feel.  I like colony sims/resource management sims where there is a clear transition along the lines of ""survival >> establishment >> incremental expansion >> administrative/logistic mastery >> technological mastery >> environmental mastery >> monument achievement"".  FactorioRimworldKSPand a few others have this progressive feel.  Timberborn sorta halts at incremental expansionand the clearest ""win"" condition that I can see is for the player to completely overcome drought as a limiting factor for survival/expansion.  The fact that this game is still in EA means that there is a chance that his might be addressed as the devs continue to work on the game.  I want to underlinethoughthat this critique is not a black mark for the game at all; it is the opposite.  Despite ""higher"" levels of gameplay not really existing (at least in terms of my model abovethe game remains engaging and fulfilling.  Within the bounds of the gamethe only real limit is your imagination and ingenuity.(and possibly only important to me because I am a water resources professional there are some concepts of water resources management that could be implemented but the devs either haven't gotten there or have decided not to go there.  Some of these concepts are mechanical: automated weir crestsdam bottom outletswater pumpsetc.  In the case of water pumpsthere is a strong chance that the devs might be afraid that a water pump would make the game vulnerable to infinite energy exploitation (though I can see ways around that as well that would not involve rejiggering game physics.   In those other casesI hope to see the devs release them as new features in the future.  Other concepts would take more effort to introduce to the game: pollutiongroundwaterevaporation managementseasonalityocean-water/salinityetc.Timberborn wholeheartedly deserves the ""overwhelmingly positive"" reviews it has received in the first two weeks since its EA release.  It presents all the colony sim challenges that builder-gamers like me craveand does it with a twist that is unique in my experience.  I very much look forward to continuing to play this gameand I can't wait to see where the devs go with this most excellent game.I fucking love this game! It's simple once you get it31 hours total 22 hours latest gameI fiddled around with the mechanics learned how things worked 5 tries later bingo. I have a rather well balanced buildjust hitting metal.I have been gaming 42 years since I was 8and am a DevOps Engineer so you know I like tidy processesI really like what you have here for an early access game. UX/UE is pleasing refinement of the bar I am sure will comeother than that I have a stable 3 district sharing resources setupabout to grind out metal. But I just wanted to give you guys some love from the game so far.whatever... they are the type that whine about the 3rd pixel in the title of the loading screen is offset incorrectly when you are at max 50k resolutionI have a few friends playing and even the girlfriend. (She loves this shit It's a Good wholesome game with the foulest of jokes about wet beavers. I appreciate your art and decent fun I look forward to seeing how this all plays out.Satisfactory 456 hrs (minus pioneer time from EpicDyson Sphere Project 3868 hrsNo game has scratched my itch for a new Banished quite like Timberborn.with different mechanics (such as the drought and HP to make it fresh.I was here when the Beaver-like citybuilder genre was born.Wow ^^. Fastest tutorial ever. The game pretty leaves you to explore everything by yourself.water tanksalways build more water tanksI got the hang of it. First the few points that I think need to be improved:but it would make way more sense if the door was on the opposite side.but it feels very weird and unintuitive. Also doesn't it defeat the purpose of having to build your shaft pipelines? Plus some of these buildings don't even have a shaft connection point at allso you can only power them up via another adjacent building.and how I can reproduce it. Is it controlled by the amount of population? Something else? It's not clear for me when I need to make new districts to expand and when I don't.but I need to build a whole set of transport/deposit buildings _in both directions_ and set various routes to ensure the little number of castors will surviveand then I need to micromanage the workers in this district because some will die of old age and the district will be too small to have a natality that makes up for it. So I very regularly need to manually migrate castors to replace the dead. It would be better if the workers of the district centers or the transport buildings could just transport resources when they are not doing other stuffand if I could set some auto-migration rulessay unemployed castors from my main district could auto-migrate to fill vacant jobs in other districts. I'm not sure exactly how but I feel this part of the game could and should be simplified.because the game lets me build itbut not detonate itespecially when you have built more stuff upon it.the game is a massive timesinkbridgesplatforms3D building. Just wowseveral stories construction it becomes invaluable to check where you should build new shortcuts for your castors and optimize transportationbut if the water goes away you don't even have to repair themshaping a bit of terrain with dynamite takes some time. Alsopaper alone can make dynamite? Hmmm. Go geo-engineer yourself a big pond to survive the drought.where workers could dig through dirt. Of course it would be way slower than dynamitebut it would allow to shape some early little ponds and canals.and I'm not asking for a full-fledged campain (Ã  la Annobut I'd like my beavers to work to something else than just having their needs fulfilled. For instancein a game like Frostpunk I was always feeling I was going somewherelike ""narratively speaking""that I wasn't just bulding stuff just for the beauty of it.and the devs already implemented water physics. Of course full weather management (snow and everything would be even better but I know there's something as asking too much ^^I feel like a kid on a water playground again.FarmPumpSurvive.

1,"I'm going to try to describe the game and also translate the hate you'll read about the gameto give you an idea of what to expect from my point of viewit's true In many casesit's only true for those who have played literally all the content already and have no concept of reality for a new playerand how updates ""suck"" compared to the pastthe game is updated less often than it used to be updated It still gets new content every month at a minimum Many players will say ""Well THIS new content isn't REAL content"" because it doesn't match the content those players wish existedthe game's pretty packed with it There are a decent number of quests While most MMOs have thousands of quests that consist of ""Kill 10 wolves"" Runescape does not Runescape uses its quests for stories Some of those stories are exceptionally well madesome of which are used for combatyou may not enjoy itJagexhas definitely had several problems There is a lot of outdated content in the game that could use a fresh coat of paint at the very least Very little of this will affect your gameplay as a new playerone mechanic that Runescape is lacking: multiple characters Runescape has a one character = one account setup You cannot create multiple characters per single membership The only exception to this is that you can have one character in the modern ""Runescape 3"" gameand one character in ""Old School Runescape""which is an alternative version of Runescape based on how the game played around 2007 (it IS still updated and maintainedit's not just an unsupported relic)but if you like to roll multiple charactersyou'll have to pay the membership fee for each characterthe subredditthe steam forumsthe Runescape site's forumsthat one random guy you know that knows everythingand that other random guy you know that knows nothing:they're not pay-to-win For the most partmost of the outrage you'll see about them is simply that they exista massive amount of the outrage is generated by people who have played Runescape for over a decadedesperately miss the game they once hadand believe that literally anything and everything different is going to kill Runescapethe chances of the micro-transactions negatively affecting you are slim If you've played literally any other MMOor just about any game released in the last decadeyou probably won't notice anything out of the ordinary If that's a bad thing to youfair enoughrun away or don't I started playing in 2005and ""quit"" in 2012 I came back in 2014and ""quit"" in 2015just to come back in 2016 and ""quit"" in 2017 And now I'm back You don't escapeyou just take breaksdo not go to the Runescape subreddit There are some good postsand you might see some good information about the game For the most part thoughthe only people left that browse the subreddit regularly are the most die-hard ""fans"" that hate-play Runescapelatch onto anything and everything bad the company doesand spam about how micro-transactions are ruining the game Ohalso several people that won't hesitate to tell you constantly how ""This is why I quit playing years ago""  It's also the type of subreddit that makes up roughly 001% of the playerbasebut unironically believes it accurately represents the will of the average playersand form your own opinion Even I'm biased It's impossible to play the game for literal years without being biasedthat's awesome! If you don'tit's understandableWhile writing this review I stand at 7926 hours spent on RuneScape (900 hours on the Steam version) and just got the Master Quest Cape after over 15 yearsI was 10 and I didn't even speak englishI learned it entirely thanks to this gameRuneScape really outshines eveyone in that aspectI think nostalgia helped a lot in keeping me goingI even met the devs and the original creators I played this game with all my friends be it at homeon the middle school library's computerduring college classes or even at work and I don't regret a single minute of it It has been a pleasure I'll probably log in now and then to look at what new content will eventually come out but I am finally doneeven if you often tend to mess things upI still owe you a big part of my childhood Thank you for the good timesPicture this ~you've just finished school!

in this review aswell Both games have a very stable and high player base This version of the game is Runescape 3 I personally play both games because they are very different from each other and offer different content such as bosses and raids Both games are really enjoyable This review is made about Runescape 3you can only exchange them for membership They can be bought for real money or for in game money from other playersbut if you want to unlock all content you need to get yourself membership Membership can be bought for around 8/9$ a month You can also obtain membership by buying a bond with in game money More about bonds in the section below If you purchase membership on your account you are member on Runescape 3 and on OSRSbank slotspets etc I do not consider this shop pay to win The only real functional things are bank slots and legendary pets Legendary pets can have 3 abilities For example picking items up when defeating monsters These pets are not OPthe abilities have cooldowns Which means if you kill monsters not every item will end up in your inventoryrangeprayer and summoningwith this combat style you are close to the enemy and fighting with your swordhammer or maul for example Second combat style is magic With this combat style you can be further away from the enemy and you will be casting spells with your wand or staff The third combat style is ranged With this combat style you can also be further away from your enemy You will be shooting arrows with your bow or throwing knifes or axes The monsters in Runescape have different weaknesses All combat styles are based around abilities that you can use The higher the lvl the more abilities you can usefor example go bossingraidsquest together and so much moreEveryone know you never quit Runescape You just take long breaksplayed this game since i was 11 never stopped dont plan on it no one ever quits runescape they just take breaksIf you like to never go outside and if you only want to play the same game for 12h a day then this is for youit's been a whole year since he's touched a woman God bless his soulwould let it steal my friend againWhen I was but a wee ladI had not a care in the worldeating my vegetablesand building up the courage to fight Elvarg and earn my Rune Platebody privilegesI like to go backSo I've been around this game sence 2001I have always loved this game This game has a personal story to me In the year 2002I was still very low leveledkilling goblins and trying to quest I was young and dumb Finally came the time I needed to buy a rune axe (Hatchet as they call it now) I sold almost all the fish & wood and gear I had Wasn't much but it was big to meI begged for gold for 3 days and when I was about to give up One player came up to measked me what I needed the gold for And I said ""I want to cut trees better"" He said ""Hm"" Gave me a Rune Pickaxe & Rune Axe and simply said ""Maybe one day you'll do the same for someone elsegoodluck kid"" I looked down at my keyboard and cried cause I hadn't been treated that way before And its 2021 now and I still have that same pickaxe and hatchet he gave me And with his little helpshowed me being generous is more rewarding to me than just building power for myself alone So I created a Motto ""Everyone deserves a hand in lifebad or goodrich or poor"" :) Runescape is definitely a wonderful placeGame is grind Grind waste time Waste time goodSometimes I just sit at my deskstaring at my character at a bankrealizing it's been over 15 years since I first play this gameRuneScapeHello darkness my old friendIf you get membership status on one of the RuneScapesit counts for both of them[h1][u]TLDR:[/u][/h1]then I can recommend RS3 Ironman as a solid experience worth trying In typical RuneScape fashionthe game is free-to-play but 90% of the content is locked to purchasing membershipso I would recommend that you do so to fully experience the gamethe ""RS3 = bad"" petty meme made by die-hard Old School RuneScape fans is just that: a meme When the game first became a thing in 2012 with the Evolution of Combat (EOC) updateit was very janky and poorly introduced In present daythe game's combat and gameplay is largely more refined and less convoluted to usethough admittedly still a bit new player-unfriendlyyou are thrust into the world of Gielinor to explore at your leisure You can participate in various activities such as leveling up your skillsslaying monsters for loot and experienceand completing quests/tasks to obtain unique account upgrades In contrast to Old School RuneScapeRS3's combat system is based on abilities and adrenaline There is a lot more that needs to be learned about the combat system than can be said in hereso I would recommend that you check out a few outside resources/videos to better understand itIronman mode avoids pay-to-win progressionyou are forced to do everything yourself; if you want gear/item upgrades then you will have to do activities yourself until the items drop instead of immediately buying them from another player The mode ""forces"" you out of the comfort zone and opens you up to exploring the game and figuring out new methods to reach goals and to possibly experience content that you had never heard of or wanted to try out With Ironman modenearly everything you do has a purpose rather than having a goal of making enough money to buy somethingalbeit some activities might be considered dead-content but the newer content is actually more engaging and often more rewarding to do Just to name a few that have released recently: Big Game Hunter is basically training the Hunter skill by skillfully navigating around an arena to take down enormous dinosaur creaturesand the new Anachronia agility course is different from the old & outdated standard courses in that it is broken up into sectionstakes upwards of 6+ minutes to fully completeand awards very high experience rates when skillfully navigated There is a lot of content to get lost in within the game and I appreciate thatbut there are still some older areas in the game that have not been graphically updated to meet the newer area aesthetics In terms of equipmentgear typically looks better as you progress up from the early tiers to the later tiersI don't care one bit about the story and I space-bar through all quest/game dialogue because I really don't like the idea of walking up and talking to the gods in a regular conversation Admittedlyif you are a lore nut and enjoy learning about the history of the gamethen there is a lot for you to dive intoyou can experience many substories in the form of quests and Elite Dungeons in the later part of the gamepartially due to the fact that the developers don't need to poll the players on their opinions about every single piece of planned contenteven without pay-to-win or bonus-exp-weekends Generallyyou reach your skill goals faster and move on towards more exciting content at a quick pace instead of tryharding your way to achieve maximum efficiency by 2-ticking something on OSRSbut when you do figure them out it is pretty good even though it still relies on tick-based actions Particularly for movementit is a blast to zoom around the map quickly with Double Surge and the mobile perkbut the devs haven't really punished themyou are constantly bombarded with MTX promotions and ""sales""the game can quickly becomes a list of ""daily chores""but there is no third-party client to play RS3 on to enhance your quality of lifebut there are barely any substantial updates to support ant PvPbut some older content does appear to get more outdated and irrelevant as time goes on Nonethelessthere is a lot to do in the game and you can sink thousands of hours into it and still have a fun timeI only wrote this review for awards"" is a waste of everyone's time If you are interested in genuine & detailed game reviewsfeel free to check out my others

it""[/b][/h1]steam doesn't format this review properly so click on the blue thumbs up next to my name to read it with better formattingthere are [b][u]TWO VERSIONS OF RUNESCAPE PRESENT:[/u][/b]where Jagex basically found an old copy of Runescape 2 back from 2007and they chose to continue making updates onwards from that clone before the controversial updates that are currently present in Runescape 3or maybe even RS1 (RS classic)your character will be transferred herelike mine wasit felt extremely overwhelming to get started with at first From having 28 skills to level fromall the way to having 227 quests (at the time of writing this review)each varying in how long they could be and having very interesting lore PersonallyI enjoy the quests in RS3 compared to some other MMO's because there is more to them then simply""Kill 5 cows"" or""Pick up 5 flowers"" There is enough content and variety here to keep you entertained for hours on end There's a reason to do these quests toosince they may unlock new powerful abilitiesor gain new items to equipand the reason for killing them could be for moneycollecting a specific item if you are an ironmanor going after pets (which are basically companion collectibles)although everybody might not care about it The vast amount of lore you can find within this game is fantasticsome being much better then others Not interested in the lore? No problemjust hold spacebar through every quest and skip every cutscene and you'll be fine Whether or not you know the lore to the game is insignificant as to how you will play and level your statsno matter how long or how short it isit feels satisfying just to eventually hit it Going after a goal like unlocking the invention skill which requires level 80 in 3 skills is something that may take a whilebut it isn't just for nothing It unlocks powerful perks that will assist greatly in bossing or skilling Even getting level 99 in a stat on it's own is satisfying and you are able to buy an accomplishment cape that has a special perk (such as reviving you once every hour should you die)"" which are similar to WoW tokens where you can redeem them in order to get 14 days of membership per bond These can be bought off the Grand Exchange for roughly 30 million gold pieces (GP) at the time of this review Not only thatbut members translates from OSRS/RS3 as wellas long as you have members on the same account when switching between both gamesknown as""The Evolution of Combat (EoC)"" To summarizeEoC was basically a combat update where the game's combat changed from clicking once and your character would fightto eventually having ability barsrevamped the entire combat triangleetc One might think""Why would it be bad? Doesn't that make the combat more innovating?"" Well sort of You seethe problem with EoC was that upon releaseit was horribly unbalanced Some ability's totally overshadowed othersand it had ALOT of bugs It also made many weapons that were once very useful irrelevantlike dragon daggers and dragon claws Not to say it was a complete failure though Later on it became better as more bugs related to it was fixedbut it was too late by then because most of the playerbase had stopped playing the game PersonallyI feel indifferent towards this but it is difficult as to whether or not I should truly label this as a positive/negative about RS3 so I will leave it herejust to be able to do some sort of efficient bossinglet alone skill decently takes a significant amount of time to get going I'm almost 300 hours in at the time of this review and I still am working towards things like combo overloads I would not have some of the progress I had today if I did not swap gold from OSRS to RS3which shows how significant the grind is Some may like itsome won't It's all personal opinionbut in the end I can say for sure that RS3's grinds in general are definitely quicker than OSRS'there are a f**kton of MTX's in this game compared to it There's literally a minigame in RS3 known as""Treasure Hunter"" where you can open chests and have a chance of getting exp or 200 million cash This is why it is much easier and faster to max in RS3 compared to OSRS Combined with DXP eventsbeing able to literally buy EXP for basically every skill in the game is something that puts off many playersmyself included Some people may say""oh just ignore it"" or""it doesn't affect you"" or even""just login every day! You get 2 free! or do quests! You get 2 every quest completionso it balances out!"" Yeah no It doesn't matter if they give it to me for free or even if I ignored itI still get reminded every day that I have treasure hunter keys available to be useda tick is the way both Runescape 3 and OSRS process your own character's actions It is f**king horrific Being at 06 seconds every tick Think of it as playing at 600 pingplus the latency from whatever country you are connecting from to that server All server sided actions are determined by this tick systemwhich is extremely annoying when doing things like bossing You want to move to a specific location? No problemjust click on a tile and wait 06s for your clicks to register! As frustrating as this isJagex has acknowledged this and are planning to turn the tick rate to 01s instead of 06s which Well that was like last year or the year before that so that's probably gonna be a whileI shouldn't have to spend an hour or two in game just to readjust the UI so it is to my liking Of coursesome may say to switch to legacy mode or the legacy UI which changes your entire HUD so it is similar to that of RS2but you will not be as strong as if you were to use EoC insteadacross both OSRS and RS3 Even with 2FAyou can still have your account taken from you just from basic social engineering Recentlya popular streamer known as Woox (some may say the best OSRS player) had one of his OSRS accounts taken from someone just because somebody asked Jagex for his account information Absolutely horrible and this needs to be addressedI prefer OSRS over RS3 because of nostalgia and I enjoy the PvM content there more Despite being more simpleit still manages to find innovating ways to encounter the bosses with the simpler combat system Even though I believe OSRS > RS3that doesn't mean RS3 is necessarily a bad game Both are good in my eyesand which one you like better is up for you to decideHello! Fifteen year veteran herewith over 17000 total logged hours on a few accountsI can personally say I recommend this game to anyone who fancies themselves an MMORPG playerRS3 has undergone a few model changeswith the addition of microtransactions I find that they are a necessary part of keeping the game aliveso long as they are implemented in the proper way (NOT Pay to win) Microtransactions in particular have been a cause of hugely heated debate amongst the Runescape community PersonallyI find them easy to avoid Your opinions willof coursebe your ownhours and hours may be spent grinding a skill you wish to maxor getting your best kill time on a popular boss With 28+ skill to try and maxand hundreds of monsters to kill for lootand millions and billions of Gold Pieces to be madeRS3 has many many hours still yet to offer even a player like me However you wish to spend your timeRS3 is a great place to spend itI started playing at 14 years of age I met my best friend on here in 2006 and we are sitting in Discord together as I type this out My best friend introduced me to my wifewith whom I have two wonderful children with *This is not a dating site*feel free to add me for any questions you may have! My name is Flynnsterand I hope to see you in game!I'm averaging roughly 8 hours of active playtime a day on top of a normal 8 hour job Kinda disgusting to be honestis more or less a single player experiencealthough there are some mini-games that you can play that involve a lot of player interaction The game truly kicks off late gamealthough getting to that point is a journey in itself But it is most definitely not a boring journey Being able to set your own goals and accomplish them at your own pace is what sets Runescape apart from other MMOs It is hard to touch on the core mechanics of the game since every mechanic is considered a core mechanic Just gonna use that as a segway to get people to play RunescapeI have about 10000 hours in RuneScape and if you like:before you know ityouâ€™ll have been playing for almost 15 years and have about 10000 hours in the gameplaying RuneScape is like clapping Once you start you never really stop The intervals between playing (claps) might increase but you never truly stopJagexthanks for an alright first 10000 hours and hereâ€™s to the next 10000 CheersA place where I spent almost 10k hours andremaxedre-remaxedMy brother has played for probably about 11 yearspaid for membershipincluding his wifes and put so much time in the game He wanted to get my boyfriend and myself into the game and offered us a big sum of in game money to get us started He had the moneyobviously from playing the game for years This resulted in him being banned PERMANENTLY He tried to appealbut they claimed their ""mod"" found evidence of cheating which is just insane He was not able to talk to an actual person and when trying to contact them on facebook a bot sent him a picture of a cake (while funny) situations like this need to be taken more seriously He loved this game and was a dedicated player for years and it was all taken away for NOTHING"
1,"I am 75 and retired and yesa gamer :0) I had been playing a lot of Valheim and what I loved most about that game was the building component My son bought me Space Engineers for my birthdayand now I have two incredible building and resource mining games Space Engineers is working this old brain helping me avoid mind deterioration I love this game and I appreciate the community that shares some incredible accomplishmentsI just had an epiphany Yes I didtheir money and wishes are just as important right?)easy mode doesn't teach you anything It's a ""Lego meet Asteroids"" style and some even called it for a ""Minecraft"" clone as a result Add building block Add another blockand another ad infinitum until you have spaceship For meit got boring quickly It's called ""creative mode""- just buildit took me over an hour to work out how to build a single block from the remains of a craft crashed into an asteroidI have a ship I can salvageall the while careful of my energy limitmy inventory I need a refinery The refinery is needed if salvage doesn't give me everything I need so I'll need raw material to convert to ingotsincluding uranium ore which I convert to processed uranium to fuel the reactor so I can do ALL these thingssteel etc Some of these can be salvaged Some have to be made Every component needs to locatedtransportedlinked and welded EVERY component You need a plan A rough sketch on what you intend to build helps alot It gives you purpose because time is of the essence if you're not watching and run out of fuel you're dead No energy means no refining of uranium ore to refuelexpending more of that precious reactor fuel Who knows The decisions you make determine what you build and how fast it's going to takesky markers""horizon"" indicatorscompasses or suchlose your bearings and home disappearslose it all or go ""friends only"" and do the hard yards with mates to build the biggest dang skyship ever made There's missilesgunsturretsfire and light Death There's explosionsbroken platformsbusted shipsCAD and a master plana lot of the options are not as intuitive as I'd like The UI is a bit invasive and some work could be done here The universe is grey I'm sure some awesome nebulae would fit in great here and add appeal to the wonder of spaceit's alpha as I writebut I've experienced no crashes It's going to be good thing this Space Engineers and the devs seem happy to includewhatever people damn well pleaseI'll minerefinetransport and assemble another It'll be bigger It'll do more The welding torch will blind my eyes as I drift in and out of the superstructure boundariesmy suit energy draining awaySoafter nearly 5 years and 35k hours on this gameI finally decided to take some time to give this game the review it deserved Implicitlythe evidence is there for some types of people (looking at youLego fanatics and Minecraft nuts!)but if you have an attention span that has allowed you to get this farBUY THIS GAME!every time Fair warningthe learning curve can be quite daunting (as many hours as I have loggedI'm STILL learning stuff!) and the build timedepending on settingsmay take hours to months to build Howeverwhen you hear that ""woosh"" sound from your Gyros kicking inand the hum of those engines when your ship leaves the station for the first timeits all worth it Everytime There will be your fair share of ""WTF?! moments"" but they are character building experiences at this point relatively for me because this game runs amazingly well now compared to earlier versions of the product Alsothe SE groups I have come to know makes me think that SE is one of the least toxic environments I have ever played in for any length of time 11/10 recommendand watch for KlangKeenMarekand our amazing modding community: Thank you for all of your hard work This is the game I have waited my entire life to play! YOU ROCK!!!OkI'd best describe SE as Minecraft in space with a touch of Garry's mod for physics fun  I enjoy that sort of gameso it went on my watch list until the price point matched what I was willing to pay  I bought SE a few years ago when it was much ""younger"" and had some issues that made playing frustrating  There are still a few issues that need to be worked out (more on that later)but I think the dev team has done a great job of keeping it moving forwardjust you and vast space and exploration  Some have said that this lack of story and the lack of any real ""end game"" type content takes away from the game and I can see where they are coming from  If you're the type of person who gets bored just building things and you want to get to a point where things just work so you can go after bad guysthen this is probably not your type of game  If you are the type of person who finds yourself annoyed at the story and such getting in the way of tinkering and seeing what you can do with what you havethen this is probably right up your alley  I cannot stress enough that this game is very much multiplayer friendly  If you canplay with others  It's way more fun to work together on things  It makes the accomplishments that much more awesome when you can show them off and have a laugh with friends when they fail miserably and possibly explosivelyI'd recommend watching a few ""beginner's guide"" videos for this game  A youtuber called ""Vechs"" has a really good set of videos that should do a good job of setting your expectations for your first play   Here's the first one: [url=https://wwwyoutubecom/watch?v=y825m51cCfA]Space Engineers Meteor Storm Survival Episode 01[/url]  I would recommend starting in space as well  I'll explain why laterbut suffice it to say it's just easier to get the hang of things and in my humble opinion more fun  Once againI would also recommend playing with friends if you can  The basic premise is very much like minecraft: Search for resources then build cool stuff  In the beginningyou'll be building [strike]ugly[/strike] simple ships that will look much like the lego creations we all probably created as kids with the ""giant box of every lego piece in the house"" mishmash of mismatched parts  Forgot a forward thruster? Just stick one on somewhere  Need to go faster?  Slap some more thrusters on that baby  And of that leads to the next section:your iterative design process that yielded the ""Mine-o-saurus"" with 8 mining heads and just the right size to get inside asteroid caves was a long one  When you crash itit sucks  But this is what I love about it  More so than any other game I've playedI find myself playing rather conservatively sometimes with my ""favorite"" toys and I take care of them because I'm proud of how well they work and having to rebuild is kinda sad  I like this ""attachment"" and I think it alters the gameplay in a way that almost fills the void where a story might go  Now that being said there are ways to create blueprints and rebuild the ships you made more quicklybut I won't go into that here because it isn't always the best option and it is sometimes more trouble than it's worthbut if I had started playing on a planetthis would probably be a very different review  Gravity sucks and they haven't gotten the physics balance where it ought to be for good gameplay in my opinion  Friction is a thing thatin space is not really a key factor  On a planetit's everything because any rolling vehicle needs it and it just doesn't work well  Collisions cause damageduhright?  But what if every little bump and bounce your little dune buggy hits causes damage?  It does  We gave up on rolling vehicles after having more than one explode for seemingly no reason  As of this writingwheeled vehicles are just useless except on perfectly flat terrain and that's not really much fun  Gravity makes building flying devicesarguably the greatest portion of gameplay in SEmore difficult and keeping them in one piece almost impossible  Landing without crashingeven with a good designis very difficult It's weird space is far more forgiving in this aspect  You can leave a ship parked in one place with just some thrusters and a gyro and it will stay therebut in gravityyou are constantly using fuel to keep your ship in the air and even more to keep it upright and level  These two facts make mining on planet an arduous task compared to in space  We killed more good equipment trying to make something that could mine ore without blowing up than I care to count  All that being saidonce you've got the hang of the gamegive it a try it's a huge challengebut it isn't without rewards when you do get things working well enough to start to explore the planet a little more  We even had fun starting on planet and basically working to get ourselves to space before we could start exploring the stars on one play throughI was looking for a game that would give me some of the feels I got from playing Factorio I picked Space Engineers upand spent a hundred hours on it in a couple of weeks It's a deeply engaging experienceand to start with the planetary lander You start in a shipflying in the atmosphere of a planetwhich you can't leave (because the ship only has atmospheric thrusterswhich only work when an atmosphere exists)but you can fly around until you find the perfect landing spot Once you get therestart scraping your ship to collect material to establish your first base From therethe world's your oister Expand the basemake mining vehiclesexplore the planetset up outposts And when you feel readymake a rocketand take off for the stars If you're luckyyour rocket will be powerful enough for you to leave the planet's gravity welland you'll be ready to make your first space station! Then of courseyou will need a new space mining shipa shuttle to get back and forth from planets and moonsa mothership to store your stuff and your shipssomething to defend against pirates And I haven't talked about the multiplayer yetI couldn't recommend it more As you can see from my time playedit is incredibly addictive The gameplay is amazingthe ship building is an absolutely blastand then using your ships is even more of a blast! (In more ways than one!) The community is one of the best on steamand I think this game deserves that title too :)I built a big space ship with everything you would need Then when I was ready to use it for destruction I realized I have no friendsalmost a thousand hours in and i still dont really know what im doingIt took us hours to buildand hours more to paintbut when it was doneour station was top notch: three designated landing padsa central control hub to maintain the station's sytsemsa player hub filled with medical bays and storage spaceand two full refinery-assembler combos My partner in crime placed the blocks I welded them in place and splashed some paint on it all once the basic shape of it was finished It was not largebut it was cleanfunctionaland designed with sophistication  It was oursand we had built it out from the tiny little square of space we had started withturned it into our own little command post lodged in the side of an otherwise unnoteworthy asteroidthough Without the shipsthere were no resources to build with First was the mining ship We equipped it with four sets of drills and my partner took it out on missions to gather more resources He was goneand so I built our second ship: a fast little cruiser made only to get from one place to the next or to scout out potential mining sites We called it the Toad And so we settled into a routine: I would take the Toad out and find a nice planet ready for excavation and he would go plow into it with the mining ship We unloaded the materials We assembled them into parts We put those parts into the blocks he had put down We toiled We slaved We built and built and built""Look what we have built from nothing Admire our structure"" Did we bask in the glory of a hard fifteen hours of work?the beginning of our empire: the Mothershipthree storage containerstwelve gigantic thrustersenough room in the hangars to store both of our ships (and possibly more)several medical bays to respawn inâ€”and one ridiculously enormous ship We placed the first block above our station And then another and anotheruntil the massive frame of it started to block out the light It was a monolith to our own accomplishmentsa totem of sheer ingenious design and willpower Not a block was out of placenot a single reactor was missingbut the blocks couldn't be finished without more steel plates We need ironâ€”a lot of iron So away my partner went! He climbed into the mining shipsteered it towards our latest excavation site and gunned the engines He hit max speed He piloted the ship around the end of the ghost-like frame of the Mothership And then it happenedâ€”the unthinkable: he ran out of fuelwith no way to stop the mining ship from moving forwardhad to bail out of the ship before it carried him away to oblivion There was a panicked rush to mount a rescue of our mining ship by using the Toad to chase after it so we could supply the mining ship with the fuel its reactor needed to activate the reverse thrusters and stop the shipwith the slowheart-pounding realization of a horror filma shadow passed over the Toad  We looked up at the Mothershipour entire view eclipsed by its awesome mass We dropped our tools and stared in gut-twisting horror1000 hoursI enjoyed them tooSpace Engineers wasand sadly still is nothing more than Marek Rosa's ""Kick Starter"" for a completely different company called ""Good AI"" KSH lost most of its senior staff and programmers for this new companyand SE has gone completely downhill sincePlanets being the last ""Gift"" the original team left usnewmore nefarious bugs created by the inexperienced staff leftover from the original KSH (or maybe just cheap hired help) and planets that have been expanded on exactly zero timesthose exist too50% or more There is fun to be hadjust don't expect any ground breaking progress The only thing keeping this game alive is moddersprops to themI usually dislike early access games I usually take a fat pinch of salt when I see new 'build your own' style game comes come onto Steam too Not in this case Space Engineers has quickly earned a spot in my all time favorite PC games for its dynamic and engaging construction system and it's got one of the coolest looking destruction systems I've ever seen in a game like this The devs have been keeping up with weekly updates since its launch and they're very involved with the community As a matter of factplayer made content will be appearing as randomly spawned ships in the upcoming exploration patcheven familiar for most people I'm sure It's like Minecraftin that you're building pretty much everything out of blocksbut that's where the similarities end Ships are made by sticking a power plantcockpita couple gyroscopes and thrusters (In every direction by the way! Space has no gravity or atmosphere so your ship needs forward thrusters to slow downetc)maybe a few weapon systems Then you have to hook up conveyor pipes to most of those things to power them with resources and components you get from mining asteroids Ships can be as big or as small as you likethe only real limit is how much your PC can handle Everything from little scout fightersmining shipsfrigatesfighter carriers and even humongous titan-sized battleships can be built Yesyou could even build your own Death Starbut you might have to wait a little while for a working Superlaser Or you could just mod your own Superlaser into the gamebecause Space Engineers has a modding API and a fully fledged Steam Workshop page that's already crammed with all sorts of player created contentor if the first ship you had gets destroyed and you want a replacementyou can just ctrl-v it into the game after selecting it from the blueprints menu Very very handytear and otherwise deform when they take damagewhether you're hosing them down with leadsetting off explosions or just smashing into eachother for fun You can see the damage your ship takes over time as holesscratchesdents and warping are modelled into most blocks Even portions of your ship can be sheared off and cause extra damage as they free float in spacegetting knocked around and causing even more havoc as they get caught on your ship and tear it apart from the inside if you're not careful The same rules apply to your enemy too though It's very exciting and sometimes anxiety-inducingthe way combat workssurvival and creative Survival mode lets you build everything from scratch and assemble it together using the various ingame tools you're provided with Everything needs to be constructed piece by piece and you're limited by how many resources you have and what kind of tools you have available You can mount bigger and better drillswelders and grinders onto your ships after you acquire enough suppliesas does the overall performance of the gamebut so far it's come together very very nicely and I expect I'll put another fifty hours or so into the game before it's releasedBattlestar GalacticaWarhammer 40k or any other scifi genrebuy this game You'll thank me laterIf this game were only creative modeit would still be one of the greatest games ever made  I used to describe the game as 'Minecraft in Space'but I think that analogy falls very short of the truth  I've seen people build things in this game that just boggle the mind  One person used a simple set of rotors to make a tank tread that was far more amazing than if the programmers had just put a stock tank tread component into the game  Another person used a series of timers to build an autonomous mining drone that could be set loose to gather materials while the player performed other tasks  The key word in the title of this game isn't 'Space'it's 'Engineers'Me and my brother used to build space ships out of the pieces in Halo Reach forge world Fun times Always wished we could build those and fly them I used to build space ships in the early days of minecraft Same thoughtif only I could build ships and fly them around Then I this game comes out all those years laterand too see the amount of work that has been done on it since is amazingthere are tons of those who complain about certain things with some updatesand sometimes people dont like the direction the comapny might be takingbut all in allI still have a great time playing thisand with the planets it ads a whole new level of fun to what once was an asteroid hopping gameweaponsskinsyou name itsomeone has made it Mods are what really make this game for meFrom the very first videos that promoted this game prior to its launch on Steamthe game looked impressivemelding a voxel game (similar in nature to another popular game) to a deformable physics platform set in SpaceSpace Engineers has been in Early Accessbut each week the developers have been adding to and improving the gameadding features requested by the communityas well as adding their own particular enhancementsmaking Space Engineers an impressive multiplayer sandbox experienceand hope to continue playing for a long time to comeSpace engineers What can I say? Its the best space sandbox out there During my time playing iti've started a factionheld destruction derbiescrashed massive ships into one anotherand build beautiful stations inside asteroids I've spent over an hour searching for cobalt to make a single ore detectorconstructed a walking robot only to see it destroyed by a stray asteroidand built a ridiculously fast ship to stab other ridiculously fast ships with I made something orbit before Spherical Gravity Generators were added I can't describe the amount of fun I've had with this game The devs are awesometheres an incredible new update every weekand the community is amazing Sodo I recommend it? Hell yesits actually rather funnyMy friend collected materials for our very first ship for hours and i crashed it on takeoffHe sounded like he was having a stroke or something and then there was silence on teamspeak 10/10A friend told me to get this Few minutes after i started playing for the first time i used jetpack to try and reach them but it ran out of hydrogen and i went face first into ground and died Friend wanted me to get on his buggy so i went to crouch forward towards it but pressed jetpack button and went face first into it and died We got into space and i spent 3 days building my perfect ship but then i got caught in planets gravity and crashed face first into planets surface Absolutely love this game xDAs you can see by the hours I've logged in Space EngineersI like this gameI thought I'd put a brief review of it upit doesn't have a lot of stuff happening for the player to respond to There are a couple token NPC typesand some largely directionless NPC shipsbut the game world overall feels rather lifeless Thankfully there are a number of mods that address thisbut the unmodded single-player world doesn't force the player to respond to it very muchapart from various resource and survival-related concerns Expect single-player to be more of a contemplative experience that you take at your own paceand in which you set your own goals While I would definitely prefer there to be more active challenges that I'm forced to respond tothe gameplay that is there is still a lot of fun No other game I've played has made designing and building my own base as enjoyable as Space Engineersthe degree depending on the server you're on I have played very little multiplayer myselfbut friends I've talked to have described a range of server typesfrom hardcore PvP to private little servers focused around building things together MP is much more stable than it used to bebut you should still be prepared for potentially frustrating bugsparticularly physics-related ones That saidif I had time in real-lifeI'd be active on a multiplayer server without hesitationbecause the fun you can have outweighs the frustrationdamagedor destroyed by colliding with another object No other game I've played provides this aspectand it shapes just about every aspect of gameplay directly or indirectly As the name indicatesthe main challenge of Space Engineers is that of engineering solutions to problemsand the physics system is essential to giving the player problems that need to be solvedbecause you can weaponize the physics system -- something that has led to a very entertaining and active ""arms race"" between various players trying to build better player-made weapons and defenses to them The programmable blockwhich allows players to run scripts they've written in C#allows this to be taken to its logical extremerunning guidance programs written by the players themselvesyou know it has succeeded I'm not sure at [i]what[/i] but it's definitely some kind of success ;)by and large the game's physics make sense I do wish Keen would simplify some aspects of the physics system furtherto make gameplay easier even at the cost of realismbut the physics system these days is much more of an asset than a liability And if I'm entirely honest with myselfI've never seen a game that uses physics that behaves perfectly realistically Fans of Kerbal Space Program will understandand I'd like to properly do the game justice by writing an in-depth one laterbut this will have to do for now If you like voxel-building gamessci-fi stuffand self-directed gameplayyou will probably like Space EngineersSpace Engineers is an excellent game and a gift that keeps on giving That being said it is a game I wager is best enjoyed by certain audiencesand is an ideal game to spend a lot of time playing for anyone who enjoys building If you're like me and gladly sink hours into building a complex spaceship to fly it into spaceplace satellites in orbitmake a mars roving vehicle or recreate the ISS you will love this game That being said I STRONGLY recommend looking into mods (especially the ones I link under cons) as they compliment some of the more primitive or shoddy systems in the game Especially the mod that adds real atmospheric/flight physics is a must havesince it makes building functional aircraft a real experience The speed is normally locked to 100 m/s but this can be changed easily with mods without any real side effects Makes travelling around huge systems or even planets a little bit less tedious"

1,"Went exploring a cave fully equipped Made it out barely alive and lost most of my equipmentInstead of looking for my son I built a few gazebosa rudimentary navy with an armada of small raftsand fully-stocked dock homes strategically placed along the river system and coastlines I watched the sunset while drinking a soda and realized I never wanted a son anyway 10/10I generally hate survival games  You know the ones i meanthe ones that became almost overnight megahits a few years back like ArkRust etc  Anyone who's tried to actually play one knows spawn campers and the shoot on sight mentality makes it rough without a very large grouptruly like this game as even without the PvP I thought it'd be the same tired old grind  Chop down some treesmake a houseblah blah blah  Jesus I was wrong  First thing i noticed is the enemies are actually pretty terrifying  I'd be chopping down a tree or hunting a deer and hear screeching from something that didn't even sound human anymore coming from way too close for comfort only for a mutant cannibal thing to leap out a tree at me and almost give me a heart attacksometimes they'll screech at you without attacking  Even when you expect them to attackthey're stealthy as hell and almost always surprise mebut never easy to come by  Combining that rock solid gameplay loop with terrifying enemies causes The Forest to transcend every other survival game I've ever tried  It's funterrifyingand mysterious in the best way possible  Cannot reccomend this game highly enough- Attacked by naked peopleA game that actually escapes early access and still keeps a low price +1 devsDo you like Survival games where you craft things? How about horror games that can still take you by surprise every now and then even after playing for hours? Well then this game is for you  The game takes mechanics from both of these genres to give you an unsettlingyet fun experience in one game Build a base and defend it from mutant cannibals that roam the islandexplore caves to find items to make your life easierand solve the mysterys of the peninsulathis game has an actual storyline for your to complete The main characterEric LeBlanc's plane crashes on the island and his son Timmy is kidnapped by a mysterious man covered in red paint You'll need to explore caves to find key items to help you in your search for Timmy and get to the bottom of the sinkhole in the center of the islandthis might be a good optionthere are starved skinny variants of each mutant type These mutants are crazed and attack out of desperation They'll also stop to eat dead bodies occasionallyeven in the heat of battle These mutants are faster than their more sane counterparts but have less healthoften in patrols  These patrols are very dangerous without the proper weaponsinstead they just charge at you Their attacks have enough force to strip the player of armorkill other mutantslevel the player's base in secondsand even knock down trees! Trulythey're not something to take lightlymy diet consists solely of snack bars and alcohol and i haven't slept in 22 daysI highly recommend this game to anyone who can tolerate nudity and gore This can be just a survival game as you can turn the cannibals off on the main menubut to me the cannibals are the meat and potatoes of this game and I find myself sorely missing them should they not come visit me a couple of times a daybut will mostly unite in their hatred of the guy deforesting their land(you) The cannibals will still throw a couple of punches at each other if thereâ€™s enough of them around however There are starving cannibals who will try to stalk you to find out where you live and try to scavenge off any kills you makescouts for larger tribes who will often simply run away to alert others of your locationshunting parties (though Iâ€™m pretty sure theyâ€™re only hunting you)and cannibals just trying to live out their lives in peace that you can finding sleeping in camps or caves Cannibals will duck and roll to evade attacksclimb trees to escapelight tennis balls on fire and throw them at youwreck your base if youâ€™re not carefulbut theyâ€™ll also do things like drop effigies which you can catch them praying at if left uninterruptedtheyâ€™ll drag their wounded out of battle if they canand will run off to retrieve others if you let them escapebut will surface more frequently the more you piss the cannibals off These (with the exception of the babies) are significantly tougher to kill and do a lot more damage If they come near your base they mean business and while the spider mutant takes a couple of hits to tear anything downIâ€™ve seen armsy rip a tree OUT OF THE GROUND and slam it into my basedestroying multiple defensive spikes and walls allowing the small army of ten or so he brought with him entrance into the base The sumo dude doesnâ€™t even need to do anything super special to wreak havocif he runs at your base everything in his path will be destroyed until he stops runningthough I donâ€™t think theyâ€™d ever be friendly with you If you escape the plane crash quickly before they find you and are not stalkedyou can have the opportunity to build a base without their knowledge if you pick a private enough location not on one of their common routesand they generally wonâ€™t find it unless you are followed home If in contrast you do everything you can to piss them off (mass cannibal killingsmutant killingseffigy destruction and creationburning their bodies in front of them)they will be significantly more inclined to bother you constantly In my current single player game I see at least 4-6 spider mutants a day somewhat near my base1-2 armsiesand the sumo dudes have only just started coming out so luckily itâ€™s been one at a time Even though I am absolutely plagued by mutantsI can always ghost them and move to a different part of the map Youâ€™re in control of how much you see themwhich really makes the game AI feel more real and dynamicwhich really doesnâ€™t happen in multiplayer Sure when youâ€™re in the caves theyâ€™ll still drop from the ceiling but when itâ€™s two against three your odds are a lot better and you know itdiluting the terroryou can eat peopleThe Forest is all about surviving and getting out alive butnow that I finally did itI can't wait to get back to it in the upcoming sequel!me and my friends led mostly nomadic livesbuilding only what was necessary to spend the night while catering only to the most basic needs and staying constantly on the move throughout the peninsula and its network of underground caves in pursuit of our goalsthat does not have to apply to you and your band of brothersI enjoyed the exploration the most and can't even remember all of the times that The Forest left me gasping in amazement Successfully navigating through and surviving the perils of the cave systems felt like a rewards of it's own to which the frequent â€œlore chunksâ€ and occasional gear upgrades were more of a cherry on topevery cave that we successfully navigated and went through felt like it was 100% our doing as there were no â€œarrowsâ€ guiding our way to take the creditand the moderate consumption and distribution of previously prepared rations encouraged us to embark on another expedition and conquer the peninsula and all of it's nook's and cranny'sone by onethere's also a simple yet sufficient base building aspect to The Forestgetting familiar withharvesting and eventually cultivating local flora (and even some fauna) comes with advantages of their own â€“ as well as the consequencesit's great to have a place called home but should you stay in it for too long and make a ruckus while doing itbe prepared to deal with your new and openly unhappy neighborsbe prepared for more than a couple of sleepless nights Also keep in mind that violence breeds violence soif it's not necessary or in self-defensetry not to cast the first stone Cowering in the nearby bushes or simply running away is probably the best option - unless you crave bloodshedunlike most games dabbling in the survival genreThe Forest actually has the beginning and the ending It even provides the player with optional activity that will encourage exploration and investigation which I highly recommend doing as it will shed some light on the history of the the land and events that took place therewellthat's up for you to decide but I can say that I really liked it and that it definitely wasn't a bad one Those of you who liked [spoiler]â€œLOSTâ€the TV showyou will most likely appreciate this one Bullsh!t ending not included[/spoiler]creative team and help them make a sequel worthy of The Forest I personally can't recommend it enoughI cut down a tree and it broke my houseso i cried for an hourTL:DRuse skins for craftingand mount heads on wall of your houseEAI feel I've gotten more than my moneys worth out of the game I haven't finished the game yetbut I've seen videos of people who have I'm more interested in base building and waging war on cannibals There isn't much of a story Your plane crasheskid is abducted by cannibalsyou need to save him That's all there is to it No quests or anything like that As you explore you find pictures drawn by kidsand photosand empty camps that show others have been here before you You need to put forth a good effort to piece together a story Almost like a detective Find the clues to explain the situation It's there if you want itbut seems to be something the devs threw in there as an afterthought It's well done imo thoughand takes some effort to make a really intricate base The system of base building allows you to build very complex bases though Which is great for when you get a large group of cannibals attacking your base you can make all kinds of fun ways to trap or funnel them into choke points for maximum cannibal crushing carnage After every update all the trees you've cut down will respawn So getting a bunch of trees suddenly appearing right through the middle of your house is a possibility Make sure you build your base around the trees you've cut downjust leave the stumps and build around them Cutting the trees that are growing through structures will destroy the structuremolotovsaxesspearsetc Just open the inventory and start combining ingredients Certain herbs can be combined to restore health/stam Combine 2 deer skin with rope and cloth to make a waterskin Feathers and sticks to make arrows Add cloth and booze to arrows to make fire arrows A watch+coins+booze+circuit board to make a bomb Add sap for a sticky bomb Pretty simple Once you add an item to the crafting mat in the inventory (just right click something to add it to the crafting matno clicking and dragging nonsense)a stick for examplea list appears telling you every item you can make using a stick A bowspearupgraded spearsnowshoesarrowsclubetc It doesn't tell you which ingredientsor how many you will need to make each item though So trial and erroror googleis needed It's kinda fun Almost like a mini gamehand holdingtutorial (besides a very simplistic manual that explains the very basics)or anything like that As soon as you wake up in the crashed plane you have the freedom to do whatever it is you want No time constraints or anything like that This is what i love about the game! Nothing is worse than having a 30 minute opening tutorial to explain that you have to eat/sleep/drink in order to survive Alsono stupid plot points that open up more content Like doing a certain part of the story in order to craft fire arrows or whateverlike craftable/findable itemscome every 15 days I think it is Something like that There are a few items that have no use Snowshoes for example I would imagine that you will need them in the snow areasbut in the games current state they aren't needed at all I see this as a good thing It means there's alot more tweaking and game mechanics to be implementedI will leave this out of the review Plenty of other reviews cover this subject I'm sureit all comes down to if it's worth the money or not In it's current stateI have gotten my moneys worth of enjoyment out of the game many times over With more content and updates being added on a regular schedule It will only get more enjoyableI hope that the developers of this game will see this review Please don't give up on this game Please please continue to work on it and add on to it This has to be my absolute favorite game to play with friends and with my Fiance It keeps us interestedit definitely keeps us laughingbut I can't help to wonder and wish that it will become so much more than what it is This game has SO much potentialand already it is doing extraordinarily good I feel like we haven't even come close to exploring all that there isbut I can only hope that this easily becomes a game like Skyrim was for me A game where I can spend hours and days on end just playing and enjoying this game Great workguys Keep it up!!The Forest is hands down the best Alpha game I have ever purchased With that being saidi'd like to list the pros and cons of the gameI thought it would just be another one of those build a castle and live forever kind of games I was wrongthankfully In The Forestyou can build incredible structuresbut the enemies make your life difficult regardless of how good your defenses are Want to eat but your food reserves are low? Too bad! There's a raiding party of 6 cannibals outside yelling at you about your destruction of the environment The more you cut down trees and kil cannibalsthe more enemies will come for you It's like the EPAbut they're pissed off and want to eat you The cannibals will hound you day and nightand they're crafty little things They will gang up on you from all sides Just when you thnk they've left and it's safe to kill that lizard that's been running from you for a weekthey come out of nowhere and start beating you downand that's it But nopethe developers of The Forest actually made a compelling and interesting story (and it makes sense!) There's bits of lore to find everywhere From cavesto boatsand sometimes just on the ground in select places The game offers lots of foreshadowing and clues to what is really going on there The games ending is just great as well It answers damn near all the questions that I had asked about the gamebut you know what the awesome part is? The ending is not an easy thing to get to! Why is that? Well I'll address it in my next pointand it doesn't matter how much I've explored them I STILL get spooked when I go into a cave I know I've cleared in search of some cans of coke and some TNT There's an eerie feeling about the cavesbecause they're not just caves; they're breeding grounds and bases for the cannibals There's noises that you think are cannibles breatingwhen in reality it's just sounds from the cave itself Creakingrocks fallingthe occasional maniacle laughter Oh wait that one is the cannibalswho are likely pissed that you're invading their home These caves are also pitch blackdid I mention that? you need to bring a torchor 12 I meanyou really shouldn't go exploring in caves in anything less than full bone armor and the Katana or Modern Axe Nah just kidding You can explore them with only a lighter and your prayersand you'll probably get eaten just the same You know what really sucks though? All the best gear (and gear you need to beat the game) is located in the various cave systemsbuggy mess (it's mostly not) The game is still terrifying and immersivebut now you're able to play it with friends! The scaries part of co-op isn't the cannibals though It's guarding your food from your friend with the appetite of an elephant and the hunting skills of a quadriplegicsome cannibals might show up to fight you This isn't a problem when you have traps though! You know what is a problem? The cannibals seem to have the deductive reasoning abilities of a brain dead alpaca when faced with traps GRR GRR and BLEAT BLEAT will run head first into a trap while RAWR RAWR stays behind and watches his two friends get impaled He then decides that it's an amazing idea to do THE SAME THING that they just did It's not as bad now as it used to be in prior patchesbut they still do stupid stuff like thisthe game decides that you'd like to take a 5 story fall into a cave with a Virginia and her babies It doesn't happen oftenand has only affected me in Co-op games thus farbut it's still a massive pain in the ass (or legsas it were)in my opinionis an absolute steal at $15 This game gets a 9/10 from me I took off a point because of the annoying bugs and glitches that occasionally happen It is almost perfectbut missed the margin of perfection by just a hair If you don't yet own the gameI would encourage you to get it It's great by yourself and even better with friendsFor my first 15 hours in the game (And not watching any tutorials/ walk-troughs that spoil the story) I've learnt a few thingsThis game has oodles of potential Nothing more romantic than strolling down a sunset beach being chased by a bunch of naked cannibals Makes you feel like a celebrityif you are patient: You don't mind set backsand have a good sense of humour Get it now It's pretty awesome even with all the flaws Regular updates mean you're generally not stuck too long with one issue of course with each update you'll generally stumble upon something else to perplex you think of it as hurdles But everything looks pretty so that's okayeaten by land sharksdislike leviatating geesebackwards rabbits and other such oddities then I suggest you wait it out till the game is more developedto a near naked oiled up man-thing scooping up the unconsious childthis upsets me somewhat because now I have no one to offer as a peace sacrifice to the natives After he runs off into the bushes with the kid I yell ""SHOULD OF WORN YOUR SAFETY BELT YOU LITTLE SHIT"" I help myself to numerous trays of inflight meals and booze glorious booze that due to some miracle survived the plane crash and are still sitting neatly on seats and shelves I pick up random pill bottles and devour the contents and collect a pedometer from a foothow ironic Lucky for meI am a paranoid survival enthusiast and was wearing my outdoor back pack complete with survival guide in preparation for this very eventgrabbing a conviently placed fire axe fitted snuggly in that slack flight attendants chestI raid a few luggage cases of the non existant passengersmmm sexy panties Wandering the beach at sunsetalchohol lines the beachesnatures natural drink cooler and notice a group of nudists Fuck yes This island is awesome I run up to them waving my drink in greeting The god of Tits and wine has blessed this place!!

They're constantly dying That's because they aren't playing the mind game with the cannibals It's like they know whether you're afraid or not And whether or not you're going to make them eat that club of theirs Being smart is heavily rewarded in this gameand numbers aren't going to be an easy route to victorymost notably when it comes to large mutants and caves I meanI suppose it's difficult for them to pathfind down there sometimesand they aren't going to climb Combined with what seems to be an intimidation systemyou can end up with situations where a large mutant will simply stand there and stare angrily On the other handthere are genuinely unexpectedly 'smart' moments Once a feral cannibal followed me homeand I turned around to see where it was hiding now It popped its head up from behind a rock to peek at me in a humerous fashionreminding me of a ferret or a groundhog Shame they had to end up in the fire pitThis is seriously a real gem NowI don't usually like horror games/films/anything scary because I get minor heart attacks if someone as much as speaks or claps suddenly That being saidmy husband bought this game and I watched him play it I was scared to deathbut the more I watched the more I just couldn't keep my fingers off of it!but keep in mind that it is an alpha gameand I still amnice weather and sound effects and moreand I am completely terrified of them! They have very smoothelegant and agile movementsand they can be very sneaky Watch your back while chopping wood for your constructions!you constantly feel tense and threatened by your sorroundingswhether it's movement in the distancea shadowa rustling of leaves or other soundsand the crafting possibilities are ever improving with new content being added Custom building can be slightly buggybut I'm sure they will fix it and add to itprobably not knowing that it already exists At the start screensimply type ""veganmode"" and you will not see any cannibals at all This allows you to just enjoy yourself in peace if you feel like surviving and building You may also type ""vegetarianmode""if you wish for the cannibals to only be out at nightgiving you a breathing space during the day This is very lovelybut as I also briefly saidit is very very buggy and laggy Hopefully they will fix itwhich I feel confident that they will Alsoyou should note that there are currently saving problems with co-op The host can save the game while in multiplayerbut your co-player won't be able to join the game again after quitting The host can continue the game in solo modebut not with friends This is a shame I very much hope they will fix this soon [EDIT: I just managed to re-join a game that my husband had hosted earlierso maybe it is possible HoweverI started back in the airplane each time I rejoined Either wayI'm sure all of this will be smoothed out eventually]glitchyblah blah It's alphait's to be expected I don't think there are any game breaking bugs or glitchesthough If something is buggedI haven't experienced not being able to fix it with a quick reload of the gamewhich would give the game some more sense of purpose For nowit's justscavengebuildeatdrinkfight - survive But I enjoy that :)and I think some cannibal buildings also are in different places) I don't necessarily dislike thiseven though a new world every time would make exploring all the more exciting HoweverI do hope that they make the map quite a bit bigger If they don't you end up knowing the entire island in and out quite quicklyand then there won't be much exploring left to do Making the island itself bigger would workbut making more islands to explore using your raft or whatever would be even more awesome I have high hopesbut we'll see what the devs have in store for us :)the game still seems to be far off beta I am not sure how long we will have to wait However long it isthoughI am completely sure that the end result will be breathtaking in every aspect Keep up the good workdevsyou are doing so well!but this is all I can think of for now I may update my review as more additions are made to the game OverallThe Forest is a keeper 10/10 shining stars from me despite the bugs and what not I would highly recommend anyone who like survival/sandbox/horror games to buy this game - also during early access The devs are clearly putting the money to good useso I feel good about having offered them some support at this early stage In factI was very surprised at how cheap it is It almost feels like I robbed them!Buy it Now- DIFFICULTY -Game goodsolo fun! coop funny! why waste time say lot word when few word do trick"

Does it make sense?Just nominated this for the test of time awardand for a good reason!a lot of balancing work went into it and new civs were added that fit into the game nicely and enrich the overall experience while still staying true to the coreit doesn't need you to have korean progamer levels of apm to enjoy itand it still is!takes me back to when life was simple come home from school run up the old pc and play age of empires till i was told to go bed this game will always have a special place in my heart 11/10This was the game that got me interested in history Still as good as it was 20 years ago An absolute blast to play And guess what? It must have done something right because now I'm a history teacherEasily my favorite gameuse to play on the disc when I was a lot youngerstarted playing about 10 years ago Found steams HD version and I've never been happier about finding a gameOh boywhere do I begin? I've been playing this game since it was released as a demo for maximum pc back in 1998 My father showed me it at a computer store that he used to work at in the small community that we used to live in I was only 4 years old at that timeand I remember the only civilizations you could be were the Brits and Celts I first laid eyes on the scout calvarywould ignore the shit out of everything elsebecause he looked cool in my eyes at 4 years of age Since thenIve been playing this game on and offI'm 21 nowand I still find myself latched on to it I now have a daughter of my ownalthough she won't know what it was like to see the game evolve over the course of 16 yearsshe will still know how it came to beassuming she would even find it as cool as I have growing up I think for me at least it was the growing anticipation of seeing something new with every civwhile still keeping the basics of the game simple and the same in it's own ways I used to play this during lunch break in middle school from 2006-2009 with all of my friendsfor the most partI came out on topeven had our own little community of playersformed our own cluband we made a board game out of it It was pretty cool that not all of us were premature nerds that played thisat least half of our little community were jocks that just loved it as much as we didand there was no discrimination involved in any of it  We amassed to a total of 20 or more people in this communityand for a small amount of usour community is still strong with new members and old This game is called Age of Empires IIand it will stand the test of time for the ages I'm happy and delighted that people are still playing this game 16 years laterand we're still finding newcomers for this game at as faster rate than before I've come to realize that just since early 2014 I have ended up spending hundreds of hours playing this gameteaching people both young and old what to do in this game I'm so thrilled to see that this game is coming out with new expansions still to this dayeven after 16 years I think that if I were to find the gold edition realeased back in 2004 without the package being opened or tornI would keep it as a collector's itemthis game has so much potential and I'm happy to see that it's not being thrown away in to the trash I honestly believe that when I die of old ageassuming that I don't die any other wayI will more than likely have a copy in my coffin for when my body gets discovered generations laterpeople will know what kind of influence this game had on my life as much as anyone else's life I honestly didn't even play the Conqueror's expansion pack until 2007even though I knew about it unpon release datemy mother refused me video gamesso I never got to play it on time like most of my friends didbut I knew that I would at some point in time Due to my parents seperation back in 2001 shortly after my mother's mother diedI ended up living with my motheras she got the majority of custody except on holidays when I would be with my father Whenever I was with himhe would let me play gameseven though it was against my mother's wishes I really loved playing as the CeltsBritonsFranksGothsand Vikingsat the timethey were my favorite Now and again howeveryou will find me riding along Genghis Khan's horde as the Mongolshoweveryou can also find me still enjoying the company of the Goths and Britions I love all of the civilizations very muchI know that they all have their strengths and weaknessessome are greater than others My best advice to you is to rush your enemies into the dirt while still keeping up with your economy via micro manage I would rate this game a solid 10/10 and would also highly recommend it to anyone who still finds the old RTS game to be complexed and fun I can't wait for the new expansion to come out November 5th 2015 African Kingdoms will have without a doubt in my mind as many new features as it pre successors I hope you all have a try at this gameit's for sure my favorite game of all timeThis game has long been a childhood favorite It was the first game I ever bought and owned for the PC I played a lot of this gamemainly singleplayer back in 2006but scratched the CD a couple years later When I found it had been remastered on Steam I was quick to purchase myself a copy and have been playing both singleplayer and multiplayer since For those of you who used to own a copy like myselfI highly advise purchasing this digital editionas it offers both the same nostalgic gameplay and a great strategic outlet The Forgotten DLC also gives you more to explore and adds even greater variety to an already extensive game I highly recommend this titleas it has quickly (re)become a personal favoriteit was one of the older RTS games dating back to the late 90s / early 21st century I'm surprised more people don't play it You are given a wide selection of civilizations with specific perks eachand try to race each other towards an objectivebe it a Wonder RaceDeathmatchor King of the Hill All of which are great fun! What really stands out with this game is that there are hundredsif not thousands of ways to win Grantedthe mechanics may seem simple and outdatedbut when trying to runn an entire empire with 200+ units against up to seven other playersevery click counts as you try to out-maneuverout-thinkand out-micro your opponent The graphics may take a while to get used tobut what you really should look forward to enjoying is the satisfaction of wrecking the strong defenses of an enemy with allies or aloneand conquering lands one by one A great titleI also highly advise purchasing this for the newer communityGame's so good that it gets new expansions 17 years after releaseCRTL + C to close the ""Validating Subscriptions windows"" and get into the main menuWhen I was a child I would play this game Now I bought it a second time because I want to be a child again  This is a game where you make an Empire that lasts through the Ages  Also when a friend of mine was telling me about this game when I was in third gradehe thought that it was called Agent Vampires  A game that has nothing to do with agents or vampires  Anywaygood game if you have friends who also want to be kids again===[ â¤ Audience: ]===[u]Old but Gold[/u][b][i]""WOOLOOLOOO""[/i][/b]this series has been over here for almost TWO FREAKING DECADES In 5 months it'll be 20 years and people still want part 4 which most probably never come Since the last part it's been over 10 years Do you guys even remember that book which was released by Microsoft Studios which showed up AoE 4 and 5? I guess we all believe there was suppose to be 4/5 Wasn't it actually Bill Gates who said he'll look into that (answer for question what's up with AoE 4?)growing or just lifetime in general as a gamer? That game was (is) incredible 13 years later instead of Age of Empires IV we've recieved HD remaster It's easier to remaster something that was already done than create something new right? Times of remastersthis remaster wasn't bad at all There are several pros Most importantlyfan base Secondly actual game at Steam Store (no idea if there was SD editionif so write in comment please) Another pros contains working and great multiplayeractual HD and the fact that you can just relive it all once againthat contains another campaign that  contains another campaign and same with The Conquerors + respective DLC content So if you don't feel to play Skirmish yet or Scenarios or just free build then do campaign But Skirmish at least for me is main element why I've played this game And of course you start with nothingnowhereuneducated paesant and end up kinging your own Empire that will crush your enemies like nothingbuildingsunits and everything just like good old times Wonders are spectacular Architecture of new DLCs is also really beautiful (NoI'm not hard on DLC content whatsoever) Game also have various game modes such as King of the HillWonder DefenseWonder DestroyingRelic CapturesDM and lot moresomebody is still going to enjoy it even after 500 hours I'm on over 150 at the momentand I must say I'm really exhausted So do your mathsometimes laggy as hell sometimes smooth as I don't knowskin of some smooth human being However it also depends on what you like Me personally I don't like big farming and just rushing everythingso I enjoy more playing MP with all friends in lobby so there's no serious rush But if you like opposite then hop into that MP or SP with hard CPU and it will be your heaventhat's not Achievement for me Achievement should expose every element of the game possible Achievement should cover every existing aspect of the game or action you can done without holding you inside game for too long So if anybody thought it would be wise to put achievements like these in Age of Empires II HD was clearly nuts Yes it covers everythingbut it fairly exceeded anything saneGod created computers so that Age of Empires II could be played on themFirst time to play AoE II was in 1999but this one's still therea masterpiece across the agesPlaying FFA Regicide with friendsalliancesand betrayalmy city falls and I brace myself for defeatI see a message: ""Anon has changed their status with you to ally""I begin to rebuild my empireI see another messagemocking my defeatAge of Empires ll HD is one of the best Building Strategy Games  IÂ´ve ever played!! Neither Offline or Onlineyou will have a lot of Fun So to to this Game I only can give a full recommendationI think it's worth the moneyI have good memories of my dad teaching me how to play this RTS nearly 20 years ago  Almost 20 years later at this moment in time (1/07/2018) there are a total of 18423 players currently In-Game  This stat should help to explain just how amazing this game truly isStarcraft and Command and Conquer  It would not surprise me if this game is still just as popular another 10 years from nowwhen I will have the privilege of sharing this experience with my kids somedayIt's okbut I think I need to play it a bit more to be sure  Cautious thumbs up"
1,"I don't usually play action roguelikes... I'm in my 50s and my reflexes aren't the honed blades they used to be. Yetafter all the positive reviews I decided to give this game a goandboyam I having fun. SureI suck... 30odd escape attempts and the furthest I got is the bossfight in Elysiumbut it's such a great game that I don't care. There's always something new to discover or progress to be made. Highly recommended![i]""One more run""[/i]just one more""[/i]maybe one more on top of that""[/i]one more and I'm done""[/i]I want to do another run""[/i]just let me do one more run""[/i]I thought I didn't like Rougelike's before Hades...

Adjustment to the ""progress"" in the one placeperhaps some slight balancing elsewhere... But does it matter when taking everything into account? Nopenot at all.Somehowsome waySuperGiant managed to accidentally provide the best example of Games as a Service working by virtue of having the most intelligent Early Access schedule I have ever seen.complementing each system in place before and each system in place adapts to the new pieces.  This feels like a puzzle that has no bordersand every time you get new pieces they just fit cleanly along the edge of the old to grow an even biggercooler picture.but then on top of that it's such a damn good game.  Combat feels incredible.  Everything feels fair.  Variable difficulty options and the bevy of interesting unlocks postfirstwin are a delight.  There seems to be no end to little additions and new gameplay layers around every corner just when I think I have seen everything they're gonna throw at me (even if I haven't unlocked it all yet).  It's all so nuanced and delivered at such a perfect pace that I just can't keep myself from doing One More Attempt day in day out.and while there are clear powerhouse options you'd wish you saw every runeverything else is so useably good that you don't really notice when you don't get the OP options.  Ohdid I mention the combat was fun?  So are nearly all the variations and Roguelike RNG options.  On top of thatthe expected god tier (ha) quality of writingmusicvoice actingand storytelling from Supergiant is in full force.  Add that to the depth of interaction layers woven into the fightdierepeat loop directly as part of the lorewhich is done so remarkably smoothlyand you would not be wrong to wonder why not everyone on the planet follows in Supergiant's footsteps from here on out for roguelikesand in a more broad sensefor Early Access as well.This is Supergiant Games' magnum opus.however since I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Supergiant Games' previous titlesI gave this a chance.am I glad that I did  this game is just fantastic.  The art style is beautiful with brilliant character designs.  The soundtrack is excellentthe voice acting is spoton and the sound effects are great too.  The story is interwoven with your repeated deathsprogressing multiple plot threads and relationships on every run.fastpaced combat that takes cues from Bastion and Transistorbut dialled up to 11with the branching narrative of Pyre but with tons more replayability as the insane numbers of weapon upgradesboons/perks ensure that every run is different.musicsound designstory) all mesh together perfectly.you can pet the big dogI don't know why this Fishing Simulator needed such a deep narrative and ballin' soundtrackswhich I at first refrained frombecause there is WAY TOO MUCH to say about this game. 125+ hours in49/49 achievements unlockedand I can hands down say that [b][i]Hades[/i] is the best independent game I have [b]ever[/b] played[/b]the greatest roguelite game and definitely in the top spots of all games I've playedwithout any doubt or exaggeration. [i]Supergiant Games[/i] went all outand it shows. [i]Hades[/i] is definitely their Magnum Opus. While I'm on the topic of [i]Supergiant Games[/i]I can HIGHLY recommend watching the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzyE9hi912c&list=PLTHgg8QnvU4JEVov1tMlFThNYS92F8uC]Hades  Developing Hell[/url] Documentation by Noclip. I've watched it twice already and it gives great insight into [i]Supergiant Games'[/i] team and their process of developing [i]Hades[/i]. They are proving yet again that they are the small team with the biggest guns. [i]Hades[/i] winning over 100 awards for numerous independent and action genre achievementsdozens of Game of the Year awards from major publisherscurrently sitting at 117600 reviews with 98% being positiveand being the [url=https://steamdb.info/stats/gameratings/]2nd Highest Rated Game of all time on Steam[/url]is [b]really[/b] showing that their efforts didn't go to waste.utterly enjoy every single aspect of [i]Hades[/i]. I don't even know where to begin. This game just makes you crave for more. [i]Just one more run. Just one more run and I'll go to sleep.[/i]isometric art and animations are gorgeouswith everything being handdrawn to perfectionit strikes a perfect balance between visual flair and precise clarity needed to execute complex combos. Everywhere you lookeverything you see is just so damn gorgeous and so pleasing for eyes. The art style is a perfect match with the Greek mythology themeand each character just screams with their respective personalities. All of the visual effectsalthough sometimes overbearingreally establish a great identity that will vary in each run and makes the game so aesthetically pleasing.and evolving more upon dyingwas incorporated very cleverly. You just get hookedevery run you learn more and more about why all of this takes placeit's just satisfying. All of this is so expertly drenched in myths and gravitas of the Greek mythologywhere you can feel that it was meticulously researchedthat it creates a very rich and immersive experience for the player.which is very well written; it brilliantly incorporates humorintrospectionsternnessplayfulnessetc. There are more than 20000 lines of dialogue in this gameand quite some bigger AAA studios can definitely learn a thing or two from the completeness of [i]Hades'[/i] dialogue. It's all just so fun to listen tothe protagonist Zagreus alone bears a classic drysardonic wit of late youth that breaks on occasion when his trespasses donâ€™t go entirely according to plan. The progression and the development of characters and their relationships to Zagreus is perhaps the best I've ever seen in this particular genrehelleven in bigger titles. They all range from wise and levelheaded to boisterous and sillyand the Greek pantheon in particular has some wonderfully clever takes on the classic deities. More than anythingthoughis how relatable all of them come off as. This isnâ€™t some grim epic or intense dramaitâ€™s a guy trying to get out from under his dadâ€™s thumb and running into all their mutuals along the way. Some want to help himsome want to kill himand some just think the whole thing is too damn funny. Itâ€™s a very human castand theyâ€™re an absolute delight to behold.sharp and well built. It just ð•—ð•–ð•–ð•ð•¤ ð•˜ð• ð• ð••. ""Addicting"" does not even remotely describe it. It is so seamlessyet so effectivewithout talking down to you and holding your hand. You're given a fine selection of weapons and attacks and an incredibly versatile dash by default. Each one can be upgraded/altered with different boons the gods will grant you. Boons can modify your attacks or provide dramatic passive effects to bolster different aspects of your strategy; Zeus' lightning emitting from your attacksDionysus' wine hangover hurting foes for a prolonged timeAthena giving you the ability to deflectHermes providing you with extra dashes and so many more. Zagreus can be an absolute blur on the battlefieldconstantly dashingslashingand bashing foes while weaving in and out of dangerand for my part the game does a fantastic job of keeping this highspeed mayhem manageable. It almost reminds of DOOM in a wayhow the incredible speed and versatility of your character is balanced against huge numbers of enemies that will absolutely kill you if you make the mistake of standing still.each time you go back to startyou're given the opportunity to acquire meaningful permanent upgrades which change the way you play and subsequently make things easier. When you finally master [i]Hades[/i] or have enough upgrades to give that edge in escapingyou may set the difficulty higher to go back to sweating bullets and getting new rewards. I really didn't expect to keep unlocking both gameplayrelated items and story events 90+ hours into the gameand yet that's exactly what happened.all the stuff mentioned above is already top notch.

It's not all one big adrenaline rush thoughthe slowermore thoughtful pieces are pretty damn soothing. The OST album can definitely stand on it's ownwhile providing the perfect audio companion to the gameplay. Darren Korb can have every single one of my future babies. This man cannot be stopped. Composing one of the most captivating scores I've ever witnessed in a video gamein addition to voicing the protagonist (+more)is there anything this man can't do?and it's a testament to what [i]Supergiant Games[/i] can do. [i]Hades[/i] went above and beyond in it's designit's safe to say that this game is a masterpiece. All of this for just 20 bucks? Insane. [b]âˆž/10[/b]. Will buy againSwitch physical edition inbound.[b]YOU CAN PET CERBERUS!!![/b]Just... One... More... Run...Before I played HadesI had a small penisno friendsno girlfrienddepressionand absolutely no life. These things haven't changedbut the game is pretty good.[h3][i]Adventure Through The Underworld[/i][/h3]the Greek mythologythemed game released one year agoand that purely conquested our hearts has players.OdysseusHerculesPerseusor even Herculesbut yes Zagreusson of Hades. Howeverour young prince sees the Underworld position as overrated and desires to leave and join the rest of his family at Mount Olympus. To perform this impossible task and go against his father's willZag needs to climb all the Underworld. Luckilyour hero is a fearsome warriorready to take any challengemastering six Infernal Armssome legendary weapons well known. Alsoas can be expectedthe Olympus Gods didn't stay indifferent to the newssending their support to Zagreus.but Hades in that aspect is phenomenal. The narrative will move the same way in the victories and losses. Having when Zag gets back homecharacters making fun of himand some giving motivational speeches. It's always good to get down there again to have a good chat with someone.but never for its combat. HoweverHades feels fluid enough to be satisfying. As referred beforethere are six different weaponseach having four unlockables aspects. Every infernal arm has a different play stylehaving its own primary and special attackgiving a lot of variety to the game. Without forgetting that gods are watching usthere are the boons. Upgrades sent in lightspeed from the Olympus to support Zagreus. These boons are passives that make our princefor examplegive more damage for attack or move fasterand when connected to the right weaponscan make a run three hundred times easier.mostunlike boonsmaintain with Zagreus after completing a runused for several thingslike upgrades and cosmetics. It's something that I don't bother withbut stillI think that there isn't a need to have soo much. I would enjoy Hades the same way if there were only half of the artifacts.and oh myit's beautiful. It doesn't fail any possible expectation about it. It presents a junction of 2D and 3Dwith the pillars popping up to your eyes. Animations and movements look soft and clean. And the character designforget itit's another level.and I think that's enough to say that I still listen to the OST today.and who enjoys roguelikes that doesn't touch this gameor says that's baddoesn't know what is saying.00 GB Ram[/i]Hello all.permadeath games usuallyI have to say i'm very impressed with this game.fun and a little addictive. The runs themselves last about 3060mins but the story and dialogue just keeps on going. Fail the first time and come back strongerunlock skills and so much more to make your next run much more easierand for those who like it difficult have the ability to crank it up a notch once you have completed your first run.no bugs or glitches just very clean.the achievements alone will keep you locked in this game for hours n hoursI love it!worth every penny. Impressive.I don't like roguelikes ( or roguelites). Don't get me wrongI've tried! I'll buy some wellreviewed game like Enter the Gungeonboot it upplay for an hour or twothen let it sit in my library until time immemorial. It's a cycle I was loath to repeat which is why despite enjoying the rest of Supergiant's games I stayed away from Hades for about a year.rocking soundtrackand tight combat( or about how Cerberus is a good boy). These are all trueand if you already like the roguelike genre should sell you on this gamebut if you're like me that's not enough. The reason I've played more of this game than any other roguelike is because of Supergiant's ability to combine story and gameplay. In a lesser gamepicking up a powerup consists of a menu screen or a short visual cuebut in Hades picking a boon means learning more about the crazy gods on mount olympus. Is Poseidon jealous of Zeus? Does Athena resent Ares? Is Dionysis drunk?  You'll get to experience all of these little dramas and more as you progress through a runbut where Hades really sets itself apart from the rest of genre is what happens after a run.it's like coming home.from hypnos the sleepy doormanyour mentor Achillesto mother night herself. Not to mention the adorable housekeeper. Sometimes it's not about Zagreusbut the relationships all of these colorful characters have which each other which will develop over each failure as you return to the house of Hades. Afterwards I can unlock new weapons (or weapon aspects)new powerupsor see the new items I've collected and prepare for my next run. It's a thoroughly satisfying loopso even if you don't think this is your type of gameyou should give it a shot.Hades is one of the best roguelites of alltime. Gameplay is fast and full of never ending action. The boons that you earn in each dungeon significantly alter your abilities in interesting ways. There's a great deal of replayability due to random generated mapsrandom skills you get each run and different skillsets. Boss fights are hard and require a lot of focus but they are not tedious at allon the contrary they're very engaging. Hades does a great job of balancing fun and challenge.Supergiant returns with a masterpiece.with a roguelite one. Don't let the title fool youyou won't be playing as Hades; you'll be playing his son Zagreus who decided that he wants to run away from home. ""But wait!"" I hear you say. ""Hades never had a son! And Zagreusif even mentionedis just an aspect of Dionysus!"" And you'd be right! Supergiant actually did their Greek mythology research to the point where in a few thousand yearsthe story of this gamecould even seem as a legit myth from the period that addresses that little identity crisis in a meta sense. Big applause for this! Other than thatof coursekeeping the game family friendlysome details of the Olympian family tree had to be left out.this game will have you repeatedly fight out of the land of the deadcollecting resources and upgrades as you goso you can press further next time. The difficulty curve is up to the player  if you're strugglingyou can activate the ""God Mode""; which will give you some damage resistance and stack a bit of it on top every time you die. If you want to selfflagellatethen there's ""Hell Mode""; which will put you against extra challenges with tougher and more plentiful foesright off the bat! Once you finish a run onceyou can stack such challenges onto your run freely for additional rewards. It's fastpacedbut never makes you feel you're under time pressureand the number of builds you can go for with different weapons and boons from Olympian gods is vastso don't get too focused on a single playstyle.it's another brilliant entry into the Supergiant collectionand the banter between the characters never gets tedious. Alsospoiler alert: You can pet Cerberus! All lines are fully voicedand they even breathe some personality into each Hellenic person of myth. And the overarching quest would be a spoilerbut suffice to sayZagreus has good reasons to try and run away from home...and also good reasons to always end up back there.as we've been learning to expect from these hoopy froods at Supergiant. All in allit's a worthy purchaseandand I can't believe I'm saying thisbut I actually wish I'd bought this one in Early Access. Definitely recommended to anyone who enjoys a good roguelite.ofc...I got everything! Everything. I got every single thing. I can't get any more upgradesbountiescontractsminor propheciesthe codex is full. I got everything. This game is incredible to get lost inagain and again and again. I couldn't recommend it enough to anyone whose a fan of roguelikesgreek mythologytwin stick shootersand gays. 10/10I WANT MORE! maybe a DLCplease?Its their best game yet  the gameplaycharactersmusicits absolutely unparalleled. The fact it's not even finished yet astonishes me  this is already perfect enough"
1,Base game itself doesn't offer too much.Install)Review is based on gameplay with G2U want a honest review?sooo yea i have 4000hrs in this and yes i have played this since it first came out(i have time to kill im retired basically).mind you this sim is almost 8yrs oldgoes on sell quite often (after you have setup your wheel and pedals properly or with controller or keyboardAND get your FOV dialed in)well its age shows right there :whooze:does just fine though some cars do feel extremely glued to the road or have broken aerodynamics or just drive like bricks ( so if u think ur going to just get in a Mclaren P1 and do some drifts like u seen on a few yt videos... well best of luck)but hey nothing is perfect especially something this old still does better than games like gts or pc2-3 imoCSP (Custom Shaders Patch)CM (Content Manger)PPF (PostProcessingFilters) this sim looks like it belongs in a game trailer from this yeardont believe me? Just go inside the Screenshot channels of a DECENT AC discord server and look.im not going to get into detail about because it would take forever to explain but to put it as short as possible there are some mods that look and drive worse than stock AC and there are mods that are just so much fun and everything feels natural u can get lost in this sim for hrs and hrsjust ask around in a DECENT AC discord server or go to RaceDepartmentodds are you'll end up in argument with kids or adults who should honestly get off and get a job.No one will ever read this but I recommend this gameI'm not very good at reading Steam descriptions. I somehow managed to miss the part where this was a simulatorand believed it would be a Forza-style racing gameor maybe a Gran Turismo experience. I wasn't prepared for the depth of simulation presented in this game. I had no racing equipmentnot even a steering wheel. I did not enjoy the game.do some drifting and jump out. It's an in-depth driving game with realistic vehicles and handling. It is recommended to get racing sim equipmentbut you don't have to. Don't make the mistake I didand make sure you figure out whether Assetto Corsa is right for you. If youunlike meare interested in an intense and realistic racing experiencethis is the game for you.Played in VR and it is extremely immersive. Crashed at 300+kmgot whiplashand went into shock. Woke up three weeks later from a coma with my kidneys gone? Anyway 10/10 great game.If you are using a wheelthis is the best racing game made so far. The physics feels great.my girlfriend left me.The game cost mewhat$30? I've heard people can get it for less.Custom Shader Patch (they're togethernow)Assetto Corsa is a must-have.and I can race them anywhere in the world.maybe $30?you like carsfairly good physicsgreat graphicsendless content that is mostly free?Great game.. Fantastic realism and drifting.. only downside is my parents got divorced but id really recommend.*UPDATED to .21*one of the best racing sims out there. definitely recomendable.the car is so predictable that you can even go sideways playing with a mouse. Dont get me wrongyou really NEED a wheel to enjoy this game. Almost every car is easy to drive in your confort zonetry to go above it  to earn some tenths and it will become tricky before you lose the control of the car.the Green Hell as dlc in October I thinkcorners performance..)mod soundmod tracks (one of high quality alreadycrappy ports too)and mod cars (soon* already released good ones: shelby cobra and gp2).you answerthey give (list of wanted cars and traks) and you askthey answer (if you have some problem)time atack modedrift and drag mode too. *multiplayer is enjoyable alreadyyou have some jump in and drive servers and more serious onesthe AI needs a bit of agresivity tuningnow avoids you an doesnt defend its position. The devs have said to v1.0 there will be 2 sliders for strenth and agresivity. Multiplayer have some lacks but it was  released this friday so it will be better for sure.is not possible to have another light source than the Sunso no night races yet. You can race from sunrise to sunset with dynamic time and stuffseeing the perfection of the grip simulation I'm sure it will be top-notch thobut what multiplayer game doesnt have them? (btw i've only seen one in 150hthe rest is just lack of experience)buy ityou wont regret itSpent 1000 Hours playing Assetto Corsa since 2016and I still have the same - first month's - hype and excitement when I hop on a server. This game is the best Racing/Drifting Simulator Game Because:if not the biggest.even though its a 2014 gamea 5 Y/O pcand new PC that I bought just to play this game in VR )but Im writing this one Because I Recommend this game for any Car Enthusiast.The base game of assetto corsa isn't the reason many players love this game. For sureit has a lot of good content and you could be content with just playing the game stockbut the real experience comes in mods. Do you want a picture-perfect recreation of the tokyo highway system? A full set of 70s touring cars? A realistic rally mode? You can get all of those on the internet. This game has essentialy unlimited contentand that is what makes it great.Assetto Corsa. In shortbuy this game if you have a wheeland if it's on salebut only buy the ultimate edition. The base game itself is very lacking in content. So I recommend you get [url=https://assettocorsa.club/content-manager.html] Content Manager [/url] too. It makes downloading mods [b] much [/b] easier. You probably also want a lot of modssince the number of cars are limited in the base game. Here's some sites I recommend:carsAssetto Corsa is basically a pure perfection. It is one of the best racing games/simulators ever made.I am a casual gamer. I play racing games with a gamepadand with all assists on. And despite the fact that Assetto Corsa is labelled as a hardcore driving simulatorin realitythis is an extremely accessible gameeven for fans of arcade racing games like me.do yourself a favor and buy Assetto Corsa. Don't bother with that abomination called Project CARS. I had extremely high hopes for Project CARS series. It seemed that these games had everything - beautiful graphicsamazing soundsplenty of tracks and cars to drive... But to my disappointmentcars and handling in Project CARS games are utter garbage. Physics are a complete joke. Every second car spins out when exiting from the cornerand playing these games with the gamepad is impossible. Not to mention super toxic online communityand tons of fanboys who defend pCARS despite its horrible flaws.as well as responsive brakesand overall behavior.if you install community-made modssuch as CSPSol and Horizonthe Assetto Corsa will look better than any other racing gaming currently available on the market.this game has thousands of mods! You can mod everything. Everything! You can mod graphicsweatherinstall new carsinstall new tracksadd new liveriesadd custom appscreate new championshipsdrive on free roam maps... You can even install HUD from Initial Dand drift on Akagi mountain roads with Toyota AE86!the Assetto Corsa is still a truly amazing gamedespite the fact that it's seven years old. It features tons of contentand is super accessible both for arcade racing driversas well as for sim racing drivers. The Assetto Corsa Competizione is the best GT3 racing game ever made. Howeverthe Assetto Corsa is currently a more feature-rich game thanks to the amazing community which supports it. I think the future of this series is brightespecially since it's able to offer an incredible driving experienceeven if you are a complete racing noob like me.---{ Graphics }---my wife left mebest driving sim everSol 2.1custom shaders patchLA CanyonsUnion IslandMulholland Driveany racetrack by LilSki (racedepartmente.g. Road AmericaWatkins Glen)i am wanted on  counts of vehicular homicide in the first degree
1,"I am not a big gamer.  I'm old.  Over 50.  When I purchased a new computer recentlywanting to take it for a spinI asked my son what to do and he told me about Steam.  As an ancient history buff (I'm also a writer and have written a novel about the ancient SpartansI did searches on Greece and Rome and eventurally found Rome 2.a lot of gamers just can't wait today.I love Rome 2.  When I read about the Emperor's Edition having worked out most of the problemsI dove in.  It's been a delight.  What a great game.  It's more addicting that crack.  Being able to play so many different factions gives it limitless re-playability.  Thus far I've played as the RomansSpartansAthenians and Epirusand have had a blast with each.  There is a huge amount of strategy and tactics available on both the campaign map and the battle maps.  Placing your armies at choke points in the mountains or at river crossings... putting them in ambush mode... slaughtering 2x or 3x your number of units without getting your hands dirty... it's all so gratifying.eventually I'll start kicking out armies composed of better units than my opponents.  When the autoresolve gives me results I don't likesaying I'm going to loseor take unexceptable lossesit's fun to take control of your army and lead them on to victory when the oddsmakers are betting against you.  Of courseoften times you're leading superior units against hordes of untrained spearmen or leviesbut occasionally the computer gives you a run for your money and there's nothing like destroyng your opponents Praetorian guard or Oathsworn unit that fights to last man.I found the Workshop and have been in pure amazement at the products the community has added to the game.  The 4x moves per year modagent color codingthe new unit modsand many others deserve effusive praise.  I feel like a kid on Christmas morning every time I look in the Workshopwondering what new toy I'll find under the tree today.okaythere are somebut I'm like a newlywed on his honeymoon right now.  I don't care if she leaves her panties on the bathroom floor or that the 4x calendar year mod makes agents overpowered.  For right nowI'm enjoying the game far too much to complain about a thing.Rome wasn't built in a day. It took 5 years and 18 patches.This game received a lot of negativity when it came out. I didn't play it at release so a large percentage of the hate was probably well deserved. In the end thoughI really feel this title is one of the best in the series. I think the battle AI is the best of the series (still haven't played Attila though. The game looks and sounds beautiful in all aspects.it really makes sense. You can still recruit troops away from a city and they magically appear in the queue on the next turn within your army which means they ARE marching from one location to another...you just aren't the one doing it.it was a file that somehow got corrupted and simply verifying the integrity of the game cache resolved it entirely.the campaigns I have played in this game have been some of the best to date and I highly recommend this title to anyone interested in historical strategy. To those who love this series but haven't played this game yet? I say give it a try and give it more than just a few turns. Put a few hours into it before calling it quits.Game is worth it on sale for 17$  but not 71$ its 7 years old you gouging bastardsI guess there were some serious issues at launch but Rome II - EE is a pretty great TW game. There are issues with the game becoming a major slog mid-late gameonce you've pretty much dominated your neighborsbut the combat is fun and the graphics look good. Some people don't like how resources are now managed at the province leveland you can no longer build every little town into a rival of Romabut reallyit's a non issue once you get the hang of managing food and learning what to build and where.from minor music enhancementsto complete overhauls. This certainly extends the replayability of the game once you get done with the included scenarios (which are goodespecially teutoburg forest.I don't understand how I bought the ""Definitive edition"" of a game and still have over Â£90 of DLC to buySince the release of the Rise of the Republic DLCyou can no longer mod the game. Agent behavior and AI player actions can be changed in the game code same as beforebut those changes now for some reason have no effect. After posting questions on the Steam Mod Workshop and also on TWC and waiting three months with zero responsesit seems clear that nobody knows how to fix this.and nobody is answering questions about it on the forumsso this is my only way to express my displeasure about the situation. I really hope someone notices how the mods are being prevented from working right and fixes it. Until then one of my favorite games of all time is off my play list.Good game with a ridiculous price. How is this still $60? I was going to buy it for a friend but not for $60. That is ridiculous.Rome wasn't patched in a day.""Rome wasn't patched in a day""I'm writing this review for new eyes that'll see the 75% discount.there is a steep learning curve. If you've played Civilizationyou won't have a hard time adjustingI think. The tutorials are barebonesand will not prepare you well enough. Take a look at the Total War Academy and go on youtube to see gameplay before purchasing. This game requires prep time before purchasing. Keep that in mindfolks.about the DLC. There are 13 of them. I'll do the math for you. The complete version is $198.86 when not on saleand as of todayMay 14thit would be $64.10. YesI'm including Blood and Gore. Why are blood effects DLC now? What's next? Will the game remain silent until I pay for it? This may sound like a first world problembut this should have been a free update. Reviews on that page will echo this.mods are availablebut this is a review of the base game.and you might like it too.this one's for you.Armed with a new engineRome II looks greatplays smoothlyand will be a challenge to both veterans and novices.Rome 2 was extremely bugged upon release and infuriated countless fansincluding die hard Total War fans. With the release of the Emperor Editionmost of all these bugs and performance problems had been successfully adressedmaking this entry one of the best that Total War had and has ever seen.I still enjoy replaying campaigns just for the heck of it. Meaning bingeplaying for weeks at end and still not getting bored.==[ â¤ Audience: ]===While I adore this gameand applaud CA's work in advancing the mechanics and elements of it's preeminent series on a title to title basisI cannot stand the pay wall antics they've indulged in of late. Leaving X number of factions inaccessible to players is absurdand I have to conclude from the innumerable reviews/rants I've come across expressing this same sentiment that its a poor business practice/decision. You make a more or less singular productwhich subsequently has a more or less singular audience--if the rise of independent game-makers has not left you with the following impression alreadyallow me to reiterate--indys will remake your game and subsequently make it better by catering to the whims of fans--thus depriving you of the user base you now enjoy. If that's the future you envision for your seriesCAby all means keep nickel and dimeing people to vexation. I for one have not purchased any CA title since the release of Rome II and have no plans to do otherwise--unless of course I observe a leaving-off on your part with respect to the aforementioned. I hope this review finds an audiencethough I rather doubt it--I suppose most developers are under the mistaken impression that the gaming community no longer has members willing to boycott a product/series.Rome 2 had a rough startbut has evolved over time to become my favourite Total War.covering all of the major and some of the minor players in this era. They're spread across four large Cultural Groups (RomanHellenicBarbarian and Easterneach of which have different fighting stylesbuildings etc and 9 Cultureseach offering different traits and bonuses. And while factions within the same culture may be similareach still has some unique units and specific challenges that I feel adds to the replayability.(you need the Greek States DLC to play as the likes of AthensEpirus and Spartathough as with all DLC factions you can fight against them in the Grand Campaign without the DLC. I personally don't see it as an issue as in the period the main game is actually set (272BC to 72AD they're already past their glory daysand with the various Successor Kingdoms such as MacedonEgyptand the Seleucids there's still plenty of Greek combat on offer.but still holds up well in my view. and are now tied to a particular General or Admiral (so you recruit from the armynot the settlementsthough what you can recruit is based on the buildings in that province. There's also now a cap on the number of armies and navies each faction can fieldthough this can be increased through Imperium. This means you generally don't have lots of little armies swarming all over the place. And while this does mean there's a small loss of strategic flexibilityI find it also means you have to put more strategic thought into where you place your limited armies.but also penalties for conquering territory and growing your empire. As it gets bigger your Imperium level increasesallowing you to field more armies and agentsas well as enact more edicts (province wide bonuses but also introduces new governance and logistical issues (represented by increases in corruptiondisloyalty and unit upkeep costs.especially since the Power & Politics and Ancestral Updates. Whoever you play you'll find you have one or more other partieswho have their own charactersparty traits (such as liking Barbarianshating Romans or being Pacifists and territory within your empire. Each has a loyalty statwhich then increases or decreases depending on your actions.the characters work the same as the ones from your party. But if their party loyalty falls too low there's a chance a Secession or full blown Civil War will trigger each turncausing part of your empire to break away taking with it any armies and navies lead by their characters (or spawning additional armies/navies if the party doesn't have sufficient military.so you'll never be in a position where you don't have a political opposition for long. Overall it adds a whole additional dimension to the campaignsso the threats you face aren't just from other factionsbut also your own.where the heirs to Julius Caesar such as Octavian and Mark Anthony fought to become the first Roman Emperor. While it reuses many features of the Grand Campaignit's still a fun change of pace to play as or fight against large established Roman factions.it's worth noting it's all completely optional so it's really up to the player what to buy. You only need to buy the DLC to play as that contentnot fight against it in Grand Campaignso for example you'll get to fight against the Nomadic Tribes with their full DLC rosters even if you never buy their DLC.Rome 2 offers a lot of content for the price (which is why I'm still playing 7 years and some 2400+ hours after release so if you're interested in the periodstrategy games or Total War I'd highly recommend it.I've had dreams about conquering the Mediterranean because of this game. I've spent literal months of my life playing this.While I rather enjoyed this gameway back whendespite it's many flawsin 2014 or soI paid less for it then that it costs now.and there is certainly no excuse to price-hike a 7 year old game (it was released in 2013to 60 euro + ~150 euro worth of DLC.75% off sale! The 7 year old game + DLC will only cost you ~65 euro!After 700 hoursI can still say I find this game fantastic. Massive fan of Roman history so it's a big plus for meyes the graphics are getting a little outdated and the AI isn't all that bright but you just cant beat the concept of fighting with armies from that time.where you would have to defend Italy from hordes of slaves or even try to take out Italy fighting as the slaves :Dgreat game! would recommend this for sure.I am giving a quick review because I strongly believe that after what CA did with the game post-release it has become one of my favourite TW games.Varied FactionsNew Province System (Gives you mini-objectives that add some structure to the campaignArmy System and TraditionsGreat audio and musicLots of DLCAgents (They are both too powerful and their risk is not satisfying at allDiplomacy (Better than before but still feels randomLots of DLCWar ElephantsHorse ArchersChariotsHeavy CavalryBallista - So much variety!every TW player must try this game. It is a good starting point for new TW players as it is by far more streamlined than the old games (For better or for worse"
1,"The title is a lieyou die more than twiceWhen I first got the gameI liked it  Then I met the first mini-boss and died a lot  I got better  Watched quite a few walk-throughs and tips videos  I hated everything about it  The I-framesthe enemy fight timingsthe death mechanicsthe Ogreoh! that damnablestinking ogre!  I never hated a character more until I had to fight Lady Butterfly  Then about 20 hours inI just got it  I understood  Then I was able to appreciate the landscapesthe questsand the story line I got my platinum in about 43 hours  I've played through about 38 timesconquered all DLC gauntletsand still love playing it  I can now do a full run through in about 10 hours if I play all the side quests and kill all there is to kill  Still hate the Headless though  1007 hours and still love it  I probably can't play anything else that From Software has nowbut that is okay  I'll still give the Souls series a try at some point  Looking forward to Elden Ringcontrary to popular belief you in fact die way more than twiceSekiro is not a Souls game This can't be stressed enough Attempt to i-frame dodge through the game and you will get your ass slapped all the way back to Lordran While it borrows certain elements from Soulslike the checkpoint system or cryptic NPC questlinesit's pretty much its own beast And what a beast it isbad news situations Good news: the days when you needed to keep an eye on your stamina for every attackblock or dodge are over Bad news: that doesn't mean the game is any less challenging Quite the oppositeactually Wolfie goes down in two hits topsand at all times he's either heavily outnumbered or he gets crushed in the health bar measuring contest And the absence of statsgear and online co-op means there are no shortcuts You won't be able to overlevelno Solaire will come to your aid It's either nut up or shut upthere are ways to put you at a lesser disadvantage Sekiro features a rudimentary stealth system and enough freedom to thin out your enemies' ranks one by one Most of the times you can clear entire areas just by being sneaky ApparentlySekiro started out as a Tenchu game and I totally believe itconsidering how far stealth will get you But eventually a direct confrontation will be unavoidable And where Souls games required you to only land that one parrySekiro demands that you time your blocks near perfectly several times per exchange Combat is fastfluid and demanding enough to make you break a sweatthey are not exactly eyecandy Souls games are known for their sinister beautybut that is largely absent in Sekiro Some areas look flat-out rough Only rarely will you get the urge to stop and soak in the atmosphere A missed opportunityreally And while the environments leave room for explorationthe absence of cool gear makes it feel strangely unrewarding Alsodue to the nature of combat you will see the same instakill moves and finishers quite often A bit of variety would have been niceSekiro faces its own set of challenges Developer From Software has been around for over three decadesbut only since the release of Demon's Souls the studio has gained a larger recognition in the West Ever sincemost of their games have been Souls games either directly or in spirit Being widely known as the developer of Souls games came with the issue that they were expected to make nothing but Souls games - a curseif you will Sekiro marks the first time in a while that a major From Software title branches out far enough to be called its own thing - and be accepted by a large audience With that leap of faith out of the wayit'll be exciting to see what they will come up with nextI was boredand saw that this game won game of the yearso I bought itdying repeatedly to the game's first mini-bossI contacted steam and demanded a refund for a game I simply couldn't playand after finally killing that first mini-bossI couldn't get over how I felt I kept goingperfecting the fighting style until I reached the game's first real boss It knocked me down again I fought that boss over and over again until the swordplay became a lethal kind of dance I felt invincible After the first bossI went onto the next oneand the nextuntil I completed the game's first ending Then I played it all againexploring the abilitiesfighting stylesand story arcs that I hadn't tried before I reached the game's truly final boss and killed it in one try because the game had trained me to fight so well It was by far the most rewarding experience any video game has ever given me After over 150 hoursI earned every single achievementfrom someone who would have never been remotely interested in Japanese culture otherwiselet me tell you that Sekiro is one of a kind Not only is the combat an art-form in and of itselfbut the story is moving and the characters compellingdon't get frustrated when you hit a wall Don't look up cheese strategies or try to savescum the game Get back upwatch a walkthrough or two if you really need toand vault over that wall like a f***ing shinobi You won't regret itNow I just want Bloodborne for PCSekiro is not a game I would easily recommend to those who dislike the Souls games Never in a million years would I recommend this to someone who's totally unfamiliar with difficult action games Nor do I think those who loved the Souls series primarily for it's world designnarrative or multiplayer elements will particularly enjoy this gameSekiro is one of the best games ever madeI instinctively shrugged such complaints off Similar statements were made about all of the previous gamesand they were never true But about 17 hours inafter getting beat by the same boss so many times that I could dodge their moves without even looking at the screenI thought: ""Oh That kind of IS what they're going for this time"" It only became more apparent as I continued to progresswhen you see someone playing an action gameand said person utilizes every possible opportunity to deal damage without missing a beatwhile simultaneously dodging every attackfor upwards of four minutes on an extremely capable enemyyou would assume that this person has mastered the game This sort of capability is what Sekiro expects from [i]all players[/i] as a [i]baseline[/i] In almost all cases[i]must[/i] get to the point where you understand an encounter on an absolute level in order to beat it If you do notyou will diethen you will die againfar more than twiceincluding your toolset I have never seen a game with a higher number of useful toolstechniques and items than Sekiro The Shuriken cuts down those who leap in mid airthe Firecracker stuns the abnormally frantic beast-type enemies and blinds any other enemythe Sabimaru is exceptionally quick and provides poison that not only deals damage over time but inflcits stagger Even something as basic as shards of pottery or a fistful of ash have proved incredibly useful in certain circumstances This is a [i]huge[/i] setup from the Dark Souls series where half of every spell type is totally useless and a quantum leap from Dark Souls 3 where all but two or three weapon arts were complete garbage The reason why these tools are so amazingof courseif that the game expects you to use them With the exception of the basic enemiesnothing you meet will ever be out-right trivialized or even made dramatically easier with these tools--in the way that sayFour Kings could be made easy with Havels or Dragonrider could be instantly killed with a well-timed jump Almost alwaysif a tool is good within a given circumstanceit is good because it allows you to more easily pressure an enemy with your swordthe tools just make that learning process easier For a lot of peopleI think that may be interpreted as an unreasonable demandas opposed to how it's described in the gameis a reinforcing feedback loop that punishes you for dying over and over through an implicit threat that dying results in the slowgradual death of friendly NPCs Maybe ""implicit"" isn't the word--it'd be closer to say that the game outright lies to youbecause none of these NPCs ever actually die or even close off their services because of dragonrot Not even if you die a million times Not only thatbut you can very easily produce a cure for dragonrotthough a temporary one If you start dying over and over againthe dragonrot will return To meit was a total non-issuedespite dying well over a hundred times I'm at the end of the gameno one has dragonrotand I have four cures ready to gowhen a game implements a system of negative reinforcementit's to prevent sloppy play But there are no actual consequences of dragonrotit's a mild inconvenience at best So why would From Software commit to a mechanic that has a tendency to induce panic and confusion in new playersbut doesn't really deter sloppy play at all for those who actually understand the mechanic?and the dragonrot system is there to act as a narrative means to all but outright scream at you to get better as quickly as possible There are other reasons why I think this--there are two bosses you can encounter within the first six hours of the game that are shockingly difficult and complex by conventional standard One boss in particularthough optionalis the equivalent of putting Lady Friede in the Cursed Tree's place Before playing Sekiroif you asked me if a boss with eight different attacks that can sometimes veer off into feints that all requires different responses and have enough damage to kill a player in two hits would be okay for the first third of the gameI would say ""Are you absolutely insane? Of course not!"" And indeedwhen I first encountered these bosses I suspectedbased on From's track recordthat these bosses were way over-tuned and that the end bosses would be a joke in comparison Nope! As difficult as these bosses arethey actually are unequivocally easier than the endgame bosses Which is why they're placed so early to begin withone could potentially avoid all damage by learning when to commit to rolls--whichordinarilywas not particularly difficult The continuous reliability of the rollin tandem with each new sequel making stamina management easier and easiermeant that experienced players could no longer be challenged by conventional Souls encounters Gimmicks were required to spice things upalmost all of which crashed and burnedand several introduced ways for combat to get even easier than it already wasall made in the name of providing a nearly insurmountable challenge--one that can no longer be vaulted overas the Souls challenges so often couldmiss the cheese But this is a game that knows exactly what it wants It wants you hyperfocused It wants your commitment It wants instinct-level reactions It IS a game that is ""difficult for the sake of being difficult""that is the point Claiming it is a ""game for masochists"" is honestly true on some level It will only be fun for those who opt in entirely to the experience Anything less and you will find yourself appalled The beauty and amazing level designthe fantastic musicthey exist only for those who want an absolutely insane gauntlet of challenges It's a videogame fight clubone I'm not sure I even want to be init's SekiroDon't go in expecting a Soulsborne gameI think it's a brilliant move FromSoft has set a narrative with this that makes for a -real- story to be told with the playerrather than AT the player like in other FromSoft titlesyou own everything currently available for itand doing some QA testingas wellRelease bloodborne for steamStarted playing this after finishing the Dark Souls series Looked similarplayed similaralrightI got thisI diedand contrary to every DS game I playedI didn't seem to improve I just raged more and more as the dragonrot kept piling up I felt myself going hollowso I took a breakread about other people's experience with the game Maybe it just wasn't for me?

1,"I can't explain this without getting emotionalbut every gamer has that one game... that one memorywhere it was just yousome friends and an absolutely great time. For me that time was Tekken 3with family back in '97.I get emotional writing this reviewbecause this game is not just a high quality PC portit is an amazing port of my childhoodmy memories.in every way that is a good thing. The game looks like Tekkenonly prettier than ever before. This game feels like Tekenand honestlythere is very little that I as a gamer appreciate more than a game genuinely crafted with passion that captures a memory.  A game that allows me to relive some of the happiest moments of my life and make for great new stories.I highly recommend you get this soon as you can.I love how this game makes you pay to view frame data. It really gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment!hitboxesand more in practice mode.Played this with my dad <3 Best quality father daughter timelol wtf a fighting game that works day 1 with working onlinestory modearcade modeetc. on PC?Wanted to get a decent number of hours before reviewing. I think its alright.One of the best fighting games ever!6 additional costumes1 stage. (2016)6 additional costumes. (2017)[/td]Colors)[/td]but what Crapcom did is disgusting. I wish they could learn from Bandai Namco. [spoiler]That's not gonna happen.[/spoiler]Street Fighter V is a good game. I can't deny it.they're both amazing!000 battles will unlock EVERYTHING in Tekken 7!!![/spoiler] But the DLC stuffs are not included.includes Rank BattleOnline TournamentsArcade BattleTreasure Battle and Local Multiplayer.Right so I just got out of training mode now I feel like I can choose my main characterYou get to throw a kid into a volcano in like the first 15 minutes.Tekken. Finally here. Let's hope Soul Calibur is next.Made me slowly start to quit league of legends. 10/10My favourite combo is ALT F4still needed to pay for a character even though i bought the ultimate edition im so sick of this practice.Finally a release that is playable and you know what you are paying for.you can easily train with on-display character combos;clothes that don't really fit character style.Finally a Tekken game for PC.+ Tekken finally has a PC-port and it's fantastic!short load-times and tons of peripheral support. This is a perfect example of a series transitioning to PC! If you like fighting-gamesthis is an absolute must-buy!but a massive skill-ceiling. You can buy this game and have a fantastic time even if you have never played a fighting game before. For the serious player the game features insane depth and a lot to enjoy. Tekken 7 has changed things such as throw-breaking and made things generally more streamlinedbut maintained it's complexety and depth. This really is the best Tekken has ever been.the roster is tightened up. Your favorite is most likely still in the game and the newcomers are generally good. Each character feels unique and I feel Namco has made good decisions on which characters to keep.the game has techinally been complete. This begs the question of what in the fuck Namco has been doing for 2 years. Customization is a joke compared to Tekken 6 and there are very few modes. There is also no replay-mode or anything outside the basic ranked online.the customization is especially sadening considering that there are so few characters and one would assume this means more options for each one.but it's basically a bunch of CG-cutcenes tied together with a terrible narrator and a hamfisted plot. The story makes no sensebut I can't really fault the game for it. Tekken has always been bonkers. Howevercompared to many other fighters it really falls flat and it has to be pointed out considering that the game offers very little other content.but there is only a question of time until someone bodies you. It's easy to feel lost in this gameyet the game makes very little effort to teach you anything. You are going to end up on YouTube and other sites to figure out combosframe-data etc. and that isn't good. There should at least be something here to teach new players the basics.rage-quitting is a SERIOUS problem. There is basically no punishment for quitting and if a player disconnects on youyou don't get the win. This becomes an even bigger problem in Tekkens tournament-mode. If the host gets mad he can kick you immediately or outright leave to shut down the entire lobby. As a resultplaying Tournament-mode is rather difficult.this is also frustratingly difficult. It can take 3-4 requests before you can accept a request to fight that actually works. As a result you will often end up in games with 3-bar connections because the game has not been able to connect to the players that fit the criteria you searched for. Most of the time you will be told that ""the connection to the opponent has been lost"". You might think that this is your potential opponent declining your requestbut in the majority of times it is in fact the game struggling to connect. Howeverthis will most likely be fixed and when it happens I will remove this from the review.every time I boot up this game I want to kill myselfTekken 7 is my first fighting game that I've decided to take seriously.the customisation allowed for each character is fairly large and overall the gameplay itself is fantastic. The movement in this game feels great and the combat itself is quite intensealong with some slow motion moments that pump you with adrenaline!the game runs completely fine without any hiccups (i5-4670kGTX 1060 6GB) and the load times are very short.for new players to Tekkenis the lack of tutorials. Some could argue that the story mode is the tutorialbut that's unacceptable. The story mode misses out a huge portion of mechanics hidden within the gamesuch as all of your recovery options when you're slammed onto the ground.outside of learning by yourself through practice mode or online matchesis to research tutorials and mechanics online.Nearly 1000 hours of playing. This game is still fun as the 1st dayand I'm really hyped for the upcoming Season Pass 4!pluggers).who are very diversehence IT HAS BECOME MORE ABOUT COMPLEXITY RATER THAN DEPTH!dont sell the ultimate edition and not give all dlc's its scummy and needs to stopif you like the game get it during the summer/winter salebut seriously dont support this sort of marketing when your still having to pay another 28$ for dlc charactersevery time I boot up this game I want to kill myself Started the campaign"
1,"Spawned as a Scientistand was a lone survivor since the SCPs killed almost every other DBoy/Scientist. Found an MTF trying to help me with the most soothing voice I have ever heard in my life. After what felt like an hour of escaping from the SCPs our friendship grow as we end up being trapped in a roomwhich was being camped by two SCPsand we proceed to talk to each other how badly we wanted to go on living and told us stories of what we wanted to achieve in lifelike see our wives again and visit other countriesalmost crying whilst doing so.and while it did workhe died in the process. I usually feel great accomplishment when I escape the facilitybut I only felt emptiness. Nothing was as fulfilling anymore and I felt like I would do anything to hear the soothing voice of my beloved friend just one more time.your sacrifice was not in vain.At firstI thought this was a janky bad mess. Looks badbugs out sometimeslimited floor and colour palettesand sometimes completely non-sensical maps.everything about this game got so much better - especially if everyone gets into their role. Telling everyone to hush over the radiobecause you've just heard something odd. The desparate panic that occurs when an SCP shows up. Being the last survivor in your NTF squadand praying for back-up. The joy of actually making it to the surface as D-Class.and can only be brought down through co-ordination.and are easily overwhelmed by SCPs / co-ordinated D-Classersor use diplomacy to stay alive. Finding a weapon really doesn't improve your chancesbut hellat least you feel safe now.or you can try and survive on your own. The NTF teams may be coming to help youbut honestlythey probably won't find you before they get butchered by something else.and play it with large groups over Discord. This is a game with extraordinary potential.This game is still really rough to playbut is absolutely fantastic. In my opinion there are roughly 5 kinds of players you need to be aware of before playing:spamming voice chatsaying weird stuffand pulling crazy shenanigans. Half the timethey're fun to play withthe other half of the timethey ruin everything.stop at nothing to accomplish their mission and play the game like its Rainbow Six. When playing in other rolesthey tend to still take it seriously and play the game ""by the rules"" as it were.they just grabbed this game cause it was free. They're lostthey don't know what's going onthey're screaming incoherentlyand tend to be the best Chaos Insurgency playerssimply because when a game gives you a machinegunyou already know you're gonna be gunning other people down.you don't even know if he hears youand generally winds up stuck in some backwards corner of the map alone and terrified. Except you don't know he's terrified because he can't talk.but mighty. Trust them with your life.-Spawn insweet freedomALL HAIL LORD PEANUT!"">be me-Be meso I give it to himgunsand other itemsthen respawn as MTF againplague doctorand ketchup dogsbecause I just want to talk to D-brolet me in""A dude blasted the halo theme through the mic while running away from scp 106. 10/10> join a server>Be scientistbut also D bois at gunpointshit's seriousthey're weeded out---{Audio}---That moment when a game made by 1 dude on twitch streams is more fun than most Triple A 60 Dollar/euro/whatever gamesI really like being touched by the big skinny white man with long armsIn this game you can:By farall you need to know before you download is:and serves more as a ground of improv.

You will more than likely get pwnd more than you could ever hope to make up for. This is a gamenot the Olympics.but I think I'll give it a shot.or ""SCIENTIST"" you are in the class that has a casualty rate of 9%but don't worry.find SCP-914upgrade said cardescape the bottom levelif you see men in green before thiscongrats! you'll escape in under a minute! if you see men in bluein short you'll either be arrestedor shot. the latter most likelyupgrade your assigned cardescape bottom level. if you see men in blueyou live!if they are greenyou are boned as they will never take prisoners.exterminate all the men in blueand maybe the white coats too. you don't need to kill anything else (though you CAN).and murder EVERYTHING ELSE (Orange men optionalyou can arrest thembut you need to stay with them.)and where D-class/Scientist go to escape even though most of them will never make it therebecause Chaos Insurgencyand the Mobile Task Force spawn up here. you will know that chaos is spawning if you see a vehicle drive into Gate Ayou'll know the Mobile Task Force is about to spawn when you see a Helicopter land at Gate B.also the reason why 99% of both Chaosand the MTF never show up to rescue those they are supposed to rescueas they are too busy fighting over who gets to use the intercomand sometimes erupts into a bloody skirmish even among members of your own teamthe Elevators to Gate A-B are also here.(Note: NEVER take the first elevator down to entrancethis is how you avoid the other noobs who throw grenades in elevator [SCP:Secret Lab Tradition at this point to throw a grenade in the elevator while your whole teams in it at least ONCE]after awhile you will be able to identify which SCP you are dealing with by the sound of their foostepsand adjust your course/approach promptly. Keep in mind that often times this place is RIDDLED with Tesla Gatesbut they are almost impossible to die from (unless there is an SCP-079check the cameras to see if they light up blue firstif so. don't cross. when the light goes outthen cross at your own descretion.)so i'll add this seeing how you like attention to detail:after the 15 minute markall doors will closeand a corrosive gas will be pumped via the air filtration systemkilling Players instantlyand giving the SCP's time to reflect on their obvious/foolish mistep. you will hear the Games announcer (non-player) warn you in 5 minute intervals.everyone is forced to blink in three seconds intervals when someone playing this cahracter is in the area so you can still SLOWLY dawdle towards your targetyou can snap their necks)this one is the most hated as he makes you a zombie. if you camp the elevators as this SCPsome players will try to make you suffer for doing this. I won't say how as these players who do this genually deserve itif you just leave the players dead at the elevators...just screenshot the pile of bodies before the reserves still stuck on the surface start sending down active grenades. He also apparently heals himself overtimeso don't be the guy who uses that to hold the game up for 7 hours.or 049 camped your elevatorand now you are one of his zombies. Most zombies tend to bump themselves off so you don't REALLY need to worry about them as a human characterunless there is a rule against that [some servers do] in which case most will PRETEND to chargeand ""Attack"" you. This is mostly a players way on conveying ""Up yours!"" to some owners for this rule. It's not breaking itbut not directly following it either. You will most likely NEVER kill anything as a zombie as it's mostly seen as the spectator rolebut you can move freelyand ""ATTACK"" (Enemy hit-register for this class is god-awfulborderline uselessso your attacks are garaunteed to missunless the target for whatever reason is standing perfectly still thus why most people hate this classand hate 049 for reviving them.)or guy thats in it for the laughs. You can tell this by how they talk over the various speakers throughout the facilitycan't use the intercom though. He can open all doorsand activate everything except the warheadand the intercom.and almost become a laughing stock in& of themselves for this. a COMPETENT tryhard 079 will corner you in a small roomand let the other SCPs finish you offalso very predictablebut not laughable. Would be scary if they would avoid using the speakers as once the (Human characters) Players hear your voiceit immediately removes 70% of the overall fear factor. it's not scary when you know who's behind the mask.)chat with the other playersand if they are feeling especially niceeven open doors for you.)then you go to LUDICROUS SPEED for 15 seconds before slowing back down the speed of an infant trying to learn how to stand upright. you can tell when he's near as you'll hear echoes of crying/sobbing.or the most annoying (Depends). He has the most terrifying Modeltakes reduced damageEnemy Hit-Register is also bad for this SCPbut it's not as bad/humiliating as 049-2& there is a reason. It balances out 106's ability to walk through doorsand teleport. If you know how to jump horny little bunny-rabbit lookin for some sugaryou can evade this guy 45% of the timeyou may feel your heart skip a beat when doing this thoughif he touched a human playersaid human will have to escape the pocket dimension.and talks. Thats it.  Just slow walk to a corner& avoid pressing against him.nobody knows what's going on and that's half the funIt's creepy if you make it creepybut the majority of the timeit's a hilariously chaotic mess. Play with friends for extra fun.A D-Class got stuck in an elevator and the entire server cooperated to get him out. 10/10 Faith in humanity restored.Pros:My experiences with this game:this SCP also chopped my hands offwith great graphics and plot.. this is not your game.if you wish to have fun and meet tons of fun strangers while also getting a thrill from the SCPthis is for you.I convinced scp-17 to spare me because I had a peanut allergy"
